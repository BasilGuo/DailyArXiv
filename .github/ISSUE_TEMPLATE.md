| **[An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14587v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their simplicity, linear models perform well at time series forecasting, even when pitted against deeper and more expensive models. A number of variations to the linear model have been proposed, often including some form of feature normalisation that improves model generalisation. In this paper we analyse the sets of functions expressible using these linear model architectures. In so doing we show that several popular variants of linear models for time series forecasting are equivalent and functionally indistinguishable from standard, unconstrained linear regression. We characterise the model classes for each linear variant. We demonstrate that each model can be reinterpreted as unconstrained linear regression over a suitably augmented feature set, and therefore admit closed-form solutions when using a mean-squared loss function. We provide experimental evidence that the models under inspection learn nearly identical solutions, and finally demonstrate that the simpler closed form solutions are superior forecasters across 72% of test settings.</p></details> |  |

River flow data typically have features of heavy tails and non-linearity, as large precipitation events cause sudden spikes in the data that then exponentially decay. Therefore, stationary Max-ARMA models are a suitable candidate for capturing the unique temporal dependence structure exhibited by river flows. This paper contributes to advancing our understanding of the extremal properties of stationary Max-ARMA processes. We detail the first approach for deriving the extremal index, the lagged asymptotic dependence coefficient, and an efficient simulation for a general Max-ARMA process. We use the extremal properties, coupled with the belief that Max-ARMA processes provide only an approximation to extreme river flow, to fit such a model which can broadly capture river flow behaviour over a high threshold. We make our inference under a reparametrisation which gives a simpler parameter space that excludes cases where any parameter is non-identifiable. We illustrate results for river flow data from the UK River Thames.</p></details> |  |
| **[In the Search for Optimal Multi-view Learning Models for Crop   Classification with Global Remote Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16582v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop classification is of critical importance due to its role in studying crop pattern changes, resource management, and carbon sequestration. When employing data-driven techniques for its prediction, utilizing various temporal data sources is necessary. Deep learning models have proven to be effective for this task by mapping time series data to high-level representation for prediction. However, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple input patterns. The literature offers limited guidance for Multi-View Learning (MVL) scenarios, as it has primarily focused on exploring fusion strategies with specific encoders and validating them in local regions. In contrast, we investigate the impact of simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and the encoder architecture evaluated on a global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoder architectures (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible MVL model configurations. The validation is on the CropHarvest dataset that provides optical, radar, and weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination, including encoder and fusion strategy, should be meticulously sought. To streamline this search process, we suggest initially identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a technical framework for researchers exploring crop classification or related tasks through a MVL approach.</p></details> |
| **[An experimental evaluation of choices of SSA forecasting parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16507v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Six time series related to atmospheric phenomena are used as inputs for experiments offorecasting with singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Existing methods for SSA parametersselection are compared throughout their forecasting accuracy relatively to an optimal aposteriori selection and to a naive forecasting methods. The comparison shows that awidespread practice of selecting longer windows leads often to poorer predictions. It alsoconfirms that the choices of the window length and of the grouping are essential. Withthe mean error of rainfall forecasting below 1.5%, SSA appears as a viable alternative forhorizons beyond two weeks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revue...</summary><p>Revue Africaine de Recherche en Informatique et Math{\'e}matiques   Appliqu{\'e}es, In press, 40</p></details> |

From its statistical feature, without any use of the Fourier transform, we find an almost periodic function which suitably characterizes the corresponding time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[L-MAE: Longitudinal masked auto-encoder with time and severity-aware   encoding for diabetic retinopathy progression prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16272v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training strategies based on self-supervised learning (SSL) have proven to be effective pretext tasks for many downstream tasks in computer vision. Due to the significant disparity between medical and natural images, the application of typical SSL is not straightforward in medical imaging. Additionally, those pretext tasks often lack context, which is critical for computer-aided clinical decision support. In this paper, we developed a longitudinal masked auto-encoder (MAE) based on the well-known Transformer-based MAE. In particular, we explored the importance of time-aware position embedding as well as disease progression-aware masking. Taking into account the time between examinations instead of just scheduling them offers the benefit of capturing temporal changes and trends. The masking strategy, for its part, evolves during follow-up to better capture pathological changes, ensuring a more accurate assessment of disease progression. Using OPHDIAT, a large follow-up screening dataset targeting diabetic retinopathy (DR), we evaluated the pre-trained weights on a longitudinal task, which is to predict the severity label of the next visit within 3 years based on the past time series examinations. Our results demonstrated the relevancy of both time-aware position embedding and masking strategies based on disease progression knowledge. Compared to popular baseline models and standard longitudinal Transformers, these simple yet effective extensions significantly enhance the predictive ability of deep classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An early warning indicator trained on stochastic disease-spreading   models with different noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16233v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The timely detection of disease outbreaks through reliable early warning signals (EWSs) is indispensable for effective public health mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, the intricate dynamics of real-world disease spread, often influenced by diverse sources of noise and limited data in the early stages of outbreaks, pose a significant challenge in developing reliable EWSs, as the performance of existing indicators varies with extrinsic and intrinsic noises. Here, we address the challenge of modeling disease when the measurements are corrupted by additive white noise, multiplicative environmental noise, and demographic noise into a standard epidemic mathematical model. To navigate the complexities introduced by these noise sources, we employ a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in infectious disease outbreak by training on noise-induced disease-spreading models. The indicator's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to real-world COVID-19 cases in Edmonton and simulated time series derived from diverse disease spread models affected by noise. Notably, the indicator captures an impending transition in a time series of disease outbreaks and outperforms existing indicators. This study contributes to advancing early warning capabilities by addressing the intricate dynamics inherent in real-world disease spread, presenting a promising avenue for enhancing public health preparedness and response efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Masked Model is All You Need for Sensor Fault Detection, Isolation   and Accommodation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16153v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable sensor measurements are critical for ensuring the safety and longevity of complex engineering systems such as wind turbines. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for sensor fault detection, isolation, and accommodation (FDIA) using masked models and self-supervised learning. Our proposed approach is a general time series modeling approach that can be applied to any neural network (NN) model capable of sequence modeling, and captures the complex spatio-temporal relationships among different sensors. During training, the proposed masked approach creates a random mask, which acts like a fault, for one or more sensors, making the training and inference task unified: finding the faulty sensors and correcting them. We validate our proposed technique on both a public dataset and a real-world dataset from GE offshore wind turbines, and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting, diagnosing and correcting sensor faults. The masked model not only simplifies the overall FDIA pipeline, but also outperforms existing approaches. Our proposed technique has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of sensor measurements in complex engineering systems in real-time, and could be applied to other types of sensors and engineering systems in the future. We believe that our proposed framework can contribute to the development of more efficient and effective FDIA techniques for a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2024 International Joint Conference on Neural   Networks (IJCNN 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Energy Budgets in Droplet Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural   Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16144v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting:   Learning from Leading Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548v3)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/SJTU-Quant/LIFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Scale Decomposition MLP-Mixer for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11959v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data, including univariate and multivariate ones, are characterized by unique composition and complex multi-scale temporal variations. They often require special consideration of decomposition and multi-scale modeling to analyze. Existing deep learning methods on this best fit to univariate time series only, and have not sufficiently considered sub-series modeling and decomposition completeness. To address these challenges, we propose MSD-Mixer, a Multi-Scale Decomposition MLP-Mixer, which learns to explicitly decompose and represent the input time series in its different layers. To handle the multi-scale temporal patterns and multivariate dependencies, we propose a novel temporal patching approach to model the time series as multi-scale patches, and employ MLPs to capture intra- and inter-patch variations and channel-wise correlations. In addition, we propose a novel loss function to constrain both the mean and the autocorrelation of the decomposition residual for better decomposition completeness. Through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets for five common time series analysis tasks, we demonstrate that MSD-Mixer consistently and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with better efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Long-term Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02023v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term forecasting presents unique challenges due to the time and memory complexity of handling long sequences. Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (i.e., outer-window variations). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by employing contrastive learning and enhanced decomposition architecture, specifically designed to focus on long-term variations. To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.

We deploy LAMPER in experimental assessments using 128 univariate TS datasets sourced from the UCR archive. Our findings indicate that the feature representation capacity of LAMPER is influenced by the maximum input token threshold imposed by PLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as tiny paper in ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Time-series Initialization and Conditioning for Video-agnostic   Stabilization of Video Super-Resolution using Recurrent Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15832v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Video Super Resolution (VSR) is generally trained with randomly clipped and cropped short videos extracted from original training videos due to various challenges in learning RNNs. However, since this RNN is optimized to super-resolve short videos, VSR of long videos is degraded due to the domain gap. Our preliminary experiments reveal that such degradation changes depending on the video properties, such as the video length and dynamics. To avoid this degradation, this paper proposes the training strategy of RNN for VSR that can work efficiently and stably independently of the video length and dynamics. The proposed training strategy stabilizes VSR by training a VSR network with various RNN hidden states changed depending on the video properties. Since computing such a variety of hidden states is time-consuming, this computational cost is reduced by reusing the hidden states for efficient training. In addition, training stability is further improved with frame-number conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performed better than base methods in videos with various lengths and dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2024 (International Joint Conference on Neural   Networks)</p></details> |
| **[AI for Biomedicine in the Era of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15673v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of AI for biomedicine span a wide spectrum, from the atomic level, where it solves partial differential equations for quantum systems, to the molecular level, predicting chemical or protein structures, and further extending to societal predictions like infectious disease outbreaks. Recent advancements in large language models, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, have showcased significant prowess in natural language tasks, such as translating languages, constructing chatbots, and answering questions. When we consider biomedical data, we observe a resemblance to natural language in terms of sequences: biomedical literature and health records presented as text, biological sequences or sequencing data arranged in sequences, or sensor data like brain signals as time series. The question arises: Can we harness the potential of recent large language models to drive biomedical knowledge discoveries? In this survey, we will explore the application of large language models to three crucial categories of biomedical data: 1) textual data, 2) biological sequences, and 3) brain signals. Furthermore, we will delve into large language model challenges in biomedical research, including ensuring trustworthiness, achieving personalization, and adapting to multi-modal data representation</p></details> |
