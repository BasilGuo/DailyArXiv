| **[Integrative Analysis of Financial Market Sentiment Using CNN and GRU for Risk Prediction and Alert Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10199v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This document presents an in-depth examination of stock market sentiment through the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), enabling precise risk alerts. The robust feature extraction capability of CNN is utilized to preprocess and analyze extensive network text data, identifying local features and patterns. The extracted feature sequences are then input into the GRU model to understand the progression of emotional states over time and their potential impact on future market sentiment and risk. This approach addresses the order dependence and long-term dependencies inherent in time series data, resulting in a detailed analysis of stock market sentiment and effective early warnings of future risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainties in Signal Recovery from Heterogeneous and Convoluted Time Series with Principal Component Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10175v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most used tools for extracting low-dimensional representations of data, in particular for time series. Performances are known to strongly depend on the quality (amount of noise) and the quantity of data. We here investigate the impact of heterogeneities, often present in real data, on the reconstruction of low-dimensional trajectories and of their associated modes. We focus in particular on the effects of sample-to-sample fluctuations and of component-dependent temporal convolution and noise in the measurements. We derive analytical predictions for the error on the reconstructed trajectory and the confusion between the modes using the replica method in a high-dimensional setting, in which the number and the dimension of the data are comparable. We find in particular that sample-to-sample variability, is deleterious for the reconstruction of the signal trajectory, but beneficial for the inference of the modes, and that the fluctuations in the temporal convolution kernels prevent perfect recovery of the latent modes even for very weak measurement noise. Our predictions are corroborated by simulations with synthetic data for a variety of control parameters.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[IGNITE: Individualized GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04402v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records present a valuable modality for driving personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to fit individual-level differences. For this purpose, many data-driven machine learning and statistical models rely on the wealth of longitudinal EHRs to study patients' physiological and treatment effects. However, longitudinal EHRs tend to be sparse and highly missing, where missingness could also be informative and reflect the underlying patient's health status. Therefore, the success of data-driven models for personalized medicine highly depends on how the EHR data is represented from physiological data, treatments, and the missing values in the data. To this end, we propose a novel deep-learning model that learns the underlying patient dynamics over time across multivariate data to generate personalized realistic values conditioning on an individual's demographic characteristics and treatments. Our proposed model, IGNITE (Individualized GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records), utilises a conditional dual-variational autoencoder augmented with dual-stage attention to generate missing values for an individual. In IGNITE, we further propose a novel individualized missingness mask (IMM), which helps our model generate values based on the individual's observed data and missingness patterns. We further extend the use of IGNITE from imputing missingness to a personalized data synthesizer, where it generates missing EHRs that were never observed prior or even generates new patients for various applications. We validate our model on three large publicly available datasets and show that IGNITE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in missing data reconstruction and task prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10053v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Portfolio Selection via Topological Data Analysis based Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16920v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper uses topological data analysis (TDA) tools and introduces a data-driven clustering-based stock selection strategy tailored for sparse portfolio construction. Our asset selection strategy exploits the topological features of stock price movements to select a subset of topologically similar (different) assets for a sparse index tracking (Markowitz) portfolio. We introduce new distance measures, which serve as an input to the clustering algorithm, on the space of persistence diagrams and landscapes that consider the time component of a time series. We conduct an empirical analysis on the S\&P index from 2009 to 2022, including a study on the COVID-19 data to validate the robustness of our methodology. Our strategy to integrate TDA with the clustering algorithm significantly enhanced the performance of sparse portfolios across various performance measures in diverse market scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Periodic Activation for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09889v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the lack of research on activation functions for neural network models in time series tasks. It highlights the need to identify essential properties of these activations to improve their effectiveness in specific domains. To this end, the study comprehensively analyzes properties, such as bounded, monotonic, nonlinearity, and periodicity, for activation in time series neural networks. We propose a new activation that maximizes the coverage of these properties, called LeakySineLU. We empirically evaluate the LeakySineLU against commonly used activations in the literature using 112 benchmark datasets for time series classification, obtaining the best average ranking in all comparative scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Financial Fine-tuning a Large Time Series Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09880v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models have shown unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, image generation, and most recently, time series forecasting. This leads us to ask the question: treating market prices as a time series, can large models be used to predict the market? In this paper, we answer this by evaluating the performance of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price prediction. We find that due to the irregular nature of price data, directly applying TimesFM gives unsatisfactory results and propose to fine-tune TimeFM on financial data for the task of price prediction. This is done by continual pre-training of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price data containing 100 million time points, spanning a range of financial instruments spanning hourly and daily granularities. The fine-tuned model demonstrates higher price prediction accuracy than the baseline model. We conduct mock trading for our model in various financial markets and show that it outperforms various benchmarks in terms of returns, sharpe ratio, max drawdown and trading cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Time Series Clustering for Environmental State Characterization of Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09832v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gravitational-wave observatories like LIGO are large-scale, terrestrial instruments housed in infrastructure that spans a multi-kilometer geographic area and which must be actively controlled to maintain operational stability for long observation periods. Despite exquisite seismic isolation, they remain susceptible to seismic noise and other terrestrial disturbances that can couple undesirable vibrations into the instrumental infrastructure, potentially leading to control instabilities or noise artifacts in the detector output. It is, therefore, critical to characterize the seismic state of these observatories to identify a set of temporal patterns that can inform the detector operators in day-to-day monitoring and diagnostics. On a day-to-day basis, the operators monitor several seismically relevant data streams to diagnose operational instabilities and sources of noise using some simple empirically-determined thresholds. It can be untenable for a human operator to monitor multiple data streams in this manual fashion and thus a distillation of these data-streams into a more human-friendly format is sought. In this paper, we present an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for features-based multivariate time series clustering to achieve this goal and to provide actionable insights to the detector operators by correlating found clusters with events of interest in the detector.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to The 5th International Workshop on Big Data & AI Tools, Methods, and Use Cases for Innovative Scientific Discovery (BTSD 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Online and Offline Experts for Non-stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05996v3)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a general and realistic scenario involving non-stationary time series, consisting of several offline intervals with different distributions within a fixed offline time horizon, and an online interval that continuously receives new samples. For non-stationary time series, the data distribution in the current online interval may have appeared in previous offline intervals. We theoretically explore the feasibility of applying knowledge from offline intervals to the current online interval. To this end, we propose the Mixture of Online and Offline Experts (MOOE). MOOE learns static offline experts from offline intervals and maintains a dynamic online expert for the current online interval. It then adaptively combines the offline and online experts using a meta expert to make predictions for the samples received in the online interval. Specifically, we focus on theoretical analysis, deriving parameter convergence, regret bounds, and generalization error bounds to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Change Point Detection in High-dimensional Vector Auto-regressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09794v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential (online) change-point detection involves continuously monitoring time-series data and triggering an alarm when shifts in the data distribution are detected. We propose an algorithm for real-time identification of alterations in the transition matrices of high-dimensional vector autoregressive models. The algorithm estimates transition matrices and error term variances using regularization techniques applied to training data, then computes a specific test statistic to detect changes in transition matrices as new data batches arrive. We establish the asymptotic normality of the test statistic under the scenario of no change points, subject to mild conditions. An alarm is raised when the calculated test statistic exceeds a predefined quantile of the standard normal distribution. We demonstrate that, as the size of the change (jump size) increases, the test power approaches one. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated empirically across various simulation scenarios. Finally, we present two applications of the proposed methodology: analyzing shocks in S&P 500 data and detecting the timing of seizures in EEG data.</p></details> | <details><summary>78 pa...</summary><p>78 pages, 20 figures, to be published in Statistica Sinica</p></details> |
| **[Flexible Bayesian Nonparametric Product Mixtures for Multi-scale Functional Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09792v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a rich literature on clustering functional data with applications to time-series modeling, trajectory data, and even spatio-temporal applications. However, existing methods routinely perform global clustering that enforces identical atom values within the same cluster. Such grouping may be inadequate for high-dimensional functions, where the clustering patterns may change between the more dominant high-level features and the finer resolution local features. While there is some limited literature on local clustering approaches to deal with the above problems, these methods are typically not scalable to high-dimensional functions, and their theoretical properties are not well-investigated. Focusing on basis expansions for high-dimensional functions, we propose a flexible non-parametric Bayesian approach for multi-resolution clustering. The proposed method imposes independent Dirichlet process (DP) priors on different subsets of basis coefficients that ultimately results in a product of DP mixture priors inducing local clustering. We generalize the approach to incorporate spatially correlated error terms when modeling random spatial functions to provide improved model fitting. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for implementation. We show posterior consistency properties under the local clustering approach that asymptotically recovers the true density of random functions. Extensive simulations illustrate the improved clustering and function estimation under the proposed method compared to classical approaches. We apply the proposed approach to a spatial transcriptomics application where the goal is to infer clusters of genes with distinct spatial patterns of expressions. Our method makes an important contribution by expanding the limited literature on local clustering methods for high-dimensional functions with theoretical guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[WormKAN: Are KAN Effective for Identifying and Tracking Concept Drift in Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10041v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic concepts in time series are crucial for understanding complex systems such as financial markets, healthcare, and online activity logs. These concepts help reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better decision-making and forecasting. However, existing models often struggle to detect and track concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and adaptability. To address this challenge, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose WormKAN, a concept-aware KAN-based model to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN consists of three key components: Patch Normalization, Temporal Representation Module, and Concept Dynamics. Patch normalization processes co-evolving time series into patches, treating them as fundamental modeling units to capture local dependencies while ensuring consistent scaling. The temporal representation module learns robust latent representations by leveraging a KAN-based autoencoder, complemented by a smoothness constraint, to uncover inter-patch correlations. Concept dynamics identifies and tracks dynamic transitions, revealing structural shifts in the time series through concept identification and drift detection. These transitions, akin to passing through a \textit{wormhole}, are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space. Experiments show that KAN and KAN-based models (WormKAN) effectively segment time series into meaningful concepts, enhancing the identification and tracking of concept drift.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Foundation Model for Multivariate Wearable Sensing of Physiological Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09758v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series foundation models have the ability to run inference, mainly forecasting, on any type of time series data, thanks to the informative representations comprising waveform features. Wearable sensing data, on the other hand, contain more variability in both patterns and frequency bands of interest and generally emphasize more on the ability to infer healthcare-related outcomes. The main challenge of crafting a foundation model for wearable sensing physiological signals is to learn generalizable representations that support efficient adaptation across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. In this work, we propose NormWear, a step toward such a foundation model, aiming to extract generalized and informative wearable sensing representations. NormWear has been pretrained on a large set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public resources. For a holistic assessment, we perform downstream evaluation on 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in the areas of mental health, body state inference, biomarker estimations, and disease risk evaluations. We demonstrate that NormWear achieves a better performance improvement over competitive baselines in general time series foundation modeling. In addition, leveraging a novel representation-alignment-match-based method, we align physiological signals embeddings with text embeddings. This alignment enables our proposed foundation model to perform zero-shot inference, allowing it to generalize to previously unseen wearable signal-based health applications. Finally, we perform nonlinear dynamic analysis on the waveform features extracted by the model at each intermediate layer. This analysis quantifies the model's internal processes, offering clear insights into its behavior and fostering greater trust in its inferences among end users.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at: http://github.com/Mobile-Sensing-and-UbiComp-Laboratory/NormWear</p></details> |
| **[Agtech Framework for Cranberry-Ripening Analysis Using Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09739v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural domains are being transformed by recent advances in AI and computer vision that support quantitative visual evaluation. Using aerial and ground imaging over a time series, we develop a framework for characterizing the ripening process of cranberry crops, a crucial component for precision agriculture tasks such as comparing crop breeds (high-throughput phenotyping) and detecting disease. Using drone imaging, we capture images from 20 waypoints across multiple bogs, and using ground-based imaging (hand-held camera), we image same bog patch using fixed fiducial markers. Both imaging methods are repeated to gather a multi-week time series spanning the entire growing season. Aerial imaging provides multiple samples to compute a distribution of albedo values. Ground imaging enables tracking of individual berries for a detailed view of berry appearance changes. Using vision transformers (ViT) for feature detection after segmentation, we extract a high dimensional feature descriptor of berry appearance. Interpretability of appearance is critical for plant biologists and cranberry growers to support crop breeding decisions (e.g.\ comparison of berry varieties from breeding programs). For interpretability, we create a 2D manifold of cranberry appearance by using a UMAP dimensionality reduction on ViT features. This projection enables quantification of ripening paths and a useful metric of ripening rate. We demonstrate the comparison of four cranberry varieties based on our ripening assessments. This work is the first of its kind and has future impact for cranberries and for other crops including wine grapes, olives, blueberries, and maize. Aerial and ground datasets are made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.00028</p></details> |
| **[Soybean Maturity Prediction using 2D Contour Plots from Drone based Time Series Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09696v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plant breeding programs require assessments of days to maturity for accurate selection and placement of entries in appropriate tests. In the early stages of the breeding pipeline, soybean breeding programs assign relative maturity ratings to experimental varieties that indicate their suitable maturity zones. Traditionally, the estimation of maturity value for breeding varieties has involved breeders manually inspecting fields and assessing maturity value visually. This approach relies heavily on rater judgment, making it subjective and time-consuming. This study aimed to develop a machine-learning model for evaluating soybean maturity using UAV-based time-series imagery. Images were captured at three-day intervals, beginning as the earliest varieties started maturing and continuing until the last varieties fully matured. The data collected for this experiment consisted of 22,043 plots collected across three years (2021 to 2023) and represent relative maturity groups 1.6 - 3.9. We utilized contour plot images extracted from the time-series UAV RGB imagery as input for a neural network model. This contour plot approach encoded the temporal and spatial variation within each plot into a single image. A deep learning model was trained to utilize this contour plot to predict maturity ratings. This model significantly improves accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 85% accuracy. We also evaluate the model's accuracy as we reduce the number of time points, quantifying the trade-off between temporal resolution and maturity prediction. The predictive model offers a scalable, objective, and efficient means of assessing crop maturity, enabling phenomics and ML approaches to reduce the reliance on manual inspection and subjective assessment. This approach enables the automatic prediction of relative maturity ratings in a breeding program, saving time and resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Reliability of Cable Broadband Networks via Proactive Network Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09564v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable broadband networks are one of the few "last-mile" broadband technologies widely available in the U.S. Unfortunately, they have poor reliability after decades of deployment. The cable industry proposed a framework called Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) to diagnose the cable networks. However, there is little public knowledge or systematic study on how to use these data to detect and localize cable network problems. Existing tools in the public domain have prohibitive high false-positive rates. In this paper, we propose CableMon, the first public-domain system that applies machine learning techniques to PNM data to improve the reliability of cable broadband networks. CableMon tackles two key challenges faced by cable ISPs: accurately detecting failures, and distinguishing whether a failure occurs within a network or at a subscriber's premise. CableMon uses statistical models to generate features from time series data and uses customer trouble tickets as hints to infer abnormal/failure thresholds for these generated features. Further, CableMon employs an unsupervised learning model to group cable devices sharing similar anomalous patterns and effectively identify impairments that occur inside a cable network and impairments occur at a subscriber's premise, as these two different faults require different types of technical personnel to repair them. We use eight months of PNM data and customer trouble tickets from an ISP and experimental deployment to evaluate CableMon's performance. Our evaluation results show that CableMon can effectively detect and distinguish failures from PNM data and outperforms existing public-domain tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages including reference.

| **[Predicting Coastal Water Levels in the Context of Climate Change Using Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Time Series Analysis Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09419v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given recent increases in ocean water levels brought on by climate change, this investigation decomposed changes in coastal water levels into its fundamental components to predict maximum water levels for a given coastal location. The study focused on Virginia Key, Florida, in the United States, located near the coast of Miami. Hourly mean lower low water (MLLW) levels were obtained from the National Data Buoy Center from January 28, 1994, through December 31, 2023. In the temporal dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filters were used to extract long-term trends, annual and daily tides, and higher frequency harmonics, while in the spectral dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing were used to confirm known tidal frequencies and periods. A linear model predicted that the long-term trend in water level will rise 2.02 feet from January 1994 to December 2050, while a quadratic model predicted a rise of 5.91 during the same period. In addition, the combined crests of annual tides, daily tides, and higher frequency harmonics increase water levels up to 2.16 feet, yielding a combined total of 4.18 feet as a lower bound and a combined total of 8.09 feet as an upper bound. These findings provide a foundation for more accurate prediction of coastal flooding during severe weather events and provide an impetus for policy choices with respect to residential communities, businesses, and wildlife habitats. Further, using Kolmogorov-Zurbenko analytic methods to study coastal sites throughout the world could draw a more comprehensive picture of the impact climate change is having on coastal waters globally.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, this article draws from arXiv:2007.03031v3 and arXiv:2412.07735v1</p></details> |
| **[Prediction Aided by Surrogate Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09364v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of prediction problems in which relatively few observations have associated responses, but all observations include both standard covariates as well as additional "helper" covariates. While the end goal is to make high-quality predictions using only the standard covariates, helper covariates can be exploited during training to improve prediction. Helper covariates arise in many applications, including forecasting in time series; incorporation of biased or mis-calibrated predictions from foundation models; and sharing information in transfer learning. We propose "prediction aided by surrogate training" ($\texttt{PAST}$), a class of methods that exploit labeled data to construct a response estimator based on both the standard and helper covariates; and then use the full dataset with pseudo-responses to train a predictor based only on standard covariates. We establish guarantees on the prediction error of this procedure, with the response estimator allowed to be constructed in an arbitrary way, and the final predictor fit by empirical risk minimization over an arbitrary function class. These upper bounds involve the risk associated with the oracle data set (all responses available), plus an overhead that measures the accuracy of the pseudo-responses. This theory characterizes both regimes in which $\texttt{PAST}$ accuracy is comparable to the oracle accuracy, as well as more challenging regimes where it behaves poorly. We demonstrate its empirical performance across a range of applications, including forecasting of societal ills over time with future covariates as helpers; prediction of cardiovascular risk after heart attacks with prescription data as helpers; and diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-rays using machine-generated predictions as helpers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantitative Evaluation of Motif Sets in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09346v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Motif Discovery (TSMD), which aims at finding recurring patterns in time series, is an important task in numerous application domains, and many methods for this task exist. These methods are usually evaluated qualitatively. A few metrics for quantitative evaluation, where discovered motifs are compared to some ground truth, have been proposed, but they typically make implicit assumptions that limit their applicability. This paper introduces PROM, a broadly applicable metric that overcomes those limitations, and TSMD-Bench, a benchmark for quantitative evaluation of time series motif discovery. Experiments with PROM and TSMD-Bench show that PROM provides a more comprehensive evaluation than existing metrics, that TSMD-Bench is a more challenging benchmark than earlier ones, and that the combination can help understand the relative performance of TSMD methods. More generally, the proposed approach enables large-scale, systematic performance comparisons in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto-Regressive Moving Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09328v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is essential in various domains, and recent advancements in diffusion-based TSF models have shown considerable promise. However, these models typically adopt traditional diffusion patterns, treating TSF as a noise-based conditional generation task. This approach neglects the inherent continuous sequential nature of time series, leading to a fundamental misalignment between diffusion mechanisms and the TSF objective, thereby severely impairing performance. To bridge this misalignment, and inspired by the classic Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) theory, which views time series as continuous sequential progressions evolving from previous data points, we propose a novel Auto-Regressive Moving Diffusion (ARMD) model to first achieve the continuous sequential diffusion-based TSF. Unlike previous methods that start from white Gaussian noise, our model employs chain-based diffusion with priors, accurately modeling the evolution of time series and leveraging intermediate state information to improve forecasting accuracy and stability. Specifically, our approach reinterprets the diffusion process by considering future series as the initial state and historical series as the final state, with intermediate series generated using a sliding-based technique during the forward process. This design aligns the diffusion model's sampling procedure with the forecasting objective, resulting in an unconditional, continuous sequential diffusion TSF model. Extensive experiments conducted on seven widely used datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing diffusion-based TSF models. Our code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/daxin007/ARMD.</p></details> | no comment |

Although these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solutions by industry, they are rarely considered in the comparisons that generally almost exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the case in industrial time-series. Two examples are given to assess the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures, 3 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to explore the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, web traffic has different distributions coming from various sources as well as the imbalance between normal and abnormal categories, it is difficult to accurately and efficiently identify abnormal web traffic. Deep neural network approaches for web traffic anomaly detection have achieved cutting-edge classification performance. In order to achieve high-performance spatiotemporal detection of network attacks, we innovatively design WT-CFormer, which integrates Transformer and CNN, effectively capturing the temporal and spatial characteristics. We conduct a large numbr of experiments to evaluate the method we proposed. The results show that WT-CFormer has the highest performance, obtaining a recall as high as 96.79%, a precision of 97.35%, an F1 score of 97.07%, and an accuracy of 99.43%, which is 7.09%,1.15%, 4.77%, and 0.83% better than the state-of-the-art method, followed by C-LSTM, CTGA, random forest, and KNN algorithms. In addition, we find that the classification performance of WT-CFormer with only 50 training epochs outperforms C-LSTM with 500 training epochs, which greatly improves the convergence performance. Finally, we perform ablation experiments to demonstrate the necessity of each component within WT-CFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Global Carbon Budget as a cointegrated system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09226v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Global Carbon Budget, maintained by the Global Carbon Project, summarizes Earth's global carbon cycle through four annual time series beginning in 1959: atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions, and CO$_2$ uptake by land and ocean. We analyze these four time series as a multivariate (cointegrated) system. Statistical tests show that the four time series are cointegrated with rank three and identify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions as the single stochastic trend driving the nonstationary dynamics of the system. The three cointegrated relations correspond to the physical relations that the sinks are linearly related to atmospheric concentrations and that the change in concentrations equals emissions minus the combined uptake by land and ocean. Furthermore, likelihood ratio tests show that a parametrically restricted error-correction model that embodies these physical relations and accounts for the El-Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation cannot be rejected on the data. Finally, projections based on this model, using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios, yield results consistent with established climate science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08906v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a general-purpose time series foundation models with robust generalization capabilities across diverse applications from scratch is still an open challenge. Efforts are primarily focused on fusing cross-domain time series datasets to extract shared subsequences as tokens for training models on Transformer architecture. However, due to significant statistical heterogeneity across domains, this cross-domain fusing approach doesn't work effectively as the same as fusing texts and images. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel federated learning approach to address the heterogeneity in time series foundation models training, namely FFTS. Specifically, each data-holding organization is treated as an independent client in a collaborative learning framework with federated settings, and then many client-specific local models will be trained to preserve the unique characteristics per dataset. Moreover, a new regularization mechanism will be applied to both client-side and server-side, thus to align the shared knowledge across heterogeneous datasets from different domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed federated learning approach. The newly learned time series foundation models achieve superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain time series analysis tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Main Track in AAAI'25</p></details> |

Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | accepted at AAAI'25 |

These factors, combined with the nontransparent nature of black-box Machine Learning models impede interpretability and hinder human comprehension of model behavior. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring strategies to enhance interpretability through white-box approaches, which provide actionable insights into latent space dynamics and model behavior during training. By leveraging human intuition and expertise, the proposed framework improves explainability, fosters trust, and promotes transparent Human Activity Recognition systems. A key contribution is the proposal of a Human-in-the-Loop framework that enables dynamic user interaction with models, facilitating iterative refinements to enhance performance and efficiency. Additionally, we investigate the usefulness of Large Language Model as an assistance to provide users with guidance for interpreting visualizations, diagnosing issues, and optimizing workflows. Together, these contributions present a scalable and efficient framework for developing interpretable and accessible Human Activity Recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoPlant: Spatial Plant Species Prediction Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13928v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multimodal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10--50m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time series of climatic variables, and satellite time series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first operates by estimating the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models. The empirical study demonstrates that our proposed \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025.

Although we have developed an online acquisition method of the nonlinear relationship between joints and muscles, we could not completely match the actual robot and its self-body image. When realizing a certain task, the direct relationship between the control input and task state needs to be learned. So, we construct a neural network representing the time-series relationship between the control input and task state, and realize the intended task state by applying the network to a real-time control. In this research, we conduct accelerator pedal control experiments as one application, and verify the effectiveness of this study.</p></details> | Accepted at IROS2019 |

In the frame of functional outputs, a common goal is to compute sensitivity maps (SM), i.e sensitivity indices at each output dimension (e.g. time step for time series, or pixels for spatial outputs). In specific settings, some works have shown that the computation of Sobol' SM can be speeded up by using basis expansions employed for dimension reduction. However, how to efficiently compute such SM in a general setting has not received too much attention in the GSA literature.In this work, we propose fast computations of Sobol' SM using a general basis expansion, with a focus on statistical estimation. First, we write a closed-form expression of SM in function of the matrix-valued Sobol' index of the vector of basis coefficients. Secondly, we consider pick-freeze (PF) estimators, which have nice statistical properties (in terms of asymptotical efficiency) for Sobol' indices of any order. We provide similar basis-derived formulas for the PF estimator of Sobol' SM in function of the matrix-valued PF estimator of the vector of basis coefficients. We give the computational cost, and show that, compared to a dimension-wise approach, the computational gain is substantial and allows to calculate both SM and their associated bootstrap confidence bounds in a reasonable time. Finally, we illustrate the whole methodology on an analytical test case and on an application in non-Newtonian hydraulics, modelling an idealized dam-break flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-optimal persistent homology representatives for univariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08209v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main methods used in Topological Data Analysis. An active area of research in the field is the study of appropriate notions of PH representatives, which allow to interpret the meaning of the information provided by PH, making it an important problem in the application of PH, and in the study of its interpretability. Computing optimal PH representatives is a problem that is known to be NP-hard, and one is therefore interested in developing context-specific optimality notions that are computable in practice. Here we introduce time-optimal PH representatives for time-varying data, allowing one to extract representatives that are close in time in an appropriate sense. We illustrate our methods on quasi-periodic synthetic time series, as well as time series arising from climate models, and we show that our methods provide optimal PH representatives that are better suited for these types of problems than existing optimality notions, such as length-optimal PH representatives.</p></details> | 30 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Tube Loss: A Novel Approach for Prediction Interval Estimation and probabilistic forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06853v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks. The codes of the experiments are available at https://github.com/ltpritamanand/Tube_loss</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Driving Patterns Using High Resolution Telematics Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08106v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle telematics provides granular data for dynamic driving risk assessment, but current methods often rely on aggregated metrics (e.g., harsh braking counts) and do not fully exploit the rich time-series structure of telematics data. In this paper, we introduce a flexible framework using continuous-time hidden Markov model (CTHMM) to model and analyze trip-level telematics data. Unlike existing methods, the CTHMM models raw time-series data without predefined thresholds on harsh driving events or assumptions about accident probabilities. Moreover, our analysis is based solely on telematics data, requiring no traditional covariates such as driver or vehicle characteristics. Through unsupervised anomaly detection based on pseudo-residuals, we identify deviations from normal driving patterns -- defined as the prevalent behaviour observed in a driver's history or across the population -- which are linked to accident risk. Validated on both controlled and real-world datasets, the CTHMM effectively detects abnormal driving behaviour and trips with increased accident likelihood. In real-data analysis, higher anomaly levels in longitudinal and lateral accelerations consistently correlate with greater accident risk, with classification models using this information achieving ROC-AUC values as high as 0.86 for trip-level analysis and 0.78 for distinguishing drivers with claims. Furthermore, the methodology reveals significant behavioural differences between drivers with and without claims, offering valuable insights for insurance applications, accident analysis, and prevention.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to handle the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in climate data. To address these challenges, we propose a weather prediction model based on a multi-scale convolutional CNN-LSTM-Attention architecture, specifically designed for time series forecasting of temperature data in China. The model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms to leverage the strengths of spatial feature extraction, temporal sequence modeling, and the ability to focus on important features. The development process of the model includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building. Experimental results show that the model performs excellently in predicting temperature trends with high accuracy. The final computed results indicate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 1.978295 and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is 0.8106562. This work marks a significant advancement in applying deep learning techniques to meteorological data, offering a valuable tool for improving weather forecasting accuracy and providing essential support for decision-making in areas such as urban planning, agriculture, and energy management.</p></details> |  |

Only under this guarantee methods are legitimate to artificially generate data, for example, to counteract imbalanced datasets or provide counterfactual explanations for blackbox decision-making systems. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown considerable results in forming stable representations and generating realistic data. While many applications focus on generating image data, less effort has been made in generating time series data, especially multivariate signals. In this work, a Transformer-based autoencoder is proposed that is regularized using an adversarial training scheme to generate artificial multivariate time series signals. The representation is evaluated using t-SNE visualizations, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Entropy scores. Our results indicate that the generated signals exhibit higher similarity to an exemplary dataset than using a convolutional network approach.</p></details> |  |

While quantum computing offers potential beyond classical systems, the advantages of quantum neural networks (QNNs) remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present and examine a quantum circuit (QC) that implements and aims to improve upon the classical echo-state network (ESN), a type of reservoir-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs), using quantum computers. Typically, ESNs consist of an extremely large reservoir that learns high-dimensional embeddings, enabling prediction of complex system trajectories. Quantum echo-state networks (QESNs) aim to reduce this need for prohibitively large reservoirs by leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum computers, potentially allowing for more efficient and higher performing time-series prediction algorithms. The proposed QESN can be implemented on any digital quantum computer implementing a universal gate set, and does not require any sort of stopping or re-initialization of the circuit, allowing continuous evolution of the quantum state over long time horizons. We conducted simulated QC experiments on the chaotic Lorenz system, both with noisy and noiseless models, to demonstrate the circuit's performance and its potential for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 figures, submitted to AAAI QC+AI workshop</p></details> |

Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments, on experiments with electroencephalography data, and on experiments with optogentic stimulation and micro-electrocorticography data.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p></details> |  |

Our newly recorded, naturally confounded dataset named P2S from a real mechanical production line emphasizes this. To avoid "Clever-Hans" moments in time series, i.e., to mitigate confounders, we introduce the method Right on Time (RioT). RioT enables, for the first time, interactions with model explanations across both the time and frequency domain. Feedback on explanations in both domains is then used to constrain the model, steering it away from the annotated confounding factors. The dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing confounders in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate that RioT can effectively guide models away from the wrong reasons in P2S as well as popular time series classification and forecasting datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we argue that the salient information of a number of time series is more likely to be localized in the frequency domain. We propose FreqRISE, which uses masking-based methods to produce explanations in the frequency and time-frequency domain, and outperforms strong baselines across a number of tasks.

However, each new vehicle has its new characteristics or parameters. The identification of these is the main task of an engineer. To validate whether the correct parameter set has been chosen is a tedious task and often can only be performed by experts. Metrics known commonly used in literature are able to compare different results under certain aspects. However, they fail to answer the question: Are the models accurate enough? In this article, we propose the usage of a custom metric trained on the knowledge of experts to tackle this problem. Our approach involves three main steps: first, the formalized collection of subject matter experts' opinion on the question: Having seen the measurement and simulation time series in comparison, is the model quality sufficient? From this step, we obtain a data set that is able to quantify the sufficiency of a simulation result based on a comparison to corresponding experimental data. In a second step, we compute common model metrics on the measurement and simulation time series and use these model metrics as features to a regression model. Third, we fit a regression model to the experts' opinions. This regression model, i.e., our custom metric, can than predict the sufficiency of a new simulation result and gives a confidence on this prediction.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Among these advancements, deep learning and predictive modelling have emerged as transformative tools for optimizing clinical trial design, patient recruitment, and real-time monitoring. This study explores the application of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks [CNNs] and transformerbased models, to stratify patients, forecast adverse events, and personalize treatment plans. Furthermore, predictive modelling approaches, including survival analysis and time-series forecasting, are employed to predict trial outcomes, enhancing efficiency and reducing trial failure rates. To address challenges in analysing unstructured clinical data, such as patient notes and trial protocols, natural language processing [NLP] techniques are utilized for extracting actionable insights. A custom dataset comprising structured patient demographics, genomic data, and unstructured text is curated for training and validating these models. Key metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 scores, are used to evaluate model performance, while trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency are examined to identify the optimal model for clinical deployment. This research underscores the potential of AI-driven methods to streamline clinical trial workflows, improve patient-centric outcomes, and reduce costs associated with trial inefficiencies. The findings provide a robust framework for integrating predictive analytics into precision medicine, paving the way for more adaptive and efficient clinical trials. By bridging the gap between technological innovation and real-world applications, this study contributes to advancing the role of AI in healthcare, particularly in fostering personalized care and improving overall trial success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages excluding references, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit $\unicode{x2014}$ such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</p></details> |  |

The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation, where we achieve likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.\href{https://github.com/MrRezaeiUofT/IDFF}{Github Repository}</p></details> |  |

Canada's Food Price Report (CPFR) is an annual publication that predicts food inflation over the next calendar year. The published predictions are a collaborative effort between forecasting teams that each employ their own approach at Canadian Universities: Dalhousie University, the University of British Columbia, the University of Saskatchewan, and the University of Guelph/Vector Institute. While the University of Guelph/Vector Institute forecasting team has leveraged machine learning (ML) in previous reports, the most recent editions (2024--2025) have also included a human-in-the-loop approach. For the 2025 report, this focus was expanded to evaluate several different data-centric approaches to improve forecast accuracy. In this study, we evaluate how different types of forecasting models perform when estimating food price fluctuations. We also examine the sensitivity of models that curate time series data representing key factors in food pricing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Selection for Comparing High-dimensional Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06870v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a pair of multivariate time-series data of the same length and dimensions, an approach is proposed to select variables and time intervals where the two series are significantly different. In applications where one time series is an output from a computationally expensive simulator, the approach may be used for validating the simulator against real data, for comparing the outputs of two simulators, and for validating a machine learning-based emulator against the simulator. With the proposed approach, the entire time interval is split into multiple subintervals, and on each subinterval, the two sample sets are compared to select variables that distinguish their distributions and a two-sample test is performed. The validity and limitations of the proposed approach are investigated in synthetic data experiments. Its usefulness is demonstrated in an application with a particle-based fluid simulator, where a deep neural network model is compared against the simulator, and in an application with a microscopic traffic simulator, where the effects of changing the simulator's parameters on traffic flows are analysed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data on Human Gesture Recognition Tasks Using GANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06389v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is an emerging interest in employing Deep Generative Models (DGMs) to address data scarcity, enhance data quality, and improve classification metrics scores. Among these types of models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have arisen as a powerful tool for generating synthetic data that mimic real-world scenarios with high fidelity. However, Human Gesture Recognition (HGR), a subset of HAR, particularly in healthcare applications, using time series data such as allergic gestures, remains highly unexplored. In this paper, we examine and evaluate the performance of two GANs in the generation of synthetic gesture motion data that compose a part of an open-source benchmark dataset. The data is related to the disease identification domain and healthcare, specifically to allergic rhinitis. We also focus on these AI models' performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, and privacy. Furthermore, we examine the scenario if the synthetic data can substitute real data, in training scenarios and how well models trained on synthetic data can be generalized for the allergic rhinitis gestures. In our work, these gestures are related to 6-axes accelerometer and gyroscope data, serving as multi-variate time series instances, and retrieved from smart wearable devices. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the feasibility of synthesizing motion gestures for allergic rhinitis from wearable IoT device data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and testing their impact on the generalization of gesture recognition systems. It is worth noting that, even if our method has been applied to a specific category of gestures, it is designed to be generalized and can be deployed also to other motion data in the HGR domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Pre-training Data Quality without Labels for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06368v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models that generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation models is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to collect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the performance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of the data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new measure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the foundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the proposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream tasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to search for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve thereby the foundation model's generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMS-AutoTSF: Learnable Multi-Scale Decomposition and Integrated Autocorrelation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06866v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, scientific simulations and industrial process analysis. In this work, we introduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that incorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at multiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing the model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components directly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers to handle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domain filtering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wise transformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-term dependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficiently compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensures faster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting across diverse time horizons.

| **[Mining Limited Data Sufficiently: A BERT-inspired Approach for CSI Time Series Application in Wireless Communication and Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06861v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel State Information (CSI) is the cornerstone in both wireless communication and sensing systems. In wireless communication systems, CSI provides essential insights into channel conditions, enabling system optimizations like channel compensation and dynamic resource allocation. However, the high computational complexity of CSI estimation algorithms necessitates the development of fast deep learning methods for CSI prediction. In wireless sensing systems, CSI can be leveraged to infer environmental changes, facilitating various functions, including gesture recognition and people identification. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant advantages over model-based approaches in these fine-grained CSI classification tasks, particularly when classes vary across different scenarios. However, a major challenge in training deep learning networks for wireless systems is the limited availability of data, further complicated by the diverse formats of many public datasets, which hinder integration. Additionally, collecting CSI data can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable time and manpower. To address these challenges, we propose CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, effectively utilizing limited data through a pre-training and fine-tuning approach. Building on CSI-BERT1, we enhance the model architecture by introducing an Adaptive Re-Weighting Layer (ARL) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to better capture sub-carrier and timestamp information, effectively addressing the permutation-invariance problem. Furthermore, we propose a Mask Prediction Model (MPM) fine-tuning method to improve the model's adaptability for CSI prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by reformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN execution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and network parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background information, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) instrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real radio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of SNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the Journal of IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</p></details> |
| **[Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Zero-Shot Table Understanding via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737v2)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we have developed a novel statistical technique based on signature transforms and have built a predictive and adaptive model to forecast these marketplace rates. Our technique is based on two key elements of the signature transform: one being its universal nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and hence translates the forecasting problem into linear regression, and the other being the signature kernel, which allows for comparing computationally efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon trucking operations, with far superior forecast accuracy and better interpretability versus commercially available industry models, even during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, our technique is able to capture the influence of business cycles and the heterogeneity of the marketplace, improving prediction accuracy by more than fivefold, with an estimated annualized saving of \$50MM.</p></details> |  |

Often, the goal is to infer the dynamic connections (or time-varying conditional dependencies) among multiple functions or time series. For this task, a dynamic and Bayesian functional graphical model is introduced. The proposed modeling approach prioritizes the careful definition of an appropriate graph to identify both time-invariant and time-varying connectivity patterns. A novel block-structured sparsity prior is paired with a finite basis expansion, which together yield effective shrinkage and graph selection with efficient computations via a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Crucially, the model includes (one or more) graph changepoints, which are learned jointly with all model parameters and incorporate graph dynamics. Simulation studies demonstrate excellent graph selection capabilities, with significant improvements over competing methods. The proposed approach is applied to study of dynamic connectivity patterns of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and reveals meaningful edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised for Computational Statistics and Data Analysis</p></details> |

However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin. In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%. The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.</p></details> |  |

While the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm performs dynamic smoothing based on local variation in a periodogram, the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm performs dynamic smoothing based on local departure from linearity in a periodogram. This article begins with a summary of the statistical foundations for both the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm and the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm, followed by instructions for accessing and utilizing these approaches within the R statistical program platform. Brief definitions, importance, statistical bases, theoretical and practical limits, and demonstrations are provided for their sensitivity, accuracy, resolution, and robustness in estimating signal frequencies. Next using a simulated time series in which two signals close in frequency are embedded in a significant level of random noise, the predictive power of these approaches are compared to the autoregressive integral moving average (ARIMA) approach, with support again garnered for their being robust when data is missing. Throughout, the article contrasts the limits of Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing to those of log-periodograms with static smoothing, while also comparing the performance of the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm to that of the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm. It concludes by delineating next steps to establish the precision with which Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing estimate signal strength.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 5 figures; updated title, expanded focus to dynamic smoothing with commensurate results, included comparisons to static smoothing limits</p></details> |

However, effectively capturing both the global sequence dependence and local detail features within time series data remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel generative self-supervised method called TimeDART, denoting Diffusion Auto-regressive Transformer for Time series forecasting. In TimeDART, we treat time series patches as basic modeling units. Specifically, we employ an self-attention based Transformer encoder to model the dependencies of inter-patches. Additionally, we introduce diffusion and denoising mechanisms to capture the detail locality features of intra-patch. Notably, we design a cross-attention-based denoising decoder that allows for adjustable optimization difficulty in the self-supervised task, facilitating more effective self-supervised pre-training. Furthermore, the entire model is optimized in an auto-regressive manner to obtain transferable representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeDART achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance compared to the most advanced competitive methods in forecasting tasks.

A similar storming occurred in Brazil in 2023. Although both attacks were instances in longer sequences of events, these have provided a testimony for many observers who had claimed that online actions, including the propagation of disinformation, have offline consequences. Soon after, a number of papers have been published about the relation between online disinformation and offline violence, among other related relations. Hitherto, the effects upon political protests have been unexplored. This paper thus evaluates such effects with a time series cross-sectional sample of 125 countries in a period between 2000 and 2019. The results are mixed. Based on Bayesian multi-level regression modeling, (i) there indeed is an effect between online disinformation and offline protests, but the effect is partially meditated by political polarization. The results are clearer in a sample of countries belonging to the European Economic Area. With this sample, (ii) offline protest counts increase from online disinformation disseminated by domestic governments, political parties, and politicians as well as by foreign governments. Furthermore, (iii) Internet shutdowns tend to decrease the counts, although, paradoxically, the absence of governmental online monitoring of social media tends to also decrease these. With these results, the paper contributes to the blossoming disinformation research by modeling the impact of disinformation upon offline phenomenon. The contribution is important due to the various policy measures planned or already enacted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Note ...</summary><p>Note that there is a divergence between this pre-print and the publisher's definite version available via the DOI.

Deep learning methods have become the mainstream research direction due to their excellent performance. However, new viewpoints have emerged in recent TSAD research. Deep learning is not required for TSAD due to limitations such as slow deep learning speed. The Broad Learning System (BLS) is a shallow network framework that benefits from its ease of optimization and speed. It has been shown to outperform machine learning approaches while remaining competitive with deep learning. Based on the current situation of TSAD, we propose the Contrastive Patch-based Broad Learning System (CPatchBLS). This is a new exploration of patching technique and BLS, providing a new perspective for TSAD. We construct Dual-PatchBLS as a base through patching and Simple Kernel Perturbation (SKP) and utilize contrastive learning to capture the differences between normal and abnormal data under different representations. To compensate for the temporal semantic loss caused by various patching, we propose CPatchBLS with model level integration, which takes advantage of BLS's fast feature to build model-level integration and improve model detection. Using five real-world series anomaly detection datasets, we confirmed the method's efficacy, outperforming previous deep learning and machine learning methods while retaining a high level of computing efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, Under review</p></details> |

While Transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies, their application to extended sequences is limited by computational inefficiencies and limited generalization. In this study, we propose KEDformer, a knowledge extraction-driven framework that integrates seasonal-trend decomposition to address these challenges. KEDformer leverages knowledge extraction methods that focus on the most informative weights within the self-attention mechanism to reduce computational overhead. Additionally, the proposed KEDformer framework decouples time series into seasonal and trend components. This decomposition enhances the model's ability to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term patterns. Extensive experiments on five public datasets from energy, transportation, and weather domains demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of KEDformer, providing an efficient solution for long-term time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, Journal paper</p></details> |

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Wavelet-based Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05244v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to best develop foundational models for time series forecasting remains an important open question. Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this effort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential input? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based tokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the space of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the input time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and finally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the forecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs, wavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting that simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark, including 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that WaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models for forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and performs on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically on each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities, achieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary metrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex temporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent pre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time series with varying frequencies evolving over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

Several post-hoc methods have emerged in recent years, but when applied to a given task, they produce different results, raising the question of which method is the most suitable to provide correct post-hoc interpretability. To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential. However, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks which hinders the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work, we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods in particular in time series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely dependence on human judgement, retraining, and shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We additionally design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity. The proposed methodology and quantitative metrics can be used to understand the reliability of interpretability methods results obtained in practical applications. In turn, they can be embedded within operational workflows in critical fields that require accurate interpretability results for e.g., regulatory policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version to match published version in Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing LRD in the spectral domain for functional time series in manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07731v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A statistical hypothesis test for long range dependence (LRD) in manifold-supported functional time series is formulated in the spectral domain. The proposed test statistic is based on the weighted periodogram operator, assuming that the elements of the spectral density operator family are invariant with respect to the group of isometries of the manifold. A Central Limit Theorem is derived to obtain the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the proposed test statistics operator under the null hypothesis. The rate of convergence to zero, in the Hilbert--Schmidt operator norm, of the bias of the integrated empirical second and fourth order cumulant spectral density operators is established under the alternative hypothesis. The consistency of the test is then derived, from the obtained consistency of the integrated weighted periodogram operator under LRD. Practical implementation of our testing approach is based on the random projection methodology. The frequency-varying Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion of invariant Gaussian random spectral Hilbert-Schmidt kernels on manifolds is considered for generation of random directions in the implementation of this methodology. A simulation study illustrates the main results regarding asymptotic normality and consistency, and the empirical size and power properties of the proposed testing approach.</p></details> | No comments |
| **[Assessing Similarity Measures for the Evaluation of Human-Robot Motion Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04820v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key area of research in Human-Robot Interaction is solving the human-robot correspondence problem, which asks how a robot can learn to reproduce a human motion demonstration when the human and robot have different dynamics and kinematic structures. Evaluating these correspondence problem solutions often requires the use of qualitative surveys that can be time consuming to design and administer. Additionally, qualitative survey results vary depending on the population of survey participants. In this paper, we propose the use of heterogeneous time-series similarity measures as a quantitative evaluation metric for evaluating motion correspondence to complement these qualitative surveys. To assess the suitability of these measures, we develop a behavioral cloning-based motion correspondence model, and evaluate it with a qualitative survey as well as quantitative measures. By comparing the resulting similarity scores with the human survey results, we identify Gromov Dynamic Time Warping as a promising quantitative measure for evaluating motion correspondence.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Time Series Forecasting with LLMs via Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04806v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) that are extensively trained on abundant text data, and customizing the input prompt to enable time series forecasting has received considerable attention. While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Radio Frequency Interference Detection with SNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06075v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) poses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, arising from terrestrial and celestial sources, disrupting observations conducted by radio telescopes. Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small twolayer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture. This study underscores the potential of RFI detection as a benchmark problem for SNN researchers, emphasizing the efficacy of SNNs in addressing complex time-series segmentation tasks in radio astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

| **[An Efficient Model Maintenance Approach for MLOps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04657v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, many industries have utilized machine learning models (ML) in their systems. Ideally, machine learning models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to data and concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up to date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource intensive, costly, time consuming, and model dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent retraining. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on four time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the performance of models while significantly reducing maintenance time and costs. Our model reuse approach achieves ML performance comparable to the best baseline, while being 15 times more efficient in terms of computation time and costs. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain the performance of their ML models in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 Pa...</summary><p>34 Pages, 25 Figures, 12 Tables, 1 Algorithm, Submitted to a journal</p></details> |

This paper presents a Toy-GS method for accurately rendering large-scale free camera trajectories. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial division approach for free trajectories to divide cameras and the sparse point cloud of the entire scene into various regions according to camera poses. Training each local Gaussian in parallel for each area enables us to concentrate on texture details and minimize GPU memory usage. Next, we use the multi-view constraint and position-aware point adaptive control (PPAC) to improve the rendering quality of texture details. In addition, our regional fusion approach combines local and global Gaussians to enhance rendering quality with an increasing number of divided areas. Extensive experiments have been carried out to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Toy-GS, leading to state-of-the-art results on two public large-scale datasets as well as our SCUTic dataset. Our proposal demonstrates an enhancement of 1.19 dB in PSNR and conserves 7 G of GPU memory when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of such agents is hindered by the lack of high-quality, multi-step trajectory data required for effective training. Existing approaches rely on expensive and labor-intensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. To address this challenge, we propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality GUI agent trajectories by leveraging web tutorials. Our method automatically gathers tutorial-like texts from the internet, transforms them into task goals with step-by-step instructions, and employs a visual-language model agent to simulate their execution in a real digital environment. A VLM-based evaluator ensures the correctness of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with these synthesized trajectories significantly improves their grounding and planning performance over the current models. Moreover, our approach is more cost-efficient compared to traditional human annotation methods. This work underscores the potential of guided replay with web tutorials as a viable strategy for large-scale GUI agent training, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

This study addresses this gap by introducing an online nonlinear programming trajectory optimization framework that integrates a differentiable energy model into autonomous systems. By leveraging traffic and slope profile predictions within a safety-critical framework, the proposed method enhances fuel efficiency for both sedans and diesel trucks by 3.71\% and 7.15\%, respectively, when compared to traditional model-agnostic quadratic programming techniques. These improvements translate to a potential \$6.14 billion economic benefit for the U.S. trucking industry. This work bridges the gap between model-agnostic autonomous driving and model-aware ECO-driving, highlighting a practical pathway for integrating energy efficiency into real-time trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Agnostic Visual Servoing considering kinematic constraints enabled by a decoupled network trajectory planner structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07017v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a visual servoing method consisting of a detection network and a velocity trajectory planner. First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, Mojito features a Directional Motion Control module that leverages cross-attention to efficiently direct the generated object's motion without additional training, alongside a Motion Intensity Modulator that uses optical flow maps generated from videos to guide varying levels of motion intensity. Extensive experiments demonstrate Mojito's effectiveness in achieving precise trajectory and intensity control with high computational efficiency, generating motion patterns that closely match specified directions and intensities, providing realistic dynamics that align well with natural motion in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</p></details> |  |

Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

It highlights the collaborative management of four-dimensional flight trajectories, serving as a common reference for decision-making among stakeholders, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), airspace users, and airport operators. Key enabling technologies such as Performance Based Navigation (PBN), data communications, and System-wide Information Management (SWIM) are discussed, showcasing their roles in rapid information exchange and trajectory optimization. A live flight case study demonstrates TBO concepts through international collaboration, indicating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and sustainability. The paper presents results from TBO prototype implementations, including enhanced trajectory accuracy, improved flight path efficiency, and real-time adjustments based on evolving conditions.

| **[Real-Time Trajectory Generation for Soft Robot Manipulators Using Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08568v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have the potential to interact with sensitive environments and perform complex tasks effectively. However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |

Each joint has limits in the ranges of position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions, this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach with simulations and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 pictures</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms.

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[POMDP-Based Trajectory Planning for On-Ramp Highway Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07567v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for automated vehicle on-ramp highway merging. To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally, we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle, combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various automated driving problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[When UAV Meets Federated Learning: Latency Minimization via Joint Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07428v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal solution for training machine learning models over wireless networks, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation resources. Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Control-Aware Trajectory Predictions for Communication-Efficient Drone Swarm Coordination in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12852v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have demonstrated enormous potential in many industrial and commercial applications. However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model predictive control-based trajectory generation for agile landing of unmanned aerial vehicle on a moving boat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07332v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel trajectory generation method based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for agile landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) onto an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)'s deck in harsh conditions. The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 17 figures, Ocean Engineering</p></details> |
| **[PPT: Pre-Training with Pseudo-Labeled Trajectories for Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06491v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting (MF) for autonomous driving aims at anticipating trajectories of surrounding agents in complex urban scenarios. In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

While existing 3D editing methods excel at modifying color, texture, and style, they struggle with extensive geometric or appearance changes, thus limiting their applications. We propose Perturb-and-Revise, which makes possible a variety of NeRF editing. First, we perturb the NeRF parameters with random initializations to create a versatile initialization. We automatically determine the perturbation magnitude through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Perturb-and-Revise facilitates flexible, effective, and consistent editing of color, appearance, and geometry in 3D.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong performances in comparison to state of-the-art methods on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04184v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.</p></details> | 16 |

The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[Abstraction-based Control of Unknown Continuous-Space Models with Just Two Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03892v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) offer an effective scheme for approximating the complex continuous-space systems with simpler models in the discrete-space domain. A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal relation between the original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a discrete controller designed for the symbolic model can be effectively implemented as a hybrid controller (using an interface map) for the original system. This task becomes even more challenging when the exact mathematical model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To address this, the existing literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven methods, which require collecting a large amount of data from the original system. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state trajectories collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a hybrid controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the concept of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness between the state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven symbolic model. By satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data, which intuitively ensures that the unknown system is persistently excited, we directly design an ASF and its corresponding hybrid controller using finite-length data without explicitly identifying the unknown system, while providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach through a case study.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03195v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference Research (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[TGS: Trajectory Generation and Selection using Vision Language Models in Mapless Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02454v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-modal trajectory generation and selection algorithm for real-world mapless outdoor navigation in human-centered environments. Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Trajectory Classification and Landmark Inference on Simplicial Complexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03145v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of classifying trajectories on a discrete or discretised 2-dimensional manifold modelled by a simplicial complex. Previous works have proposed to project the trajectories into the harmonic eigenspace of the Hodge Laplacian, and then cluster the resulting embeddings. However, if the considered space has vanishing homology (i.e., no "holes"), then the harmonic space of the 1-Hodge Laplacian is trivial and thus the approach fails. Here we propose to view this issue akin to a sensor placement problem and present an algorithm that aims to learn "optimal holes" to distinguish a set of given trajectory classes. Specifically, given a set of labelled trajectories, which we interpret as edge-flows on the underlying simplicial complex, we search for 2-simplices whose deletion results in an optimal separation of the trajectory labels according to the corresponding spectral embedding of the trajectories into the harmonic space. Finally, we generalise this approach to the unsupervised setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at the 58th Annual Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2024</p></details> |
| **[Social-Transmotion: Promptable Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16168v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-transmotion.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

Traditionally, this task relies on sequence modeling and behavior analysis techniques applied to tabular or video-based data, but these methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture partial matching. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pairwise spatiotemporal partial trajectory matching that transforms tabular spatiotemporal data into interpretable trajectory images based on specified time windows, allowing for partial trajectory analysis. This approach includes localization of trajectories, checking for spatial overlap, and pairwise matching using a Siamese Neural Network. We evaluate our method on a co-walking classification task, demonstrating its effectiveness in a novel co-behavior identification application. Our model surpasses established methods, achieving an F1-score up to 0.73. Additionally, we explore the method's utility for pair routine pattern analysis in real-world scenarios, providing insights into the frequency, timing, and duration of shared behaviors. This approach offers a powerful, interpretable framework for spatiotemporal behavior analysis, with potential applications in social behavior research, urban planning, and healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission. 17 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

Despite researchers' efforts, it remains a challenge to accurately account for social interactions among agents when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate such social modifications to future trajectories in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by the resonance phenomenon of vibration systems, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to forecast pedestrian trajectories as co-vibrations, and regard that social interactions are associated with spectral properties of agents' trajectories. It forecasts future trajectories as three distinct vibration terms to represent agents' future plans from different perspectives in a decoupled way. Also, agents' social interactions and how they modify scheduled trajectories will be considered in a resonance-like manner by learning the similarities of their trajectory spectrums. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrian or vehicle, have verified the usefulness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

The complex interactions brought by different relations between agents are a crucial reason that poses challenges to this task. Researchers have put much effort into designing a system using rule-based or data-based models to extract and validate the patterns between pedestrian trajectories and these interactions, which has not been adequately addressed yet. Inspired by how humans perceive social interactions with different level of relations to themself, this work proposes the GrouP ConCeption (short for GPCC) model composed of the Group method, which categorizes nearby agents into either group members or non-group members based on a long-term distance kernel function, and the Conception module, which perceives both visual and acoustic information surrounding the target agent. Evaluated across multiple datasets, the GPCC model demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory prediction accuracy, validating its effectiveness in modeling both social and individual dynamics. The qualitative analysis also indicates that the GPCC framework successfully leverages grouping and perception cues human-like intuitively to validate the proposed model's explainability in pedestrian trajectory forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, submitted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-based Road Autolabeling with Lidar-Camera Fusion in Winter Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02370v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust road segmentation in all road conditions is required for safe autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v3)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Latent Goal by Learning from Trajectory Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02125v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A glowing body of work has emerged focusing on instruction-following policies for open-world agents, aiming to better align the agent's behavior with human intentions. However, the performance of these policies is highly susceptible to the initial prompt, which leads to extra efforts in selecting the best instructions. We propose a framework named Preference Goal Tuning (PGT). PGT allows an instruction following policy to interact with the environment to collect several trajectories, which will be categorized into positive and negative samples based on preference. Then we use preference learning to fine-tune the initial goal latent representation with the categorized trajectories while keeping the policy backbone frozen. The experiment result shows that with minimal data and training, PGT achieves an average relative improvement of 72.0% and 81.6% over 17 tasks in 2 different foundation policies respectively, and outperforms the best human-selected instructions. Moreover, PGT surpasses full fine-tuning in the out-of-distribution (OOD) task-execution environments by 13.4%, indicating that our approach retains strong generalization capabilities. Since our approach stores a single latent representation for each task independently, it can be viewed as an efficient method for continual learning, without the risk of catastrophic forgetting or task interference. In short, PGT enhances the performance of agents across nearly all tasks in the Minecraft Skillforge benchmark and demonstrates robustness to the execution environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Another Vertical View: A Hierarchical Network for Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction via Spectrums](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05106v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the fast development of AI-related techniques, the applications of trajectory prediction are no longer limited to easier scenes and trajectories. More and more trajectories with different forms, such as coordinates, bounding boxes, and even high-dimensional human skeletons, need to be analyzed and forecasted. Among these heterogeneous trajectories, interactions between different elements within a frame of trajectory, which we call ``Dimension-wise Interactions'', would be more complex and challenging. However, most previous approaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, and potential dimension-wise interactions are less concerned. In this work, we expand the trajectory prediction task by introducing the trajectory dimensionality $M$, thus extending its application scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories. We first introduce the Haar transform as an alternative to Fourier transform to better capture the time-frequency properties of each trajectory-dimension. Then, we adopt the bilinear structure to model and fuse two factors simultaneously, including the time-frequency response and the dimension-wise interaction, to forecast heterogeneous trajectories via trajectory spectrums hierarchically in a generic way. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on ETH-UCY, SDD, nuScenes, and Human3.6M with heterogeneous trajectories, including 2D coordinates, 2D/3D bounding boxes, and 3D human skeletons.</p></details> |  |

The reconnaissance phase is a low-altitude flyby to collect detailed information around a potential landing site. Although such autonomous deep-space exploration missions have garnered considerable interest recently, state-of-the-practice in trajectory design involves a time-intensive ground-based open-loop process that forward propagates multiple trajectories with a range of initial conditions and parameters to account for uncertainties in spacecraft knowledge and actuation. In this work, we introduce a stochastic trajectory optimization-based approach to generate trajectories that satisfy both the mission and spacecraft safety constraints during the reconnaissance phase of the Deep-space Autonomous Robotic Explorer (DARE) mission concept, which seeks to travel to and explore a near-Earth object autonomously, with minimal ground intervention. We first use the Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT) simulation framework to rigorously validate the underlying modeling assumptions for our trajectory planner and then propose a method to transform this stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic one tailored for use with an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithmic approach through extensive numerical experiments and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-practice benchmark used for representative missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for 2025 AIAA SciTech Forum (also selected a finalist for the 2025 GNC Graduate Student Paper Competition)</p></details> |

While existing methods excel at novel view synthesis on recorded trajectories, they face challenges with novel trajectories due to limited views of driving videos and the vastness of driving environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel free-form driving view synthesis approach, dubbed DriveX, by leveraging video generative prior to optimize a 3D model across a variety of trajectories. Concretely, we crafted an inverse problem that enables a video diffusion model to be utilized as a prior for many-trajectory optimization of a parametric 3D model (e.g., Gaussian splatting). To seamlessly use the generative prior, we iteratively conduct this process during optimization. Our resulting model can produce high-fidelity virtual driving environments outside the recorded trajectory, enabling free-form trajectory driving simulation. Beyond real driving scenes, DriveX can also be utilized to simulate virtual driving worlds from AI-generated videos.</p></details> |  |

When the researchers use NS-2 to simulate a single anchor-assisted localization model, they face the problem of creating the movement file of the movable anchor. The proposed framework solved this problem by allowing them to create the movement scenario regarding different trajectories. The proposed framework lets the researcher set the needed parameters for simulating various static path models, which can be displayed through the graphical user interface. The researcher can also view the mobility of the movable anchor with control of its speed and communication range. The proposed framework has been validated by comparing its results to NS-2 outputs plus comparing it against existing tools. Finally, this framework has been published on the Code Project website and downloaded by many users.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW), which transcribes the trajectory optimization into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity in each itera-tion to achieve fast trajectory generation. Through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, the customized trajectory representation is presented, which implies the equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and deduction of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into an uncon-strained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time com-plexity to further improve efficiency. The simulation experi-ments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in ran-domly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems; Recived Reject with major revision and encouragement to resubmit (31-Oct-2024)</p></details> |

GPS trajectory data offers valuable information for ETA, but challenges arise due to temporal sparsity, variable sequence lengths, and the interdependencies among multiple trucks. To address these issues, we propose the Temporal-Attribute-Spatial Tri-space Coordination (TAS-TsC) framework, which leverages three feature spaces-temporal, attribute, and spatial-to enhance ETA. Our framework consists of a Temporal Learning Module (TLM) using state space models to capture temporal dependencies, an Attribute Extraction Module (AEM) that transforms sequential features into structured attribute embeddings, and a Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) that models the interactions among multiple trajectories using graph representation learning.These modules collaboratively learn trajectory embeddings, which are then used by a Downstream Prediction Module (DPM) to estimate arrival times. We validate TAS-TsC on real truck trajectory datasets collected from Shenzhen, China, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BIGCity: A Universal Spatiotemporal Model for Unified Trajectory and Traffic State Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00953v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical dynamic ST data includes trajectory data (representing individual-level mobility) and traffic state data (representing population-level mobility). Traditional studies often treat trajectory and traffic state data as distinct, independent modalities, each tailored to specific tasks within a single modality. However, real-world applications, such as navigation apps, require joint analysis of trajectory and traffic state data. Treating these data types as two separate domains can lead to suboptimal model performance. Although recent advances in ST data pre-training and ST foundation models aim to develop universal models for ST data analysis, most existing models are "multi-task, solo-data modality" (MTSM), meaning they can handle multiple tasks within either trajectory data or traffic state data, but not both simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper introduces BIGCity, the first multi-task, multi-data modality (MTMD) model for ST data analysis. The model targets two key challenges in designing an MTMD ST model: (1) unifying the representations of different ST data modalities, and (2) unifying heterogeneous ST analysis tasks. To overcome the first challenge, BIGCity introduces a novel ST-unit that represents both trajectories and traffic states in a unified format. Additionally, for the second challenge, BIGCity adopts a tunable large model with ST task-oriented prompt, enabling it to perform a range of heterogeneous tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BIGCity achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 tasks, outperforming 18 baselines. To the best of our knowledge, BIGCity is the first model capable of handling both trajectories and traffic states for diverse heterogeneous tasks.

Local differential privacy (LDP) provides provable privacy guarantees for users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory collection methods ensure LDP only for discrete location spaces, where the number of locations affects their privacy guarantees and trajectory utility. Moreover, the location space is often naturally continuous, such as in flying and sailing trajectories, making these methods unsuitable. This paper proposes two trajectory collection methods that ensure LDP for continuous spaces: TraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C, which perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are theoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility. TraCS can also be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the nearest discrete points. It is independent of the number of locations and has only $\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation results on discrete location spaces validate this advantage and show that TraCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility, especially for large privacy parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VLDB 2025</p></details> |

However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments.

| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |

This study aims to address these challenges by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 fig...</summary><p>7 figures, 3 tables, 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Barrier-Enhanced Parallel Homotopic Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10441v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Attention for Fine-grained Video Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19324v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have been greatly driven by video diffusion models, with camera motion control emerging as a crucial challenge in creating view-customized visual content. This paper introduces trajectory attention, a novel approach that performs attention along available pixel trajectories for fine-grained camera motion control. Unlike existing methods that often yield imprecise outputs or neglect temporal correlations, our approach possesses a stronger inductive bias that seamlessly injects trajectory information into the video generation process. Importantly, our approach models trajectory attention as an auxiliary branch alongside traditional temporal attention. This design enables the original temporal attention and the trajectory attention to work in synergy, ensuring both precise motion control and new content generation capability, which is critical when the trajectory is only partially available. Experiments on camera motion control for images and videos demonstrate significant improvements in precision and long-range consistency while maintaining high-quality generation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be extended to other video motion control tasks, such as first-frame-guided video editing, where it excels in maintaining content consistency over large spatial and temporal ranges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: xizaoqu.github.io/trajattn/</p></details> |
| **[Computationally efficient trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states. These results indicate that TEA captures critical, environment-specific characteristics, enabling RL agents to generalize effectively across dynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RED: Effective Trajectory Representation Learning with Comprehensive Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15096v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can then be used for various downstream tasks, including trajectory similarity computation, trajectory classification, and travel-time estimation. However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by VLDB2025</p></details> |
| **[Synergizing Decision Making and Trajectory Planning Using Two-Stage Optimization for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18974v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a local planner that synergizes the decision making and trajectory planning modules towards autonomous driving. The decision making and trajectory planning tasks are jointly formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with an integrated objective function. However, integrating the discrete decision variables into the continuous trajectory optimization leads to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with inherent nonlinearity and nonconvexity. To address the challenge in solving the problem, the original problem is decomposed into two sub-stages, and a two-stage optimization (TSO) based approach is presented to ensure the coherence in outcomes for the two stages. The optimization problem in the first stage determines the optimal decision sequence that acts as an informed initialization. With the outputs from the first stage, the second stage necessitates the use of a high-fidelity vehicle model and strict enforcement of the collision avoidance constraints as part of the trajectory planning problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed planner across diverse multi-lane scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner simultaneously generates a sequence of optimal decisions and the corresponding trajectory that significantly improves driving performance in terms of driving safety and traveling efficiency as compared to alternative methods. Additionally, we implement the closed-loop simulation in CARLA, and the results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed planner to adapt to changing driving situations with high computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory-planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/hslyu/dbspf.{https://github.com/hslyu/dbspf}.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of dissection trajectories is crucial for better decision-making, reducing intraoperative errors, and improving surgical training. Nevertheless, predicting these trajectories is challenging due to variable tumor margins and dynamic visual conditions. To address this issue, we create the ESD Trajectory and Confidence Map-based Safety Margin (ETSM) dataset with $1849$ short clips, focusing on submucosal dissection with a dual-arm robotic system. We also introduce a framework that combines optimal dissection trajectory prediction with a confidence map-based safety margin, providing a more secure and intelligent decision-making tool to minimize surgical risks for ESD procedures. Additionally, we propose the Regression-based Confidence Map Prediction Network (RCMNet), which utilizes a regression approach to predict confidence maps for dissection areas, thereby delineating various levels of safety margins. We evaluate our RCMNet using three distinct experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, robustness assessment, and out-of-domain evaluation. Experimental results show that our approach excels in the confidence map-based safety margin prediction task, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of only $3.18$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a regression approach for visual guidance concerning delineating varying safety levels of dissection areas. Our approach bridges gaps in current research by improving prediction accuracy and enhancing the safety of the dissection process, showing great clinical significance in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v3)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories, with their detailed geolocations, are a promising data source to compute traffic flow maps which facilitate the understanding of traffic flows at scales ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The trade-off is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial obstacles for small-scale aggregation. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We then deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases--self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data--to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant in tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, significantly reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</p></details> |  |
| **[QP Chaser: Polynomial Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14273v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining the visibility of the target is one of the major objectives of aerial tracking missions. This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming (QP). Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including 1) single- and dual-target following and 2) both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the target's center, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable sets of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path topology, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable set among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This has fueled interest in developing intuitive tools that let users leverage video generation as world simulators. Text-to-video (T2V) generation is one such approach, enabling video creation from text descriptions only. Yet, due to the inherent ambiguity in texts and the limited temporal information offered by text prompts, researchers have explored additional control signals like trajectory-guided systems, for more accurate T2V generation. Nonetheless, methods to evaluate whether T2V models can generate realistic interactions between multiple objects are lacking. We introduce InTraGen, a pipeline for improved trajectory-based generation of object interaction scenarios. We propose 4 new datasets and a novel trajectory quality metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed InTraGen. To achieve object interaction, we introduce a multi-modal interaction encoding pipeline with an object ID injection mechanism that enriches object-environment interactions. Our results demonstrate improvements in both visual fidelity and quantitative performance. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/insait-institute/InTraGen</p></details> |  |

A parameter adaptive control framework for AVs is proposed to enhance tracking accuracy and yaw stability. While establishing linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and three robust controllers, the control framework addresses trajectory tracking and motion control in a modular fashion, without introducing complexity into each controller. The robust performance has been guaranteed in three robust controllers by considering the parameter uncertainties, mismatch of unmodeled subsystem as well as external disturbance, comprehensively. Also, the dynamic characteristics of uncertain parameters are identified by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, while the boundaries of three robust factors are determined through combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian optimization machine learning methods, reducing the conservatism of the controller. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse robust factors are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically. The simulation results on MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim joint platform demonstrate that the proposed methodology considerably improves tracking accuracy, driving stability, and robust performance, guaranteeing the feasibility and capability of driving in extreme scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which discretizes one variable of the AGHF PDE, and converts the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which is computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim5$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.

Although deep learning-based approaches - especially those utilizing transformer-based and generative models - have markedly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions, they frequently overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions critical for real-world driving applications, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. To address the issue, this study introduces a scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction, which integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a generative framework, improving both the accuracy and plausibility of predicted trajectories. The model utilizes a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle dynamics by scaling noise with encoded historical features within the diffusion process. Particularly, it employs a cross-attention-based transformer architecture to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.11941</p></details> |

The challenge lies in the exponentially growing search space as the number of tables increases, making exhaustive enumeration impractical. Traditional optimizers use static heuristics to prune the search space, but they often fail to adapt to changes or improve based on feedback from the DBMS. Recent research addresses these limitations with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), allowing models to use feedback to dynamically search for better join orders and enhance performance over time. Existing research primarily focuses on capturing join order sequences and their representations at various levels, with limited comparative analysis of reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we propose GTDD, a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Treestructured Long Short-Term Memory (Tree LSTM), and DuelingDQN. We conduct a series of experiments that demonstrate a clear advantage of GTDD over state-of the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

Recently, some studies utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the graph representation of code in vulnerability detection tasks have achieved remarkable success. However, existing graph-based approaches mainly face two limitations that prevent them from generalizing well to large code graphs: (1) the interference of noise information in the code graph; (2) the difficulty in capturing long-distance dependencies within the graph. To mitigate these problems, we propose a novel vulnerability detection method, ANGLE, whose novelty mainly embodies the hierarchical graph refinement and context-aware graph representation learning. The former hierarchically filters redundant information in the code graph, thereby reducing the size of the graph, while the latter collaboratively employs the Graph Transformer and GNN to learn code graph representations from both the global and local perspectives, thus capturing long-distance dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate promising results on three widely used benchmark datasets: our method significantly outperforms several other baselines in terms of the accuracy and F1 score. Particularly, in large code graphs, ANGLE achieves an improvement in accuracy of 34.27%-161.93% compared to the state-of-the-art method, AMPLE. Such results demonstrate the effectiveness of ANGLE in vulnerability detection tasks.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Can LLMs Convert Graphs to Text-Attributed Graphs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10136v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous data structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to learn node embeddings through message passing on these structures. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to multiple graphs with different feature spaces, as existing GNN architectures are not designed for cross-graph feature alignment. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs, where each node is associated with a textual description, enabling the use of a shared textual encoder to project nodes from different graphs into a unified feature space. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed data, which can be difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information with each node's properties, enhancing the LLMs' ability to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating that it enables a single GNN to operate across diverse graphs. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data, even in the absence of textual information. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/TANS.</p></details> |  |

Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message-passing) layers, within which the representation of each node is updated based on those of its neighbors. The most expressive message-passing GNNs can be obtained through the use of the sum aggregator and of MLPs for feature transformation, thanks to their universal approximation capabilities. However, the limitations of MLPs recently motivated the introduction of another family of universal approximators, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) which rely on a different representation theorem. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs on graph learning tasks. We evaluate two different implementations of KANs using two distinct base families of functions, namely B-splines and radial basis functions. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our results indicate that KANs are on-par with or better than MLPs on all studied tasks, making them viable alternatives, at the cost of some computational complexity.

Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) stand out as the mainstream solution in this task. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of remarkable dynamic spatial modeling-based STGNNs has become the bottleneck over large-scale traffic data. From the spatial data management perspective, we present a novel Transformer framework called PatchSTG to efficiently and dynamically model spatial dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting with interpretability and fidelity. Specifically, we design a novel irregular spatial patching to reduce the number of points involved in the dynamic calculation of Transformer. The irregular spatial patching first utilizes the leaf K-dimensional tree (KDTree) to recursively partition irregularly distributed traffic points into leaf nodes with a small capacity, and then merges leaf nodes belonging to the same subtree into occupancy-equaled and non-overlapped patches through padding and backtracking. Based on the patched data, depth and breadth attention are used interchangeably in the encoder to dynamically learn local and global spatial knowledge from points in a patch and points with the same index of patches. Experimental results on four real world large-scale traffic datasets show that our PatchSTG achieves train speed and memory utilization improvements up to $10\times$ and $4\times$ with the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

In GSC, graph edit distance (GED) and maximum common subgraph (MCS) are two important similarity metrics, both of which are NP-hard to compute. Instead of calculating the exact values, recent solutions resort to leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn data-driven models for the estimation of GED and MCS. Most of them are built on components involving node-level interactions crossing graphs, which engender vast computation overhead but are of little avail in effectiveness. In the paper, we present GraSP, a simple yet effective GSC approach for GED and MCS prediction. GraSP achieves high result efficacy through several key instruments: enhanced node features via positional encoding and a GNN model augmented by a gating mechanism, residual connections, as well as multi-scale pooling. Theoretically, GraSP can surpass the 1-WL test, indicating its high expressiveness. Empirically, extensive experiments comparing GraSP against 10 competitors on multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets showcase the superiority of GraSP over prior arts in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

| **[Towards Fair Graph Neural Networks via Graph Counterfactual without Sensitive Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09947v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in today's connected world, driving extensive research in graph analysis. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great success in this field, leading to growing interest in developing fair GNNs for critical applications. However, most existing fair GNNs focus on statistical fairness notions, which may be insufficient when dealing with statistical anomalies. Hence, motivated by causal theory, there has been growing attention to mitigating root causes of unfairness utilizing graph counterfactuals. Unfortunately, existing methods for generating graph counterfactuals invariably require the sensitive attribute. Nevertheless, in many real-world applications, it is usually infeasible to obtain sensitive attributes due to privacy or legal issues, which challenge existing methods. In this paper, we propose a framework named Fairwos (improving Fairness without sensitive attributes). In particular, we first propose a mechanism to generate pseudo-sensitive attributes to remedy the problem of missing sensitive attributes, and then design a strategy for finding graph counterfactuals from the real dataset. To train fair GNNs, we propose a method to ensure that the embeddings from the original data are consistent with those from the graph counterfactuals, and dynamically adjust the weight of each pseudo-sensitive attribute to balance its contribution to fairness and utility. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that minimizing the relation between these pseudo-sensitive attributes and the prediction can enable the fairness of GNNs. Experimental results on six real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing utility and fairness.</p></details> | ICDE 2025 |

Nevertheless, the structure incompleteness, noise, and redundancy result in poor robustness for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs). Dynamic Graph Structure Learning (DGSL) offers a promising way to optimize graph structures. However, aside from encountering unacceptable quadratic complexity, it overly relies on heuristic priors, making it hard to discover underlying predictive patterns. How to efficiently refine the dynamic structures, capture intrinsic dependencies, and learn robust representations, remains under-explored. In this work, we propose the novel DG-Mamba, a robust and efficient Dynamic Graph structure learning framework with the Selective State Space Models (Mamba). To accelerate the spatio-temporal structure learning, we propose a kernelized dynamic message-passing operator that reduces the quadratic time complexity to linear. To capture global intrinsic dynamics, we establish the dynamic graph as a self-contained system with State Space Model. By discretizing the system states with the cross-snapshot graph adjacency, we enable the long-distance dependencies capturing with the selective snapshot scan. To endow learned dynamic structures more expressive with informativeness, we propose the self-supervised Principle of Relevant Information for DGSL to regularize the most relevant yet least redundant information, enhancing global robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the robustness and efficiency of our DG-Mamba compared with the state-of-the-art baselines against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Bootstrapping Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning via Large Language Models: A Generalized Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08038v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Brain-inspired Chaotic Graph Backpropagation for Large-scale Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09860v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) with unsupervised learning can solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with efficient time complexity, making them versatile for various applications. However, since this method maps the combinatorial optimization problem to the training process of a graph neural network, and the current mainstream backpropagation-based training algorithms are prone to fall into local minima, the optimization performance is still inferior to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) COP methods. To address this issue, inspired by possibly chaotic dynamics of real brain learning, we introduce a chaotic training algorithm, i.e. chaotic graph backpropagation (CGBP), which introduces a local loss function in GNN that makes the training process not only chaotic but also highly efficient. Different from existing methods, we show that the global ergodicity and pseudo-randomness of such chaotic dynamics enable CGBP to learn each optimal GNN effectively and globally, thus solving the COP efficiently. We have applied CGBP to solve various COPs, such as the maximum independent set, maximum cut, and graph coloring. Results on several large-scale benchmark datasets showcase that CGBP can outperform not only existing GNN algorithms but also SOTA methods. In addition to solving large-scale COPs, CGBP as a universal learning algorithm for GNNs, i.e. as a plug-in unit, can be easily integrated into any existing method for improving the performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Scalable Estimation of Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03350v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for node and graph representation learning tasks, the reliability of GNN uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts remains relatively under-explored. Indeed, while post-hoc calibration strategies can be used to improve in-distribution calibration, they need not also improve calibration under distribution shift. However, techniques which produce GNNs with better intrinsic uncertainty estimates are particularly valuable, as they can always be combined with post-hoc strategies later. Therefore, in this work, we propose G-$\Delta$UQ, a novel training framework designed to improve intrinsic GNN uncertainty estimates. Our framework adapts the principle of stochastic data centering to graph data through novel graph anchoring strategies, and is able to support partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic networks are necessary to obtain reliable estimates, we find that the functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\Delta$UQ on pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate, concept and graph size shifts, we show that G-$\Delta$UQ leads to better calibrated GNNs for node and graph classification. Further, it also improves performance on the uncertainty-based tasks of out-of-distribution detection and generalization gap estimation. Overall, our work provides insights into uncertainty estimation for GNNs, and demonstrates the utility of G-$\Delta$UQ in obtaining reliable estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2024; Project page: https://pujacomputes.github.io/gduq/</p></details> |

However, their application is often hindered by the varyinghomophily levels across different orders of neighboring nodes, ne-cessitating separate model designs for homophilic and heterophilicgraphs. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified framework ca-pable of handling neighborhoods of various orders and homophilylevels. Through theoretical exploration, we identify a previouslyoverlooked architectural aspect in multi-hop learning: the cascadedependency, which leads to asmoothness-generalization dilemma.This dilemma significantly affects the learning process, especiallyin the context of high-order neighborhoods and heterophilic graphs.To resolve this issue, we propose an Inceptive Graph Neural Net-work (IGNN), a universal message-passing framework that replacesthe cascade dependency with an inceptive architecture. IGNN pro-vides independent representations for each hop, allowing personal-ized generalization capabilities, and captures neighborhood-wiserelationships to select appropriate receptive fields. Extensive ex-periments show that our IGNN outperforms 23 baseline methods,demonstrating superior performance on both homophilic and het-erophilic graphs, while also scaling efficiently to large graphs.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI Workshop Paper (MALTA)</p></details> |

Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly reduce its impact. While histopathology examinations play a vital role in rapid and accurate diagnosis, they often require experienced medical experts for proper recognition and cancer grading. Automated image retrieval systems have the potential to assist pathologists in identifying cancerous tissues, thereby accelerating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless, proposing an accurate image retrieval model is challenging due to considerable variability among the tissue and cell patterns in histological images. In this work, we leverage the features from foundation models in a novel attention-based adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder model for breast histological image retrieval. Our results confirm the superior performance of models trained with foundation model features compared to those using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (up to 7.7% and 15.5% for mAP and mMV, respectively), with the pre-trained general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) delivering the best overall performance. By evaluating two publicly available histology image datasets of breast cancer, our top-performing model, trained with UNI features, achieved average mAP/mMV scores of 96.7%/91.5% and 97.6%/94.2% for the BreakHis and BACH datasets, respectively. Our proposed retrieval model has the potential to be used in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic performance and ultimately benefit patients.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Search Strategy Generation for Branch and Bound Using Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09444v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) is an exact method in integer programming that recursively divides the search space into a tree. During the resolution process, determining the next subproblem to explore within the tree-known as the search strategy-is crucial. Hand-crafted heuristics are commonly used, but none are effective over all problem classes. Recent approaches utilizing neural networks claim to make more intelligent decisions but are computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce GP2S (Genetic Programming for Search Strategy), a novel machine learning approach that automatically generates a B\&B search strategy heuristic, aiming to make intelligent decisions while being computationally lightweight. We define a policy as a function that evaluates the quality of a B\&B node by combining features from the node and the problem; the search strategy policy is then defined by a best-first search based on this node ranking. The policy space is explored using a genetic programming algorithm, and the policy that achieves the best performance on a training set is selected. We compare our approach with the standard method of the SCIP solver, a recent graph neural network-based method, and handcrafted heuristics. Our first evaluation includes three types of primal hard problems, tested on instances similar to the training set and on larger instances. Our method is at most 2\% slower than the best baseline and consistently outperforms SCIP, achieving an average speedup of 11.3\%. Additionally, GP2S is tested on the MIPLIB 2017 dataset, generating multiple heuristics from different subsets of instances. It exceeds SCIP's average performance in 7 out of 10 cases across 15 times more instances and under a time limit 15 times longer, with some GP2S methods leading on most experiments in terms of the number of feasible solutions or optimality gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</p></details> |  |

The issue, however, is that as the individual graph scales and/ or GNN architecture becomes increasingly complex, the increased energy budget of the overall deep learning model makes it unsustainable and restricts its applications in applications like edge computing. To overcome this, we propose in this paper Hybrid Variable Spiking Graph Neural Networks (HVS-GNNs) that utilize Variable Spiking Neurons (VSNs) within their architecture to promote sparse communication and hence reduce the overall energy budget. VSNs, while promoting sparse event-driven computations, also perform well for regression tasks, which are often encountered in computational mechanics applications and are the main target of this paper. Three examples dealing with prediction of mechanical properties of material based on microscale/ mesoscale structures are shown to test the performance of the proposed HVS-GNNs in regression tasks. We have also compared the performance of HVS-GNN architectures with the performance of vanilla GNNs and GNNs utilizing leaky integrate and fire neurons. The results produced show that HVS-GNNs perform well for regression tasks, all while promoting sparse communication and, hence, energy efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Detection on Social Media with Temporal Propagation Structure Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08316v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for detecting rumors on social media primarily focus on analyzing textual content, often struggling to capture the complexity of online interactions. Recent research has shifted towards leveraging graph neural networks to model the hierarchical conversation structure that emerges during rumor propagation. However, these methods tend to overlook the temporal aspect of rumor propagation and may disregard potential noise within the propagation structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates temporal information by constructing a weighted propagation tree, where the weight of each edge represents the time interval between connected posts. Drawing upon the theory of structural entropy, we transform this tree into a coding tree. This transformation aims to preserve the essential structure of rumor propagation while reducing noise. Finally, we introduce a recursive neural network to learn from the coding tree for rumor veracity prediction. Experimental results on two common datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | COLING'25 |

However, current research on text-attributed graph learning predominantly focuses on homogeneous graphs, which feature a single node and edge type, thus leaving a gap in understanding how methods perform on HTAGs. One crucial reason is the lack of comprehensive HTAG datasets that offer original textual content and span multiple domains of varying sizes. To this end, we introduce a collection of challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for realistic and reproducible evaluation of machine learning models on HTAGs. Our HTAG datasets are multi-scale, span years in duration, and cover a wide range of domains, including movie, community question answering, academic, literature, and patent networks. We further conduct benchmark experiments on these datasets with various graph neural networks. All source data, dataset construction codes, processed HTAGs, data loaders, benchmark codes, and evaluation setup are publicly available at GitHub and Hugging Face.</p></details> |  |

However, SGNN models suffer from poor explainability, which limit their adoptions in critical scenarios that require understanding the rationale behind predictions. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no research work on the explainability of the SGNN models. Our goal is to address the explainability of decision-making for the downstream task of link sign prediction specific to signed graph neural networks. Since post-hoc explanations are not derived directly from the models, they may be biased and misrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a Self-Explainable Signed Graph transformer (SE-SGformer) framework, which can not only outputs explainable information while ensuring high prediction accuracy. Specifically, We propose a new Transformer architecture for signed graphs and theoretically demonstrate that using positional encoding based on signed random walks has greater expressive power than current SGNN methods and other positional encoding graph Transformer-based approaches. We constructs a novel explainable decision process by discovering the $K$-nearest (farthest) positive (negative) neighbors of a node to replace the neural network-based decoder for predicting edge signs. These $K$ positive (negative) neighbors represent crucial information about the formation of positive (negative) edges between nodes and thus can serve as important explanatory information in the decision-making process. We conducted experiments on several real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of SE-SGformer, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by improving 2.2\% prediction accuracy and 73.1\% explainablity accuracy in the best-case scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

We design the Grothendieck Graph Neural Networks (GGNN) framework, offering an algebraic platform for creating and refining diverse covers for graphs. This framework translates covers into matrix forms, such as the adjacency matrix, expanding the scope of designing GNN models based on desired message-passing strategies. Leveraging algebraic tools, GGNN facilitates the creation of models that outperform traditional approaches. Based on the GGNN framework, we propose Sieve Neural Networks (SNN), a new GNN model that leverages the notion of sieves from category theory. SNN demonstrates outstanding performance in experiments, particularly on benchmarks designed to test the expressivity of GNNs, and exemplifies the versatility of GGNN in generating novel architectures.</p></details> |  |

Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

This research presents a novel method that provides social recommendations by incorporating the dynamic property of social network data in a heterogeneous graph. The model aims to capture user preference over time without going through the complexities of a dynamic graph by adding period nodes to define users' long-term and short-term preferences and aggregating assigned edge weights. The model is applied to real-world data to argue its superior performance. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study GNN robustness to label noise, demonstrate GNN failure modes when models struggle to generalise on low-order graphs, low label coverage, or when a model is over-parameterized. We establish both empirical and theoretical links between GNN robustness and the reduction of the total Dirichlet Energy of learned node representations, which encapsulates the hypothesized GNN smoothness inductive bias. Finally, we introduce two training strategies to enhance GNN robustness: (1) by incorporating a novel inductive bias in the weight matrices through the removal of negative eigenvalues, connected to Dirichlet Energy minimization; (2) by extending to GNNs a loss penalty that promotes learned smoothness. Importantly, neither approach negatively impacts performance in noise-free settings, supporting our hypothesis that the source of GNNs robustness is their smoothness inductive bias.</p></details> |  |

However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</p></details> | MM' 24 |
| **[GDSG: Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation for Optimization Problems in MEC Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08296v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is crucial for MEC networks to function efficiently and reliably, most of which are NP-hard and lack efficient approximation algorithms. This leads to a paucity of optimal solution, constraining the effectiveness of conventional deep learning approaches. Most existing learning-based methods necessitate extensive optimal data and fail to exploit the potential benefits of suboptimal data that can be obtained with greater efficiency and effectiveness. Taking the multi-server multi-user computation offloading (MSCO) problem, which is widely observed in systems like Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, as a concrete scenario, we present a Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation (GDSG) method. This approach is designed to work with suboptimal datasets while converging to the optimal solution large probably. We transform the optimization issue into distribution-learning and offer a clear explanation of learning from suboptimal training datasets. We build GDSG as a multi-task diffusion model utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to acquire the distribution of high-quality solutions. We use a simple and efficient heuristic approach to obtain a sufficient amount of training data composed entirely of suboptimal solutions. In our implementation, we enhance the backbone GNN and achieve improved generalization. GDSG also reaches nearly 100\% task orthogonality, ensuring no interference between the discrete and continuous generation tasks. We further reveal that this orthogonality arises from the diffusion-related training loss, rather than the neural network architecture itself. The experiments demonstrate that GDSG surpasses other benchmark methods on both the optimal and suboptimal training datasets. The MSCO datasets has open-sourced at http://ieee-dataport.org/13824, as well as the GDSG algorithm codes at https://github.com/qiyu3816/GDSG.</p></details> |  |

In logistics, it is a major strategic decision determining operating costs for several years. Solving districting problems using traditional methods is intractable even for small geographical areas and existing heuristics often provide sub-optimal results. We present a structured learning approach to find high-quality solutions to real-world districting problems in a few minutes. It is based on integrating a combinatorial optimization layer, the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem, into a graph neural network architecture. To train this pipeline in a decision-aware fashion, we show how to construct target solutions embedded in a suitable space and learn from target solutions. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods as it can significantly reduce costs on real-world cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[DGNN-YOLO: Interpretable Dynamic Graph Neural Networks with YOLO11 for Small Object Detection and Tracking in Traffic Surveillance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17251v3)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and tracking of small objects, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes, is critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial for improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods face challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small-object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates a DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thereby ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Additionally, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques were applied to DGNN-YOLO to provide model-agnostic interpretability and deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing its transparency and trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This study provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning with Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15950v5)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have seen significant advancements with the influence of deep learning and graph neural networks, particularly in capturing complex user-item relationships. However, these graph-based recommenders heavily depend on ID-based data, potentially disregarding valuable textual information associated with users and items, resulting in less informative learned representations. Moreover, the utilization of implicit feedback data introduces potential noise and bias, posing challenges for the effectiveness of user preference learning. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) into traditional ID-based recommenders has gained attention, challenges such as scalability issues, limitations in text-only reliance, and prompt input constraints need to be addressed for effective implementation in practical recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework RLMRec that aims to enhance existing recommenders with LLM-empowered representation learning. It proposes a recommendation paradigm that integrates representation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of user behaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals, develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns the semantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborative relational signals through a cross-view alignment framework. This work further establish a theoretical foundation demonstrating that incorporating textual signals through mutual information maximization enhances the quality of representations. In our evaluation, we integrate RLMRec with state-of-the-art recommender models, while also analyzing its efficiency and robustness to noise data. Our implementation codes are available at https://github.com/HKUDS/RLMRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WWW'24 full paper</p></details> |

And graph transformers address these issues through self-attention, yet face scalability and noise challenges on large-scale graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose GNNMoE, a universal model architecture for node classification. This architecture flexibly combines fine-grained message-passing operations with a mixture-of-experts mechanism to build feature encoding blocks. Furthermore, by incorporating soft and hard gating layers to assign the most suitable expert networks to each node, we enhance the model's expressive power and adaptability to different graph types. In addition, we introduce adaptive residual connections and an enhanced FFN module into GNNMoE, further improving the expressiveness of node representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GNNMoE performs exceptionally well across various types of graph data, effectively alleviating the over-smoothing issue and global noise, enhancing model robustness and adaptability, while also ensuring computational efficiency on large-scale graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11189</p></details> |
| **[Towards Data-centric Machine Learning on Directed Graphs: a Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01849v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advances in processing structured data. However, most of them primarily adopted a model-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting them into undirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently limited in real-world applications due to the unavoidable information loss in simple undirected graphs and the model optimization challenges that arise when exceeding the upper bounds of this sub-optimal data representational capacity. As a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize improving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of graphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer distinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships, and directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a comprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular focus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel taxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from the data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving data representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed graphs and their quality plays a crucial role in model performance. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+ domains, highlighting their broad applicability. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges within the field, offering insights that can guide future research and development in directed graph learning.</p></details> | In Progress |
| **[Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08174v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</p></details> | Preprint, 26 pages |
| **[Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations:from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23748v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs. While graph kernel methods such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) kernels are effective in capturing similarity relationships, they rely heavily on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearity for more complex data patterns. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Cluster-Enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08066v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personal interaction data can be effectively modeled as individual graphs for each user in recommender systems.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation techniques have become extremely popular since they can capture high-order collaborative signals between users and items by aggregating the individual graph into a global interactive graph.However, this centralized approach inherently poses a threat to user privacy and security. Recently, federated GNN-based recommendation techniques have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate privacy concerns. Nevertheless, current implementations either limit on-device training to an unaccompanied individual graphs or necessitate reliance on an extra third-party server to touch other individual graphs, which also increases the risk of privacy leakage. To address this challenge, we propose a Cluster-enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network framework for Recommendation, named CFedGR, which introduces high-order collaborative signals to augment individual graphs in a privacy preserving manner. Specifically, the server clusters the pretrained user representations to identify high-order collaborative signals. In addition, two efficient strategies are devised to reduce communication between devices and the server. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

We present Matbench Discovery, an evaluation framework for ML energy models, applied as pre-filters for high-throughput searches of stable inorganic crystals. This framework addresses the disconnect between thermodynamic stability and formation energy, as well as retrospective vs. prospective benchmarking in materials discovery. We release a Python package to support model submissions and maintain an online leaderboard, offering insights into performance trade-offs. To identify the best-performing ML methodologies for materials discovery, we benchmarked various approaches, including random forests, graph neural networks (GNNs), one-shot predictors, iterative Bayesian optimizers, and universal interatomic potentials (UIP). Our initial results rank models by test set F1 scores for thermodynamic stability prediction: EquiformerV2 + DeNS > Orb > SevenNet > MACE > CHGNet > M3GNet > ALIGNN > MEGNet > CGCNN > CGCNN+P > Wrenformer > BOWSR > Voronoi fingerprint random forest. UIPs emerge as the top performers, achieving F1 scores of 0.57-0.82 and discovery acceleration factors (DAF) of up to 6x on the first 10k stable predictions compared to random selection. We also identify a misalignment between regression metrics and task-relevant classification metrics. Accurate regressors can yield high false-positive rates near the decision boundary at 0 eV/atom above the convex hull. Our results demonstrate UIPs' ability to optimize computational budget allocation for expanding materials databases. However, their limitations remain underexplored in traditional benchmarks. We advocate for task-based evaluation frameworks, as implemented here, to address these limitations and advance ML-guided materials discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please see online leaderboard at: https://matbench-discovery.materialsproject.org/</p></details> |

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, leading us to new frontiers in chemical understanding and discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML) as a novel approach tailored for molecules, showcasing its potential to advance the field of chemistry. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and TDC. ACML exhibits its capability to revolutionize chemical research and applications, providing a deeper understanding of the chemical semantics of different modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

With a long history in network science, community detection typically relies on objective functions, optimised with custom-tailored search algorithms, but often without leveraging recent advances in deep learning. Recently, first works have started incorporating such objectives into loss functions for deep graph clustering and pooling. We consider the map equation, a popular information-theoretic objective function for unsupervised community detection, and express it in differentiable tensor form for optimisation through gradient descent. Our formulation turns the map equation compatible with any neural network architecture, enables end-to-end learning, incorporates node features, and chooses the optimal number of clusters automatically, all without requiring explicit regularisation. Applied to unsupervised graph clustering tasks, we achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art deep graph clustering baselines in synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-relational nature of Graph neural networks (GNNs) make it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for well-known structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for GNNs employing diagnostic classifiers. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 22 figures, conference</p></details> |

| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Node Generation in Few-Shot Learning on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09872v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs have recently garnered significant attention due to their wide range of applications in web domains. Existing methodologies employ word embedding models for acquiring text representations as node features, which are subsequently fed into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for training. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced their powerful capabilities in information retrieval and text generation, which can greatly enhance the text attributes of graph data. Furthermore, the acquisition and labeling of extensive datasets are both costly and time-consuming endeavors. Consequently, few-shot learning has emerged as a crucial problem in the context of graph learning tasks. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a lightweight paradigm called LLM4NG, which adopts a plug-and-play approach to empower text-attributed graphs through node generation using LLMs. Specifically, we utilize LLMs to extract semantic information from the labels and generate samples that belong to these categories as exemplars. Subsequently, we employ an edge predictor to capture the structural information inherent in the raw dataset and integrate the newly generated samples into the original graph. This approach harnesses LLMs for enhancing class-level information and seamlessly introduces labeled nodes and edges without modifying the raw dataset, thereby facilitating the node classification task in few-shot scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed paradigm, particularly in low-shot scenarios. For instance, in the 1-shot setting of the ogbn-arxiv dataset, LLM4NG achieves a 76% improvement over the baseline model.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Fast Track to Winning Tickets: Repowering One-Shot Pruning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07605v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate superior performance in various graph learning tasks, yet their wider real-world application is hindered by the computational overhead when applied to large-scale graphs. To address the issue, the Graph Lottery Hypothesis (GLT) has been proposed, advocating the identification of subgraphs and subnetworks, \textit{i.e.}, winning tickets, without compromising performance. The effectiveness of current GLT methods largely stems from the use of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), which offers higher stability and better performance than one-shot pruning. However, identifying GLTs is highly computationally expensive, due to the iterative pruning and retraining required by IMP. In this paper, we reevaluate the correlation between one-shot pruning and IMP: while one-shot tickets are suboptimal compared to IMP, they offer a \textit{fast track} to tickets with a stronger performance. We introduce a one-shot pruning and denoising framework to validate the efficacy of the \textit{fast track}. Compared to current IMP-based GLT methods, our framework achieves a double-win situation of graph lottery tickets with \textbf{higher sparsity} and \textbf{faster speeds}. Through extensive experiments across 4 backbones and 6 datasets, our method demonstrates $1.32\% - 45.62\%$ improvement in weight sparsity and a $7.49\% - 22.71\%$ increase in graph sparsity, along with a $1.7-44 \times$ speedup over IMP-based methods and $95.3\%-98.6\%$ MAC savings.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

| **[AHSG: Adversarial Attacks on High-level Semantics in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07468v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant interest among researchers due to their impressive performance in graph learning tasks. However, like other deep neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In existing adversarial attack methods for GNNs, the metric between the attacked graph and the original graph is usually the attack budget or a measure of global graph properties. However, we have found that it is possible to generate attack graphs that disrupt the primary semantics even within these constraints. To address this problem, we propose a Adversarial Attacks on High-level Semantics in Graph Neural Networks (AHSG), which is a graph structure attack model that ensures the retention of primary semantics. The latent representations of each node can extract rich semantic information by applying convolutional operations on graph data. These representations contain both task-relevant primary semantic information and task-irrelevant secondary semantic information. The latent representations of same-class nodes with the same primary semantics can fulfill the objective of modifying secondary semantics while preserving the primary semantics. Finally, the latent representations with attack effects is mapped to an attack graph using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm. By attacking graph deep learning models with some advanced defense strategies, we validate that AHSG has superior attack effectiveness compared to other attack methods. Additionally, we employ Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs) as a proxy for the primary semantics to detect the attacked graph, confirming that AHSG almost does not disrupt the original primary semantics of the graph.</p></details> |  |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multigraph Message Passing with Bi-Directional Multi-Edge Aggregations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00241v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have seen significant advances in recent years, yet their application to multigraphs, where parallel edges exist between the same pair of nodes, remains under-explored. Standard GNNs, designed for simple graphs, compute node representations by combining all connected edges at once, without distinguishing between edges from different neighbors. There are some GNN architectures proposed specifically for multigraphs, yet these architectures perform only node-level aggregation in their message passing layers, which limits their expressive power. Furthermore, these approaches either lack permutation equivariance when a strict total edge ordering is absent, or fail to preserve the topological structure of the multigraph. To address all these shortcomings, we propose MEGA-GNN, a unified framework for message passing on multigraphs that can effectively perform diverse graph learning tasks. Our approach introduces a two-stage aggregation process in the message passing layers: first, parallel edges are aggregated, followed by a node-level aggregation of messages from distinct neighbors. We show that MEGA-GNN is not only permutation equivariant but also universal given a strict total ordering on the edges. Experiments show that MEGA-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to 13\% on Anti-Money Laundering datasets and is on par with their accuracy on real-world phishing classification datasets in terms of minority class F1 score.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Given their substantial empirical success, there is an escalating interest in TGNNs within the research community. However, the majority of these efforts have been channelled towards algorithm and system design, with the evaluation metrics receiving comparatively less attention. Effective evaluation metrics are crucial for providing detailed performance insights, particularly in the temporal domain. This paper investigates the commonly used evaluation metrics for TGNNs and illustrates the failure mechanisms of these metrics in capturing essential temporal structures in the predictive behaviour of TGNNs. We provide a mathematical formulation of existing performance metrics and utilize an instance-based study to underscore their inadequacies in identifying volatility clustering (the occurrence of emerging errors within a brief interval). This phenomenon has profound implications for both algorithm and system design in the temporal domain. To address this deficiency, we introduce a new volatility-aware evaluation metric (termed volatility cluster statistics), designed for a more refined analysis of model temporal performance. Additionally, we demonstrate how this metric can serve as a temporal-volatility-aware training objective to alleviate the clustering of temporal errors. Through comprehensive experiments on various TGNN models, we validate our analysis and the proposed approach. The empirical results offer revealing insights: 1) existing TGNNs are prone to making errors with volatility clustering, and 2) TGNNs with different mechanisms to capture temporal information exhibit distinct volatility clustering patterns. Our empirical findings demonstrate that our proposed training objective effectively reduces volatility clusters in error.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Dynamical Systems-Inspired Pruning Strategy for Addressing Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07243v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) poses a significant challenge as network depth increases, leading to homogenized node representations and a loss of expressiveness. In this work, we approach the oversmoothing problem from a dynamical systems perspective, providing a deeper understanding of the stability and convergence behavior of GNNs. Leveraging insights from dynamical systems theory, we identify the root causes of oversmoothing and propose \textbf{\textit{DYNAMO-GAT}}. This approach utilizes noise-driven covariance analysis and Anti-Hebbian principles to selectively prune redundant attention weights, dynamically adjusting the network's behavior to maintain node feature diversity and stability. Our theoretical analysis reveals how DYNAMO-GAT disrupts the convergence to oversmoothed states, while experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional and state-of-the-art methods. DYNAMO-GAT not only advances the theoretical understanding of oversmoothing through the lens of dynamical systems but also provides a practical and effective solution for improving the stability and expressiveness of deep GNNs.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Are More Than Filters: Revisiting and Benchmarking from A Spectral Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07188v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based learning tasks. While their performance is often attributed to the powerful neighborhood aggregation mechanism, recent studies suggest that other components such as non-linear layers may also significantly affecting how GNNs process the input graph data in the spectral domain. Such evidence challenges the prevalent opinion that neighborhood aggregation mechanisms dominate the behavioral characteristics of GNNs in the spectral domain. To demystify such a conflict, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark to measure and evaluate GNNs' capability in capturing and leveraging the information encoded in different frequency components of the input graph data. Specifically, we first conduct an exploratory study demonstrating that GNNs can flexibly yield outputs with diverse frequency components even when certain frequencies are absent or filtered out from the input graph data. We then formulate a novel research problem of measuring and benchmarking the performance of GNNs from a spectral perspective. To take an initial step towards a comprehensive benchmark, we design an evaluation protocol supported by comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark on real-world datasets, revealing insights that challenge prevalent opinions from a spectral perspective. We believe that our findings will open new avenues for future advancements in this area. Our implementations can be found at: https://github.com/yushundong/Spectral-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Graphs that require distributed settings are often too large to fit in the main memory of a single machine. This challenge renders traditional in-memory graph partitioners infeasible, leading to the emergence of streaming solutions. Streaming partitioners produce lower-quality partitions because they work from partial information and must make premature decisions before they have a complete view of a vertex's neighborhood. We introduce CUTTANA, a streaming graph partitioner that partitions massive graphs (Web/Twitter scale) with superior quality compared to existing streaming solutions. CUTTANA uses a novel buffering technique that prevents the premature assignment of vertices to partitions and a scalable coarsening and refinement technique that enables a complete graph view, improving the intermediate assignment made by a streaming partitioner. We implemented a parallel version for CUTTANA that offers nearly the same partitioning latency as existing streaming partitioners. Our experimental analysis shows that CUTTANA consistently yields better partitioning quality than existing state-of-the-art streaming vertex partitioners in terms of both edge-cut and communication volume metrics. We also evaluate the workload latencies that result from using CUTTANA and other partitioners in distributed graph analytics and databases. CUTTANA outperforms the other methods in most scenarios (algorithms, datasets). In analytics applications, CUTTANA improves runtime performance by up to 59% compared to various streaming partitioners (HDRF, Fennel, Ginger, HeiStream). In graph database tasks, CUTTANA results in higher query throughput by up to 23%, without hurting tail latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VLDB 2025 (Vol.18, No.1).

These techniques, such as Incomplete Cholesky factorization (IC) and data-driven neural network methods, accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers like Conjugate Gradient (CG) by approximating the original matrices. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) with traditional IC, addressing the shortcomings of direct generation methods based on GNN and achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate an average reduction in iteration counts by 24.8% compared to IC and a two-order-of-magnitude increase in training scale compared to previous methods. A three-dimensional static structural analysis utilizing finite element methods was validated on training sparse matrices of up to 5 million dimensions and inference scales of up to 10 million. Furthermore, the approach demon-strates robust generalization capabilities across scales, facilitating the effective acceleration of CG solvers for large-scale linear equations using small-scale data on modest hardware. The method's robustness and scalability make it a practical solution for computational science.</p></details> |  |

However, MPNNs' generalization abilities -- making meaningful predictions beyond the training set -- remain less explored. Current generalization analyses often overlook graph structure, limit the focus to specific aggregation functions, and assume the impractical, hard-to-optimize $0$-$1$ loss function. Here, we extend recent advances in graph similarity theory to assess the influence of graph structure, aggregation, and loss functions on MPNNs' generalization abilities. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, improving our understanding of MPNNs' generalization properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-Enhanced Molecule Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01631v5)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning is vital for various downstream applications, including the analysis and prediction of molecular properties and side effects. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a popular framework for modeling molecular data, they often struggle to capture the full complexity of molecular representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called GODE, which accounts for the dual-level structure inherent in molecules. Molecules possess an intrinsic graph structure and simultaneously function as nodes within a broader molecular knowledge graph. GODE integrates individual molecular graph representations with multi-domain biochemical data from knowledge graphs. By pre-training two GNNs on different graph structures and employing contrastive learning, GODE effectively fuses molecular structures with their corresponding knowledge graph substructures. This fusion yields a more robust and informative representation, enhancing molecular property predictions by leveraging both chemical and biological information. When fine-tuned across 11 chemical property tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving an average ROC-AUC improvement of 12.7% for classification tasks and an average RMSE/MAE improvement of 34.4% for regression tasks. Notably, GODE surpasses the current leading model in property prediction, with advancements of 2.2% in classification and 7.2% in regression tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[MISFEAT: Feature Selection for Subgroups with Systematic Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06711v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of selecting features for datasets that can be naturally partitioned into subgroups (e.g., according to socio-demographic groups and age), each with its own dominant set of features. Within this subgroup-oriented framework, we address the challenge of systematic missing data, a scenario in which some feature values are missing for all tuples of a subgroup, due to flawed data integration, regulatory constraints, or privacy concerns. Feature selection is governed by finding mutual Information, a popular quantification of correlation, between features and a target variable. Our goal is to identify top-K feature subsets of some fixed size with the highest joint mutual information with a target variable. In the presence of systematic missing data, the closed form of mutual information could not simply be applied. We argue that in such a setting, leveraging relationships between available feature mutual information within a subgroup or across subgroups can assist inferring missing mutual information values. We propose a generalizable model based on heterogeneous graph neural network to identify interdependencies between feature-subgroup-target variable connections by modeling it as a multiplex graph, and employing information propagation between its nodes. We address two distinct scalability challenges related to training and propose principled solutions to tackle them. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions both qualitatively and running time wise.</p></details> |  |

GNNs have recently become a widely used graph analysis method due to their superior ability to learn representations for complex graph data. However, due to privacy concerns and regulation restrictions, centralized GNNs can be difficult to apply to data-sensitive scenarios. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technology developed for privacy-preserving settings when several parties need to train a shared global model collaboratively. Although several research works have applied FL to train GNNs (Federated GNNs), there is no research on their robustness to backdoor attacks. This paper bridges this gap by conducting two types of backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs: centralized backdoor attacks (CBA) and distributed backdoor attacks (DBA). Our experiments show that the DBA attack success rate is higher than CBA in almost all evaluated cases. For CBA, the attack success rate of all local triggers is similar to the global trigger even if the training set of the adversarial party is embedded with the global trigger. To further explore the properties of two backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs, we evaluate the attack performance for a different number of clients, trigger sizes, poisoning intensities, and trigger densities. Moreover, we explore the robustness of DBA and CBA against one defense. We find that both attacks are robust against the investigated defense, necessitating the need to consider backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs as a novel threat that requires custom defenses.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

Because graph data does not follow the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, adversarial manipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through message passing, which deteriorates the model's performance. To allow model developers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained GNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find that current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of manipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new graph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the manipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the performance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating retraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient. We hope our work assists GNN developers in mitigating harmful effects caused by issues in real-world data post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/varshitakolipaka/corrective-unlearning-for-gnns</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17365v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 22 figures.

| **[Automated Label Unification for Multi-Dataset Semantic Segmentation with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10534v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep supervised models possess significant capability to assimilate extensive training data, thereby presenting an opportunity to enhance model performance through training on multiple datasets. However, conflicts arising from different label spaces among datasets may adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically construct a unified label space across multiple datasets using graph neural networks. This enables semantic segmentation models to be trained simultaneously on multiple datasets, resulting in performance improvements. Unlike existing methods, our approach facilitates seamless training without the need for additional manual reannotation or taxonomy reconciliation. This significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-dataset segmentation model training. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other multi-dataset training methods when trained on seven datasets simultaneously, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildDash 2 benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We first propose a second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional ET. Utilizing this model, we derive novel closed-form Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the ET kinematic parameter estimation, such as the center range, azimuth angle, elevation angle, and orientation. Further, we formulate and solve two transmit beamforming design problems with optimization algorithms. The first one, named the CRB minimization problem, minimizes the CRB under constraints of communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, transmit power, and ET-specific beam coverage requirement, which is solved using the semidefinite relaxation technique. The second one, named the weighted-ISAC-metric problem, targets an weighted objective function combining the communication sum rate and sensing CRB, and is solved using the successive convex approximation technique. Additionally, by exploiting the penalty method, we introduce an unsupervised learning-based approach and propose a unique ISAC graph neural network (ISACGNN), composed of separate communication, sensing, and integration modules, to address both problems. Numerical results reveal the diverse CRB characteristics for different radar targets. The proposed beamforming designs are superior to existing baselines with better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and a more appropriate beampattern for sensing the 3D ET. Besides, our proposed ISACGNN can effectively mimic the dynamic structures of the SINR, sum rate, and CRB, demonstrating remarkable scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, partially published in IEEE Global Communications Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network(GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering(CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning(CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

The paper discusses the construction of a stock industry relationship graph and the extraction of temporal information from historical price sequences. It also highlights the design of a graph convolution operation and a temporal attention aggregator to model the macro market state. The integration of these features results in a comprehensive stock prediction model that addresses the challenges of utilizing stock relationship data and modeling hierarchical attributes in the stock market.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-guided Multimodal Approach to Enhancing Graph Representation Learning for Alzheimer's Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06212v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models designed to handle irregularly structured data. However, their generic design often proves inadequate for analyzing brain connectomes in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), highlighting the need to incorporate domain knowledge for optimal performance. Infusing AD-related knowledge into GNNs is a complicated task. Existing methods typically rely on collaboration between computer scientists and domain experts, which can be both time-intensive and resource-demanding. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel self-guided, knowledge-infused multimodal GNN that autonomously incorporates domain knowledge into the model development process. Our approach conceptualizes domain knowledge as natural language and introduces a specialized multimodal GNN capable of leveraging this uncurated knowledge to guide the learning process of the GNN, such that it can improve the model performance and strengthen the interpretability of the predictions. To evaluate our framework, we curated a comprehensive dataset of recent peer-reviewed papers on AD and integrated it with multiple real-world AD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to extract relevant domain knowledge, provide graph-based explanations for AD diagnosis, and improve the overall performance of the GNN. This approach provides a more scalable and efficient alternative to inject domain knowledge for AD compared with the manual design from the domain expert, advancing both prediction accuracy and interpretability in AD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

As a result, it becomes necessary to develop joint models that encompass both antennas and wireless propagation channels. To achieve this, we utilize the multi-port communication theory, which considers impedance matching among the source, transmission medium, and load to facilitate efficient power transfer. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of insertion loss, mutual coupling, and other factors on the performance of multi-port matching networks. Next, to further improve system performance, we explore two important deep unfolding designs for the multi-port matching networks: beamforming and power control, respectively. For the hybrid beamforming, we develop a deep unfolding framework, i.e., projected gradient descent (PGD)-Net based on unfolding projected gradient descent. For the power control, we design a deep unfolding network, graph neural network (GNN) aided alternating optimization (AO)Net, which considers the interaction between different ports in optimizing power allocation. Numerical results verify the necessity of considering insertion loss in the dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) performance analysis. Besides, the proposed PGD-Net based hybrid beamforming approaches approximate the conventional model-based algorithm with very low complexity. Moreover, our proposed power control scheme has a fast run time compared to the traditional weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Necessity of Graph Learning and Common Graph Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06173v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning has enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity since the introduction of deep learning in graph contexts. This is no surprise due to the ubiquity of graph data in large scale industrial settings. Tacitly assumed in all graph learning tasks is the separation of the graph structure and node features: node features strictly encode individual data while the graph structure consists only of pairwise interactions. The driving belief is that node features are (by themselves) insufficient for these tasks, so benchmark performance accurately reflects improvements in graph learning. In our paper, we challenge this orthodoxy by showing that, surprisingly, node features are oftentimes more-than-sufficient for many common graph benchmarks, breaking this critical assumption. When comparing against a well-tuned feature-only MLP baseline on seven of the most commonly used graph learning datasets, one gains little benefit from using graph structure on five datasets. We posit that these datasets do not benefit considerably from graph learning because the features themselves already contain enough graph information to obviate or substantially reduce the need for the graph. To illustrate this point, we perform a feature study on these datasets and show how the features are responsible for closing the gap between MLP and graph-method performance. Further, in service of introducing better empirical measures of progress for graph neural networks, we present a challenging parametric family of principled synthetic datasets that necessitate graph information for nontrivial performance. Lastly, we section out a subset of real-world datasets that are not trivially solved by an MLP and hence serve as reasonable benchmarks for graph neural networks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts.

Currently, GNNs in networked systems mostly follow a paradigm of `centralized training, distributed execution', which limits their adaptability and slows down their development cycles. In this work, we fill this gap for the first time by developing a communication-efficient, fully distributed online training approach for GNNs applied to large networked systems. For a mini-batch with $B$ samples, our approach of training an $L$-layer GNN only adds $L$ rounds of message passing to the $LB$ rounds required by GNN inference, with doubled message sizes. Through numerical experiments in graph-based node regression, power allocation, and link scheduling in wireless networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in training GNNs under supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Machine Learning (ML) has recently played a key role in advancing HT research. Various novel techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown HT insertion and detection capabilities. HT insertion with ML techniques, specifically, has seen a spike in research activity due to the shortcomings of conventional HT benchmarks and the inherent human design bias that occurs when we create them. This work continues this innovation by presenting a tool called TrojanForge, capable of generating HT adversarial examples that defeat HT detectors; demonstrating the capabilities of GAN-like adversarial tools for automatic HT insertion. We introduce an RL environment where the RL insertion agent interacts with HT detectors in an insertion-detection loop where the agent collects rewards based on its success in bypassing HT detectors. Our results show that this process helps inserted HTs evade various HT detectors, achieving high attack success percentages. This tool provides insight into why HT insertion fails in some instances and how we can leverage this knowledge in defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Machine Learning on Graphs with Nonlinear Spectral Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01249v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space. We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional MLP learning relies almost exclusively on graph nodes and fails to effectively capture the graph structural information. Previous methods address this issue by processing graph edges into extra inputs for MLPs, but such graph structures may be unavailable for various scenarios. To this end, we propose Prototype-Guided Knowledge Distillation (PGKD), which does not require graph edges (edge-free setting) yet learns structure-aware MLPs. Our insight is to distill graph structural information from GNNs. Specifically, we first employ the class prototypes to analyze the impact of graph structures on GNN teachers, and then design two losses to distill such information from GNNs to MLPs. Experimental results on popular graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGKD.</p></details> | COLING 2025 |

In this paper, we present an extensive empirical study to investigate the impact of graph reduction techniques, specifically graph coarsening and sparsification, on the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments involving multiple datasets and GNN architectures, we examine the effects of four sparsification and six coarsening methods on the poisoning attacks. Our results indicate that, while graph sparsification can mitigate the effectiveness of certain poisoning attacks, such as Mettack, it has limited impact on others, like PGD. Conversely, graph coarsening tends to amplify the adversarial impact, significantly reducing classification accuracy as the reduction ratio decreases. Additionally, we provide a novel analysis of the causes driving these effects and examine how defensive GNN models perform under graph reduction, offering practical insights for designing robust GNNs within graph acceleration systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Merging for Enhancing the Link Stealing Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05830v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically designed to process the graph data, have achieved remarkable success in various applications. Link stealing attacks on graph data pose a significant privacy threat, as attackers aim to extract sensitive relationships between nodes (entities), potentially leading to academic misconduct, fraudulent transactions, or other malicious activities. Previous studies have primarily focused on single datasets and did not explore cross-dataset attacks, let alone attacks that leverage the combined knowledge of multiple attackers. However, we find that an attacker can combine the data knowledge of multiple attackers to create a more effective attack model, which can be referred to cross-dataset attacks. Moreover, if knowledge can be extracted with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the attack capability will be more significant. In this paper, we propose a novel link stealing attack method that takes advantage of cross-dataset and Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM is applied to process datasets with different data structures in cross-dataset attacks. Each attacker fine-tunes the LLM on their specific dataset to generate a tailored attack model. We then introduce a novel model merging method to integrate the parameters of these attacker-specific models effectively. The result is a merged attack model with superior generalization capabilities, enabling effective attacks not only on the attackers' datasets but also on previously unseen (out-of-domain) datasets. We conducted extensive experiments in four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additional experiments with three different GNN and LLM architectures further illustrate the generality of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link Stealing Attacks, Large Language Models, Graph Neural Networks, Privacy Attacks, Model Merging</p></details> |
| **[GL-Fusion: Rethinking the Combination of Graph Neural Network and Large Language model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06849v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically follows two approaches: LLM-centered models, which convert graph data into tokens for LLM processing, and GNN-centered models, which use LLMs to encode text features into node and edge representations for GNN input. LLM-centered models often struggle to capture graph structures effectively, while GNN-centered models compress variable-length textual data into fixed-size vectors, limiting their ability to understand complex semantics. Additionally, GNN-centered approaches require converting tasks into a uniform, manually-designed format, restricting them to classification tasks and preventing language output. To address these limitations, we introduce a new architecture that deeply integrates GNN with LLM, featuring three key innovations: (1) Structure-Aware Transformers, which incorporate GNN's message-passing capabilities directly into LLM's transformer layers, allowing simultaneous processing of textual and structural information and generating outputs from both GNN and LLM; (2) Graph-Text Cross-Attention, which processes full, uncompressed text from graph nodes and edges, ensuring complete semantic integration; and (3) GNN-LLM Twin Predictor, enabling LLM's flexible autoregressive generation alongside GNN's scalable one-pass prediction. GL-Fusion achieves outstand performance on various tasks. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on OGBN-Arxiv and OGBG-Code2.</p></details> | under review |

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named BEV-SUSHI, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, BEV-SUSHI has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed BEV-SUSHI establishes the new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with 81.22 HOTA, and 95.6 IDF1 on the WildTrack dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the II edition of the Workshop on Unifying Representations in Neural Models (UniReps 2024)</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |

While traditional approaches like queuing theory and packet-level simulation have served as foundational tools, they face limitations in modeling complex traffic behaviors and scaling to large networks. This project presents an extended implementation of RouteNet-Fermi, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed for network performance prediction, with additional recurrent neural network variants. We improve the the original architecture by implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cells alongside the existing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells implementation. This work contributes to the understanding of recurrent neural architectures in GNN-based network modeling and provides a flexible framework for future experimentation with different cell types.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Precise sales forecasts for unreleased items could drastically improve the efficiency and profits of industries. However, predicting the success of entirely new styles is difficult due to the absence of past data and ever-changing trends. Specifically, currently used deterministic models struggle with domain shifts when encountering items outside their training data. The recently proposed diffusion models address this issue using a continuous-time diffusion process. Specifically, these models enable us to predict the sales of new items, mitigating the domain shift challenges encountered by deterministic models. As a result, this paper proposes Dif4FF, a novel two-stage pipeline for New Fashion Product Performance Forecasting (NFPPF) that leverages the power of diffusion models conditioned on multimodal data related to specific clothes. Dif4FF first utilizes a multimodal score-based diffusion model to forecast multiple sales trajectories for various garments over time. The forecasts are refined using a powerful Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture. By leveraging the GCN's capability to capture long-range dependencies within both the temporal and spatial data and seeking the optimal solution between these two dimensions, Dif4FF offers the most accurate and efficient forecasting system available in the literature for predicting the sales of new items. We tested Dif4FF on VISUELLE, the de facto standard for NFPPF, achieving new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)</p></details> |

Specifically, in the industrial GUI-to-code process, fragmented layers may decrease the readability and maintainability of generated code, which can be alleviated by grouping semantically consistent fragmented layers in the design prototypes. This study aims to propose a graph-learning-based approach to tackle the fragmented layer grouping problem according to multi-modal information in design prototypes. Our graph learning module consists of self-attention and graph neural network modules. By taking the multimodal fused representation of GUI layers as input, we innovatively group fragmented layers by classifying GUI layers and regressing the bounding boxes of the corresponding GUI components simultaneously. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. A further user study is also conducted to validate that our approach can assist an intelligent downstream tool in generating more maintainable and readable front-end code.</p></details> | 28 pages,6 figures |
| **[Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt Learning for Urban Flow Prediction under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05534v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban flow prediction is a classic spatial-temporal forecasting task that estimates the amount of future traffic flow for a given location. Though models represented by Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have established themselves as capable predictors, they tend to suffer from distribution shifts that are common with the urban flow data due to the dynamics and unpredictability of spatial-temporal events. Unfortunately, in spatial-temporal applications, the dynamic environments can hardly be quantified via a fixed number of parameters, whereas learning time- and location-specific environments can quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt learning (MIP) for urban flow prediction under constant distribution shifts. Specifically, MIP is equipped with a learnable memory bank that is trained to memorize the causal features within the spatial-temporal graph. By querying a trainable memory bank that stores the causal features, we adaptively extract invariant and variant prompts (i.e., patterns) for a given location at every time step. Then, instead of intervening the raw data based on simulated environments, we directly perform intervention on variant prompts across space and time. With the intervened variant prompts in place, we use invariant learning to minimize the variance of predictions, so as to ensure that the predictions are only made with invariant features. With extensive comparative experiments on two public urban flow datasets, we thoroughly demonstrate the robustness of MIP against OOD data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Homophilic Graph Pre-Training and Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12594v4)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex relationships between objects across various fields. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We delineate a novel State Augmentation (SA) strategy to maximize the aggregate information at source nodes using graph neural network (GNN) architectures, by deploying graph convolutions over the topological links of the communication network. The proposed technique leverages only the local information available at each node and efficiently routes desired information to the destination nodes. We leverage an unsupervised learning procedure to convert the output of the GNN architecture to optimal information routing strategies. In the experiments, we perform the evaluation on real-time network topologies to validate our algorithms. Numerical simulations depict the improved performance of the proposed method in training a GNN parameterization as compared to baseline algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The Intelligible and Effective Graph Neural Additive Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01317v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[An end-to-end attention-based approach for learning on graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10793v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent surge in transformer-based architectures for learning on graphs, mainly motivated by attention as an effective learning mechanism and the desire to supersede handcrafted operators characteristic of message passing schemes. However, concerns over their empirical effectiveness, scalability, and complexity of the pre-processing steps have been raised, especially in relation to much simpler graph neural networks that typically perform on par with them across a wide range of benchmarks. To tackle these shortcomings, we consider graphs as sets of edges and propose a purely attention-based approach consisting of an encoder and an attention pooling mechanism. The encoder vertically interleaves masked and vanilla self-attention modules to learn an effective representations of edges, while allowing for tackling possible misspecifications in input graphs. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms fine-tuned message passing baselines and recently proposed transformer-based methods on more than 70 node and graph-level tasks, including challenging long-range benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different tasks, ranging from molecular to vision graphs, and heterophilous node classification. The approach also outperforms graph neural networks and transformers in transfer learning settings, and scales much better than alternatives with a similar performance level or expressive power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12841v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural network-based entity alignment methods have achieved promising results in Euclidean space. However, KGs often contain complex structures, including both local and hierarchical ones, which make it challenging to efficiently represent them within a single space. In this paper, we proposed a novel method UniEA, which unifies dual-space embedding to preserve the intrinsic structure of KGs. Specifically, we learn graph structure embedding in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces simultaneously to maximize the consistency between the embedding in both spaces. Moreover, we employ contrastive learning to mitigate the misalignment issues caused by similar entities, where embedding of similar neighboring entities within the KG become too close in distance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in structure-based EA.

Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve JSSPs, albeit lacking a systematic survey of the relevant literature. This paper aims to thoroughly review prevailing GNN methods for different types of JSSPs and the closely related flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), especially those leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities. We hope this survey can motivate and inspire innovative approaches for more powerful GNN-based approaches in tackling JSSPs and other scheduling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computers & Operations Research</p></details> |

| **[Code generation and runtime techniques for enabling data-efficient deep learning training on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04747v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep learning models scale, their training cost has surged significantly. Due to both hardware advancements and limitations in current software stacks, the need for data efficiency has risen. Data efficiency refers to the effective hiding of data access latency and the avoidance of unnecessary data movements. Major challenges arise from the growing disparity between GPU memory bandwidth and computational throughput, imminent GPU memory capacity limitations, and inefficiencies in the PyTorch software stack, including a lack of device-specific PCIe transfer optimizations and high-level domain-specific abstractions. To effectively mitigate these data inefficiencies for deep learning training, this dissertation analyzes data inefficiency in representative deep training tasks, specifically in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). It then proposes novel runtime and code generation techniques to mitigate these challenges and implements these optimizations seamlessly within the PyTorch stack while maintaining strong programmability and interoperability. First, PyTorch-Direct is devised to incorporate the GPU-centric PCIe data transfer paradigm in PyTorch for GNN training. Next, Hector intermediate representation (IR) and its code generator are proposed to introduce domain-specific high-level abstraction and systematically address memory-intensive performance challenges for relational GNNs. Finally, in LLM training, the throughput has been increasingly constrained by GPU memory capacity. To mitigate this, the SSDTrain offloading framework is designed and implemented. Together, these contributions show that code generation and runtime techniques can systematically mitigate the data management bottlenecks in deep learning training, which stem from the data-intensive nature of workloads and the oversimplification inherent in the deep learning training software stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ph.D....</summary><p>Ph.D. Thesis, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2024</p></details> |

To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

While it is standard to apply graph neural networks or graph kernel methods, Gaussian processes can be employed by transforming spatial features from the graph domain into spectral features in the Euclidean domain, and using them as the input points of classical kernels. However, this approach currently only takes into account features on vertices, whereas some graph datasets also support features on edges. In this work, we present a Gaussian process-based classification algorithm that can leverage one or both vertex and edges features. Furthermore, we take advantage of the Hodge decomposition to better capture the intricate richness of vertex and edge features, which can be beneficial on diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Bayesian Decision-Making and Uncertainty (Oral Presentation)</p></details> |
