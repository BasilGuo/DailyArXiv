| **[A Comparison of Deep Learning Architectures for Spacecraft Anomaly   Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12864v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spacecraft operations are highly critical, demanding impeccable reliability and safety. Ensuring the optimal performance of a spacecraft requires the early detection and mitigation of anomalies, which could otherwise result in unit or mission failures. With the advent of deep learning, a surge of interest has been seen in leveraging these sophisticated algorithms for anomaly detection in space operations. This study aims to compare the efficacy of various deep learning architectures in detecting anomalies in spacecraft data. The deep learning models under investigation include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based architectures. Each of these models was trained and validated using a comprehensive dataset sourced from multiple spacecraft missions, encompassing diverse operational scenarios and anomaly types. Initial results indicate that while CNNs excel in identifying spatial patterns and may be effective for some classes of spacecraft data, LSTMs and RNNs show a marked proficiency in capturing temporal anomalies seen in time-series spacecraft telemetry. The Transformer-based architectures, given their ability to focus on both local and global contexts, have showcased promising results, especially in scenarios where anomalies are subtle and span over longer durations. Additionally, considerations such as computational efficiency, ease of deployment, and real-time processing capabilities were evaluated. While CNNs and LSTMs demonstrated a balance between accuracy and computational demands, Transformer architectures, though highly accurate, require significant computational resources. In conclusion, the choice of deep learning architecture for spacecraft anomaly detection is highly contingent on the nature of the data, the type of anomalies, and operational constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE Aeroconf 2024</p></details> |
| **[Behave-XAI: Deep Explainable Learning of Behavioral Representational   Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00016v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>According to the latest trend of artificial intelligence, AI-systems needs to clarify regarding general,specific decisions,services provided by it. Only consumer is satisfied, with explanation , for example, why any classification result is the outcome of any given time. This actually motivates us using explainable or human understandable AI for a behavioral mining scenario, where users engagement on digital platform is determined from context, such as emotion, activity, weather, etc. However, the output of AI-system is not always systematically correct, and often systematically correct, but apparently not-perfect and thereby creating confusions, such as, why the decision is given? What is the reason underneath? In this context, we first formulate the behavioral mining problem in deep convolutional neural network architecture. Eventually, we apply a recursive neural network due to the presence of time-series data from users physiological and environmental sensor-readings. Once the model is developed, explanations are presented with the advent of XAI models in front of users. This critical step involves extensive trial with users preference on explanations over conventional AI, judgement of credibility of explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn by arXiv administrators as the   second author was added without their knowledge or consent</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Dynamic Memory Requirements for Scientific Workflow Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08185v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing amount of data available to scientists in disciplines as diverse as bioinformatics, physics, and remote sensing, scientific workflow systems are becoming increasingly important for composing and executing scalable data analysis pipelines. When writing such workflows, users need to specify the resources to be reserved for tasks so that sufficient resources are allocated on the target cluster infrastructure. Crucially, underestimating a task's memory requirements can result in task failures. Therefore, users often resort to overprovisioning, resulting in significant resource wastage and decreased throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel online method that uses monitoring time series data to predict task memory usage in order to reduce the memory wastage of scientific workflow tasks. Our method predicts a task's runtime, divides it into k equally-sized segments, and learns the peak memory value for each segment depending on the total file input size. We evaluate the prototype implementation of our method using workflows from the publicly available nf-core repository, showing an average memory wastage reduction of 29.48% compared to the best state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in 2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</p></details> |
| **[On the use of the cumulant generating function for inference on time   series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12714v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce innovative inference procedures for analyzing time series data. Our methodology enables density approximation and composite hypothesis testing based on Whittle's estimator, a widely applied M-estimator in the frequency domain. Its core feature involves the (general Legendre transform of the) cumulant generating function of the Whittle likelihood score, as obtained using an approximated distribution of the periodogram ordinates. We present a testing algorithm that significantly expands the applicability of the state-of-the-art saddlepoint test, while maintaining the numerical accuracy of the saddlepoint approximation. Additionally, we demonstrate connections between our findings and three other prevalent frequency domain approaches: the bootstrap, empirical likelihood, and exponential tilting. Numerical examples using both simulated and real data illustrate the advantages and accuracy of our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Contrastive Learning Strategy Search for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12641v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Contrastive Learning (CL) has become a predominant representation learning paradigm for time series. Most existing methods in the literature focus on manually building specific Contrastive Learning Strategies (CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually developing CLS usually require excessive prior knowledge about the datasets and tasks, e.g., professional cognition of the medical time series in healthcare, as well as huge human labor and massive experiments to determine the detailed learning configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns to contrastively learn representations for various time series datasets and tasks, namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled universal search space of size over 3x1012, covering data augmentation, embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction and contrastive losses. Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain more effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world tasks and datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the suitable CLS for a given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets. We also provide empirical analysis as a guidance for future design of CLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Foundations of Causal Discovery on Groups of Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07047v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a challenging task that relies on assumptions connecting statistical quantities to graphical or algebraic causal models. In this work, we focus on widely employed assumptions for causal discovery when objects of interest are (multivariate) groups of random variables rather than individual (univariate) random variables, as is the case in a variety of problems in scientific domains such as climate science or neuroscience. If the group-level causal models are derived from partitioning a micro-level model into groups, we explore the relationship between micro and group-level causal discovery assumptions. We investigate the conditions under which assumptions like Causal Faithfulness hold or fail to hold. Our analysis encompasses graphical causal models that contain cycles and bidirected edges. We also discuss grouped time series causal graphs and variants thereof as special cases of our general theoretical framework. Thereby, we aim to provide researchers with a solid theoretical foundation for the development and application of causal discovery methods for variable groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version, minor restructuring.

| **[A Bayesian multilevel hidden Markov model with Poisson-lognormal   emissions for intense longitudinal count data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12561v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are probabilistic methods in which observations are seen as realizations of a latent Markov process with discrete states that switch over time. Moving beyond standard statistical tests, HMMs offer a statistical environment to optimally exploit the information present in multivariate time series, uncovering the latent dynamics that rule them. Here, we extend the Poisson HMM to the multilevel framework, accommodating variability between individuals with continuously distributed individual random effects following a lognormal distribution, and describe how to estimate the model in a fully parametric Bayesian framework. The proposed multilevel HMM enables probabilistic decoding of hidden state sequences from multivariate count time-series based on individual-specific parameters, and offers a framework to quantificate between-individual variability formally. Through a Monte Carlo study we show that the multilevel HMM outperforms the HMM for scenarios involving heterogeneity between individuals, demonstrating improved decoding accuracy and estimation performance of parameters of the emission distribution, and performs equally well when not between heterogeneity is present. Finally, we illustrate how to use our model to explore the latent dynamics governing complex multivariate count data in an empirical application concerning pilot whale diving behaviour in the wild, and how to identify neural states from multi-electrode recordings of motor neural cortex activity in a macaque monkey in an experimental set up. We make the multilevel HMM introduced in this study publicly available in the R-package mHMMbayes in CRAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting COVID-19 hospitalisation using a mixture of Bayesian   predictive syntheses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06134v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel methodology called the mixture of Bayesian predictive syntheses (MBPS) for multiple time series count data for the challenging task of predicting the numbers of COVID-19 inpatients and isolated cases in Japan and Korea at the subnational-level. MBPS combines a set of predictive models and partitions the multiple time series into clusters based on their contribution to predicting the outcome. In this way, MBPS leverages the shared information within each cluster and is suitable for predicting COVID-19 inpatients since the data exhibit similar dynamics over multiple areas. Also, MBPS avoids using a multivariate count model, which is generally cumbersome to develop and implement. Our Japanese and Korean data analyses demonstrate that the proposed MBPS methodology has improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient tensor regression for high-dimensional data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13734v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most currently used tensor regression models for high-dimensional data are based on Tucker decomposition, which has good properties but loses its efficiency in compressing tensors very quickly as the order of tensors increases, say greater than four or five. However, for the simplest tensor autoregression in handling time series data, its coefficient tensor already has the order of six. This paper revises a newly proposed tensor train (TT) decomposition and then applies it to tensor regression such that a nice statistical interpretation can be obtained. The new tensor regression can well match the data with hierarchical structures, and it even can lead to a better interpretation for the data with factorial structures, which are supposed to be better fitted by models with Tucker decomposition. More importantly, the new tensor regression can be easily applied to the case with higher order tensors since TT decomposition can compress the coefficient tensors much more efficiently. The methodology is also extended to tensor autoregression for time series data, and nonasymptotic properties are derived for the ordinary least squares estimations of both tensor regression and autoregression. A new algorithm is introduced to search for estimators, and its theoretical justification is also discussed. Theoretical and computational properties of the proposed methodology are verified by simulation studies, and the advantages over existing methods are illustrated by two real examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Multi-Pattern Normalities in the Frequency Domain for Efficient   Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16191v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection significantly enhances the robustness of cloud systems. While neural network-based methods have recently demonstrated strong advantages, they encounter practical challenges in cloud environments: the contradiction between the impracticality of maintaining a unique model for each service and the limited ability to deal with diverse normal patterns by a unified model, as well as issues with handling heavy traffic in real time and short-term anomaly detection sensitivity.   Thus, we propose MACE, a multi-normal-pattern accommodated and efficient anomaly detection method in the frequency domain for time series anomaly detection. There are three novel characteristics of it: (i) a pattern extraction mechanism excelling at handling diverse normal patterns with a unified model, which enables the model to identify anomalies by examining the correlation between the data sample and its service normal pattern, instead of solely focusing on the data sample itself; (ii) a dualistic convolution mechanism that amplifies short-term anomalies in the time domain and hinders the reconstruction of anomalies in the frequency domain, which enlarges the reconstruction error disparity between anomaly and normality and facilitates anomaly detection; (iii) leveraging the sparsity and parallelism of frequency domain to enhance model efficiency. We theoretically and experimentally prove that using a strategically selected subset of Fourier bases can not only reduce computational overhead but is also profitable to distinguish anomalies, compared to using the complete spectrum. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate MACE's effectiveness in handling diverse normal patterns with a unified model and it achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering   (ICDE 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Transferable Time Series Classifier with Cross-Domain   Pre-training from Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12372v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in self-supervised pre-training (SSL) have significantly advanced the field of learning transferable time series representations, which can be very useful in enhancing the downstream task. Despite being effective, most existing works struggle to achieve cross-domain SSL pre-training, missing valuable opportunities to integrate patterns and features from different domains. The main challenge lies in the significant differences in the characteristics of time-series data across different domains, such as variations in the number of channels and temporal resolution scales. To address this challenge, we propose CrossTimeNet, a novel cross-domain SSL learning framework to learn transferable knowledge from various domains to largely benefit the target downstream task. One of the key characteristics of CrossTimeNet is the newly designed time series tokenization module, which could effectively convert the raw time series into a sequence of discrete tokens based on a reconstruction optimization process. Besides, we highlight that predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens can be very helpful for extracting informative patterns across different domains during SSL pre-training, which has been largely overlooked in past years. Furthermore, unlike previous works, our work treats the pre-training language model (PLM) as the initialization of the encoder network, investigating the feasibility of transferring the knowledge learned by the PLM to the time series area. Through these efforts, the path to cross-domain pre-training of a generic time series model can be effectively paved. We conduct extensive experiments in a real-world scenario across various time series classification domains. The experimental results clearly confirm CrossTimeNet's superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Time Series Classification with Multimodal Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12371v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the advancements of time series classification, scrutinizing previous studies, most existing methods adopt a common learning-to-classify paradigm - a time series classifier model tries to learn the relation between sequence inputs and target label encoded by one-hot distribution. Although effective, this paradigm conceals two inherent limitations: (1) encoding target categories with one-hot distribution fails to reflect the comparability and similarity between labels, and (2) it is very difficult to learn transferable model across domains, which greatly hinder the development of universal serving paradigm. In this work, we propose InstructTime, a novel attempt to reshape time series classification as a learning-to-generate paradigm. Relying on the powerful generative capacity of the pre-trained language model, the core idea is to formulate the classification of time series as a multimodal understanding task, in which both task-specific instructions and raw time series are treated as multimodal inputs while the label information is represented by texts. To accomplish this goal, three distinct designs are developed in the InstructTime. Firstly, a time series discretization module is designed to convert continuous time series into a sequence of hard tokens to solve the inconsistency issue across modal inputs. To solve the modality representation gap issue, for one thing, we introduce an alignment projected layer before feeding the transformed token of time series into language models. For another, we highlight the necessity of auto-regressive pre-training across domains, which can facilitate the transferability of the language model and boost the generalization performance. Extensive experiments are conducted over benchmark datasets, whose results uncover the superior performance of InstructTime and the potential for a universal foundation model in time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copula Conformal Prediction for Multi-step Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03281v4)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate uncertainty measurement is a key step to building robust and reliable machine learning systems. Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification algorithm popular for its ease of implementation, statistical coverage guarantees, and versatility for underlying forecasters. However, existing conformal prediction algorithms for time series are limited to single-step prediction without considering the temporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a Copula Conformal Prediction algorithm for multivariate, multi-step Time Series forecasting, CopulaCPTS. We prove that CopulaCPTS has finite sample validity guarantee. On several synthetic and real-world multivariate time series datasets, we show that CopulaCPTS produces more calibrated and sharp confidence intervals for multi-step prediction tasks than existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation of RKHS Functionals by Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12187v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the abundance of functional data such as time series and images, there has been a growing interest in integrating such data into neural networks and learning maps from function spaces to R (i.e., functionals). In this paper, we study the approximation of functionals on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS's) using neural networks. We establish the universality of the approximation of functionals on the RKHS's. Specifically, we derive explicit error bounds for those induced by inverse multiquadric, Gaussian, and Sobolev kernels. Moreover, we apply our findings to functional regression, proving that neural networks can accurately approximate the regression maps in generalized functional linear models. Existing works on functional learning require integration-type basis function expansions with a set of pre-specified basis functions. By leveraging the interpolating orthogonal projections in RKHS's, our proposed network is much simpler in that we use point evaluations to replace basis function expansions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting: Interpretability   and Feature Selection using Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16834v3)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series have many applications, from healthcare and meteorology to life science. Although deep learning models have shown excellent predictive performance for time series, they have been criticised for being "black-boxes" or non-interpretable. This paper proposes a novel modular neural network model for multivariate time series prediction that is interpretable by construction. A recurrent neural network learns the temporal dependencies in the data while an attention-based feature selection component selects the most relevant features and suppresses redundant features used in the learning of the temporal dependencies. A modular deep network is trained from the selected features independently to show the users how features influence outcomes, making the model interpretable. Experimental results show that this approach can outperform state-of-the-art interpretable Neural Additive Models (NAM) and variations thereof in both regression and classification of time series tasks, achieving a predictive performance that is comparable to the top non-interpretable methods for time series, LSTM and XGBoost.</p></details> |  |
