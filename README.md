| **[Predicting Future Change-points in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09485v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change-point detection and estimation procedures have been widely developed in the literature. However, commonly used approaches in change-point analysis have mainly been focusing on detecting change-points within an entire time series (off-line methods), or quickest detection of change-points in sequentially observed data (on-line methods). Both classes of methods are concerned with change-points that have already occurred. The arguably more important question of when future change-points may occur, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical model that describes the mechanism of change-point occurrence. Specifically, the model assumes a latent process in the form of a random walk driven by non-negative innovations, and an observed process which behaves differently when the latent process belongs to different regimes. By construction, an occurrence of a change-point is equivalent to hitting a regime threshold by the latent process. Therefore, by predicting when the latent process will hit the next regime threshold, future change-points can be forecasted. The probabilistic properties of the model such as stationarity and ergodicity are established. A composite likelihood-based approach is developed for parameter estimation and model selection. Moreover, we construct the predictor and prediction interval for future change points based on the estimated model.</p></details> | 37 pages, 4 figures |

A typical failure troubleshooting pipeline for microservices consists of two phases: anomaly detection and root cause analysis. While various existing works on root cause analysis require accurate anomaly detection, there is no guarantee of accurate estimation with anomaly detection techniques. Inaccurate anomaly detection results can significantly affect the root cause localization results. To address this challenge, we propose BARO, an end-to-end approach that integrates anomaly detection and root cause analysis for effectively troubleshooting failures in microservice systems. BARO leverages the Multivariate Bayesian Online Change Point Detection technique to model the dependency within multivariate time-series metrics data, enabling it to detect anomalies more accurately. BARO also incorporates a novel nonparametric statistical hypothesis testing technique for robustly identifying root causes, which is less sensitive to the accuracy of anomaly detection compared to existing works. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark microservice systems demonstrate that BARO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both anomaly detection and root cause analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to FSE'24</p></details> |
| **[TimeX++: Learning Time-Series Explanations with Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09308v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining deep learning models operating on time series data is crucial in various applications of interest which require interpretable and transparent insights from time series signals. In this work, we investigate this problem from an information theoretic perspective and show that most existing measures of explainability may suffer from trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. We further present TimeX++, a novel explanation framework that leverages a parametric network to produce explanation-embedded instances that are both in-distributed and label-preserving. We evaluate TimeX++ on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing its performance against leading baselines, and validate its practical efficacy through case studies in a real-world environmental application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that TimeX++ outperforms baselines across all datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

| **[Easy attention: A simple attention mechanism for temporal predictions with transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12874v3)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used for temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention mechanism called easy attention which we demonstrate in time-series reconstruction and prediction. While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[MileBench: Benchmarking MLLMs in Long Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18532v2)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the advancements and impressive performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world, long-context, and multi-image tasks is unclear due to the benchmarks' limited scope. Existing benchmarks often focus on single-image and short-text samples, and when assessing multi-image tasks, they either limit the image count or focus on specific task (e.g time-series captioning), potentially obscuring the performance challenges of MLLMs. To address these limitations, we introduce MileBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to test the MultImodal Long-contExt capabilities of MLLMs. This benchmark comprises not only multimodal long contexts, but also multiple tasks requiring both comprehension and generation. We establish two distinct evaluation sets, diagnostic and realistic, to systematically assess MLLMs' long-context adaptation capacity and their ability to complete tasks in long-context scenarios. Our experimental results, obtained from testing 22 models, revealed that while the closed-source GPT-4o outperforms others, most open-source MLLMs struggle in long-context situations. Interestingly, the performance gap tends to widen with an increase in the number of images. We strongly encourage an intensification of research efforts towards enhancing MLLMs' long-context capabilities, especially in scenarios involving multiple images.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures, 14 tables; We add results of GPT-4o in this version</p></details> |
| **[Conformalized Adaptive Forecasting of Heterogeneous Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09623v2)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new conformal method for generating simultaneous forecasting bands guaranteed to cover the entire path of a new random trajectory with sufficiently high probability. Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the standard sinusoidal positional encoding, our approach is based on solid mathematical grounds and has a guarantee of not losing information about the positional order of the input sequence. We show that the new encoding approach systematically improves the prediction performance in the time-series classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.17149</p></details> |
| **[Rumor Forwarding Prediction Model Based on Uncertain Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08493v2)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of rumors in social media is mainly caused by individual retweets. This paper applies uncertainty time series analysis (UTSA) to analyze a rumor retweeting behavior on Weibo. First, the rumor forwarding is modeled using uncertain time series, including order selection, parameter estimation, residual analysis, uncertainty hypothesis testing and forecast, and the validity of using uncertain time series analysis is further supported by analyzing the characteristics of the residual plot. The experimental results show that the uncertain time series can better predict the next stage of rumor forwarding. The results of the study have important practical significance for rumor management and the management of social media information dissemination.</p></details> | 11 pages,3 figures |
| **[Properties of stationary cyclical processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08907v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper investigates the theoretical properties of zero-mean stationary time series with cyclical components, admitting the representation $y_t=\alpha_t \cos \lambda t + \beta_t \sin \lambda t$, with $\lambda \in (0,\pi]$ and $[\alpha_t\,\, \beta_t]$ following some bivariate process. We diagnose that in the extant literature on cyclic time series, a prevalent assumption of Gaussianity for $[\alpha_t\,\, \beta_t]$ imposes inadvertently a severe restriction on the amplitude of the process. Moreover, it is shown that other common distributions may suffer from either similar defects or fail to guarantee the stationarity of $y_t$. To address both of the issues, we propose to introduce a direct stochastic modulation of the amplitude and phase shift in an almost periodic function. We prove that this novel approach may lead, in general, to a stationary (up to any order) time series, and specifically, to a zero-mean stationary time series featuring cyclicity, with a pseudo-cyclical autocovariance function that may even decay at a very slow rate. The proposed process fills an important gap in this type of models and allows for flexible modeling of amplitude and phase shift.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08790v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to time series forecasting, leveraging their adaptive activation functions for enhanced predictive modeling. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs replace traditional linear weights with spline-parametrized univariate functions, allowing them to learn activation patterns dynamically. We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGCformer: Deep Graph Clustering Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08440v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting tasks are usually conducted in a channel-dependent (CD) way since it can incorporate more variable-relevant information. However, it may also involve a lot of irrelevant variables, and this even leads to worse performance than the channel-independent (CI) strategy. This paper combines the strengths of both strategies and proposes the Deep Graph Clustering Transformer (DGCformer) for multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, it first groups these relevant variables by a graph convolutional network integrated with an autoencoder, and a former-latter masked self-attention mechanism is then considered with the CD strategy being applied to each group of variables while the CI one for different groups. Extensive experimental results on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art models, and our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution Network for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05499v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of long-term time series has important applications for decision making and planning. However, it remains challenging to capture the long-term dependencies in time series data. To better extract long-term dependencies, We propose Multi Scale Dilated Convolution Network (MSDCN), a method that utilizes a shallow dilated convolution architecture to capture the period and trend characteristics of long time series. We design different convolution blocks with exponentially growing dilations and varying kernel sizes to sample time series data at different scales. Furthermore, we utilize traditional autoregressive model to capture the linear relationships within the data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on eight challenging long-term time series forecasting benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the prior state-of-the-art approaches and shows significant inference speed improvements compared to several strong baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An algorithmic framework for the optimization of deep neural networks architectures and hyperparameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12797v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an algorithmic framework to automatically generate efficient deep neural networks and optimize their associated hyperparameters. The framework is based on evolving directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), defining a more flexible search space than the existing ones in the literature. It allows mixtures of different classical operations: convolutions, recurrences and dense layers, but also more newfangled operations such as self-attention. Based on this search space we propose neighbourhood and evolution search operators to optimize both the architecture and hyper-parameters of our networks. These search operators can be used with any metaheuristic capable of handling mixed search spaces. We tested our algorithmic framework with an evolutionary algorithm on a time series prediction benchmark. The results demonstrate that our framework was able to find models outperforming the established baseline on numerous datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIER: A Novel Experience Replay Approach with Causal Inference in Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08380v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the training process of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), agents require repetitive interactions with the environment. With an increase in training volume and model complexity, it is still a challenging problem to enhance data utilization and explainability of DRL training. This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on the temporal correlations within the time dimension of time series. We propose a novel approach to segment multivariate time series into meaningful subsequences and represent the time series based on these subsequences. Furthermore, the subsequences are employed for causal inference to identify fundamental causal factors that significantly impact training outcomes. We design a module to provide feedback on the causality during DRL training. Several experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in common environments, confirming its ability to enhance the effectiveness of DRL training and impart a certain level of explainability to the training process. Additionally, we extended our approach with priority experience replay algorithm, and experimental results demonstrate the continued effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Free Unsupervised Anomaly detection framework in multivariate time-series of industrial dynamical systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08349v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a new model-free anomaly detection framework is proposed for time-series induced by industrial dynamical systems. The framework lies in the category of conventional approaches which enable appealing features such as, a fast learning with reduced amount of learning data, a reduced memory, a high potential for explainability as well as easiness of incremental learning mechanism to incorporate operator feedback after an alarm is raised an analyzed. All these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solution by industry but they are rarely considered in the comparisons between competing methods which generally exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the case in industrial time-series. Two examples are given to assess the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[M3H: Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18975v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence holds promise to fundamentally enhance healthcare. Developing an integrated many-to-many framework leveraging multimodal data for multiple tasks is essential to unifying modern medicine. We introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning from tabular, time-series, language, and vision data for supervised binary/multiclass classification, regression, and unsupervised clustering. M3H encompasses an unprecedented range of medical tasks and problem domains and consistently outperforms traditional single-task models by on average 11.6% across 40 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments, three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task. It features a novel attention mechanism balancing self-exploitation (learning source-task), and cross-exploration (learning cross-tasks), and offers explainability through a proposed TIM score, shedding light on the dynamics of task learning interdependencies. Its adaptable architecture supports easy customization and integration of new data modalities and tasks, establishing it as a robust, scalable solution for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOMENT: A Family of Open Time-series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03885v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time series analysis. Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024.

| **[How Inverse Conditional Flows Can Serve as a Substitute for Distributional Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05429v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression, are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.</p></details> | Accepted at UAI 2024 |
| **[Comparative Study of Bitcoin Price Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08089v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of stock prices has been a crucial and challenging task, especially in the case of highly volatile digital currencies such as Bitcoin. This research examineS the potential of using neural network models, namely LSTMs and GRUs, to forecast Bitcoin's price movements. We employ five-fold cross-validation to enhance generalization and utilize L2 regularization to reduce overfitting and noise. Our study demonstrates that the GRUs models offer better accuracy than LSTMs model for predicting Bitcoin's price. Specifically, the GRU model has an MSE of 4.67, while the LSTM model has an MSE of 6.25 when compared to the actual prices in the test set data. This finding indicates that GRU models are better equipped to process sequential data with long-term dependencies, a characteristic of financial time series data such as Bitcoin prices. In summary, our results provide valuable insights into the potential of neural network models for accurate Bitcoin price prediction and emphasize the importance of employing appropriate regularization techniques to enhance model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMAFD: An Interpretable Multi-stage Approach to Flood Detection from time series Multispectral Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07916v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address two critical challenges in the domain of flood detection: the computational expense of large-scale time series change detection and the lack of interpretable decision-making processes on explainable AI (XAI). To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed. It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process. The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation. It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation. The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making. Our contributions are two folder. First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection. Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations. The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval. For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing for jumps in processes with integral fractional part and jump-robust inference on the Hurst exponent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01751v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop and investigate a test for jumps based on high-frequency observations of a fractional process with an additive jump component. The Hurst exponent of the fractional process is unknown. The asymptotic theory under infill asymptotics builds upon extreme value theory for weakly dependent, stationary time series and extends techniques for the semimartingale case from the literature. It is shown that the statistic on which the test is based on weakly converges to a Gumbel distribution under the null hypothesis of no jumps. We prove consistency under the alternative hypothesis when there are jumps. Moreover, we establish convergence rates for local alternatives and consistent estimation of jump times. In the process, we show that inference on the Hurst exponent of a rough fractional process is robust with respect to jumps. This provides an important insight for the growing literature on rough volatility. We demonstrate sound finite-sample properties in a simulation study and showcase the applicability of our methods in an empirical example with a time series of volatilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Embedded Time-Series Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15730v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) should produce synthetic data that fits the underlying distribution of the data being modeled. For real valued time-series data, this implies the need to simultaneously capture the static distribution of the data, but also the full temporal distribution of the data for any potential time horizon. This temporal element produces a more complex problem that can potentially leave current solutions under-constrained, unstable during training, or prone to varying degrees of mode collapse. In FETSGAN, entire sequences are translated directly to the generator's sampling space using a seq2seq style adversarial auto encoder (AAE), where adversarial training is used to match the training distribution in both the feature space and the lower dimensional sampling space. This additional constraint provides a loose assurance that the temporal distribution of the synthetic samples will not collapse. In addition, the First Above Threshold (FAT) operator is introduced to supplement the reconstruction of encoded sequences, which improves training stability and the overall quality of the synthetic data being generated. These novel contributions demonstrate a significant improvement to the current state of the art for adversarial learners in qualitative measures of temporal similarity and quantitative predictive ability of data generated through FETSGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final Manuscript.

| **[Generative Modeling of Regular and Irregular Time Series Data via Koopman VAEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02619v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series data is important for many engineering and scientific applications. Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Unlike conventional applications of decision trees that forecast time series directly, Hyper-Trees are designed to learn the parameters of a target time series model. Our framework leverages the gradient-based nature of boosted trees, which allows us to extend the concept of Hyper-Networks to Hyper-Trees and to induce a time-series inductive bias to tree models. By relating the parameters of a target time series model to features, Hyper-Trees address the challenge of parameter non-stationarity and enable tree-based forecasts to extend beyond their initial training range. With our research, we aim to explore the effectiveness of Hyper-Trees across various forecasting scenarios and to expand the application of gradient boosted decision trees past their conventional use in time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forec...</summary><p>Forecasting, Gradient Boosting, Hyper-Networks, LightGBM, Parameter Non-Stationarity, Time Series, XGBoost</p></details> |

Leveraging the power of Association Rule Mining (ARM), this research endeavors to unravel the underlying dynamics of collaboration among citizen scientists. By meticulously quantifying tag associations and scrutinizing their temporal dynamics, the study provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how non-experts collaborate to generate valuable scientific insights. Furthermore, this investigation extends its purview to examine the phenomenon of ideological convergence within online citizen science knowledge production. To accomplish this, a novel measurement algorithm, based on the Mann-Kendall Trend Test, is introduced. This innovative approach sheds illuminating light on the dynamics of collaborative knowledge production, revealing both the vast opportunities and daunting challenges inherent in leveraging non-expert contributions for scientific research endeavors. Notably, the study uncovers a robust pattern of convergence in ideology, employing both the newly proposed convergence testing method and the traditional approach based on the stationarity of time series data. This groundbreaking discovery holds significant implications for understanding the dynamics of online citizen science communities and underscores the crucial role played by non-experts in shaping the scientific landscape of the digital age. Ultimately, this study contributes significantly to our understanding of online citizen science communities, highlighting their potential to harness collective intelligence for tackling complex scientific tasks and enriching our comprehension of collaborative knowledge production processes in the digital age.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepHYDRA: Resource-Efficient Time-Series Anomaly Detection in Dynamically-Configured Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07749v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in distributed systems such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters is vital for early fault detection, performance optimisation, security monitoring, reliability in general but also operational insights. Deep Neural Networks have seen successful use in detecting long-term anomalies in multidimensional data, originating for instance from industrial or medical systems, or weather prediction. A downside of such methods is that they require a static input size, or lose data through cropping, sampling, or other dimensionality reduction methods, making deployment on systems with variability on monitored data channels, such as computing clusters difficult. To address these problems, we present DeepHYDRA (Deep Hybrid DBSCAN/Reduction-Based Anomaly Detection) which combines DBSCAN and learning-based anomaly detection. DBSCAN clustering is used to find point anomalies in time-series data, mitigating the risk of missing outliers through loss of information when reducing input data to a fixed number of channels. A deep learning-based time-series anomaly detection method is then applied to the reduced data in order to identify long-term outliers. This hybrid approach reduces the chances of missing anomalies that might be made indistinguishable from normal data by the reduction process, and likewise enables the algorithm to be scalable and tolerate partial system failures while retaining its detection capabilities. Using a subset of the well-known SMD dataset family, a modified variant of the Eclipse dataset, as well as an in-house dataset with a large variability in active data channels, made publicly available with this work, we furthermore analyse computational intensity, memory footprint, and activation counts. DeepHYDRA is shown to reliably detect different types of anomalies in both large and complex datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we establish the central limit theorem (CLT) for spiked eigenvalues of high-dimensional sample autocovariance matrices, which are developed under general conditions. The spiked eigenvalues are allowed to go to infinity in a flexible way without restrictions in divergence order. Moreover, the number of spiked eigenvalues and the time lag of the autocovariance matrix under this study could be either fixed or tending to infinity when the dimension p and the time length T go to infinity together. As a further statistical application, a novel autocovariance test is proposed to detect the equivalence of spiked eigenvalues for two high-dimensional time series. Various simulation studies are illustrated to justify the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a hierarchical clustering approach based on the autocovariance test is constructed and applied to clustering mortality data from multiple countries.</p></details> |  |

Especially machine learning shows great potential for complex tasks such as time series classification, usually at the cost of transparency and comprehensibility. This leads to a lack of trust by humans and thus hinders its active usage. Explainable artificial intelligence tries to close this gap by providing insight into the decision-making process, the actual usefulness of its different methods is however unclear. This paper proposes a user study based evaluation of the explanation method Grad-CAM with application to a neural network for the classification of breaths in time series neonatal ventilation data. We present the perceived usefulness of the explainability method by different stakeholders, exposing the difficulty to achieve actual transparency and the wish for more in-depth explanations by many of the participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2024 The authors.

Traditional $k$-means clustering is commonly used for categorizing regional variability of sea level, however, its results are not robust against a number of factors. This study analyzed fourteen datasets of monthly sea level in fourteen shoreline regions of Peninsular Malaysia. We applied a hybridization of clustering technique to analyze data categorization and topological data analysis method to enhance the performance of our clustering analysis. Specifically, our approach utilized the persistent homology and $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering. The fourteen data sets from fourteen tide gauge stations were categorized in classes based on a prior categorization that was determined by topological information, and the probability of data points that belong to certain groups that is yielded by $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering. Our results demonstrated that our method significantly improves the performance of traditional clustering techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are some mistakes in the submission, and it needs major revision</p></details> |

The scarcity of labeled data for such tasks has increased the attention towards unsupervised learning methods. These approaches, often relying solely on reconstruction error, typically fail to detect subtle anomalies in complex datasets. To address this, we introduce RESTAD, an adaptation of the Transformer model by incorporating a layer of Radial Basis Function (RBF) neurons within its architecture. This layer fits a non-parametric density in the latent representation, such that a high RBF output indicates similarity with predominantly normal training data. RESTAD integrates the RBF similarity scores with the reconstruction errors to increase sensitivity to anomalies. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that RESTAD outperforms various established baselines across multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review</p></details> |

Although stationary electricity-price forecasting techniques have received considerable attention, research on non-stationary methods is comparatively scarce, despite the common prevalence of non-stationary features in electricity markets. Specifically, existing non-stationary techniques will often aim to address individual non-stationary features in isolation, leaving aside the exploration of concurrent multiple non-stationary effects. Our overarching objective here is the formulation of a framework to systematically model and forecast non-stationary electricity-price time series, encompassing the broader scope of non-stationary behavior. For this purpose we develop a data-driven model that combines an N-dimensional Langevin equation (LE) with a neural-ordinary differential equation (NODE). The LE captures fine-grained details of the electricity-price behavior in stationary regimes but is inadequate for non-stationary conditions. To overcome this inherent limitation, we adopt a NODE approach to learn, and at the same time predict, the difference between the actual electricity-price time series and the simulated price trajectories generated by the LE. By learning this difference, the NODE reconstructs the non-stationary components of the time series that the LE is not able to capture. We exemplify the effectiveness of our framework using the Spanish electricity day-ahead market as a prototypical case study. Our findings reveal that the NODE nicely complements the LE, providing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stationary and non-stationary electricity-price behavior. The framework's dependability and robustness is demonstrated through different non-stationary scenarios by comparing it against a range of basic naive methods.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

However, the difficulty of extracting physical understanding from ML-based models complicates their utility for enhancing scientific knowledge regarding system structure and function. Here, we propose a physically-interpretable Mass Conserving Perceptron (MCP) as a way to bridge the gap between PC-based and ML-based modeling approaches. The MCP exploits the inherent isomorphism between the directed graph structures underlying both PC models and GRNNs to explicitly represent the mass-conserving nature of physical processes while enabling the functional nature of such processes to be directly learned (in an interpretable manner) from available data using off-the-shelf ML technology. As a proof of concept, we investigate the functional expressivity (capacity) of the MCP, explore its ability to parsimoniously represent the rainfall-runoff (RR) dynamics of the Leaf River Basin, and demonstrate its utility for scientific hypothesis testing. To conclude, we discuss extensions of the concept to enable ML-based physical-conceptual representation of the coupled nature of mass-energy-information flows through geoscientific systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>68 pa...</summary><p>68 pages, 7 figures in the main text, 10 figures, and 10 tables in the supplementary materials</p></details> |

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Multi-Frequency Partial Correlation Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15756v2)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the large research effort devoted to learning dependencies between time series, the state of the art still faces a major limitation: existing methods learn partial correlations but fail to discriminate across distinct frequency bands. Motivated by many applications in which this differentiation is pivotal, we overcome this limitation by learning a block-sparse, frequency-dependent, partial correlation graph, in which layers correspond to different frequency bands, and partial correlations can occur over just a few layers. To this aim, we formulate and solve two nonconvex learning problems: the first has a closed-form solution and is suitable when there is prior knowledge about the number of partial correlations; the second hinges on an iterative solution based on successive convex approximation, and is effective for the general case where no prior knowledge is available. Numerical results on synthetic data show that the proposed methods outperform the current state of the art. Finally, the analysis of financial time series confirms that partial correlations exist only within a few frequency bands, underscoring how our methods enable the gaining of valuable insights that would be undetected without discriminating along the frequency domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

Our paper presents a critical analysis of the status quo in TAD, revealing the misleading track of current research and highlighting problematic methods, and evaluation practices. Our position advocates for a shift in focus from solely pursuing novel model designs to improving benchmarking practices, creating non-trivial datasets, and critically evaluating the utility of complex methods against simpler baselines. Our findings demonstrate the need for rigorous evaluation protocols, the creation of simple baselines, and the revelation that state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection models effectively learn linear mappings. These findings suggest the need for more exploration and development of simple and interpretable TAD methods. The increment of model complexity in the state-of-the-art deep-learning based models unfortunately offers very little improvement. We offer insights and suggestions for the field to move forward.

| **[Factor Strength Estimation in Vector and Matrix Time Series Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07294v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most factor modelling research in vector or matrix-valued time series assume all factors are pervasive/strong and leave weaker factors and their corresponding series to the noise. Weaker factors can in fact be important to a group of observed variables, for instance a sector factor in a large portfolio of stocks may only affect particular sectors, but can be important both in interpretations and predictions for those stocks. While more recent factor modelling researches do consider ``local'' factors which are weak factors with sparse corresponding factor loadings, there are real data examples in the literature where factors are weak because of weak influence on most/all observed variables, so that the corresponding factor loadings are not sparse (non-local). As a first in the literature, we propose estimators of factor strengths for both local and non-local weak factors, and prove their consistency with rates of convergence spelt out for both vector and matrix-valued time series factor models. Factor strength has an important indication in what estimation procedure of factor models to follow, as well as the estimation accuracy of various estimators (Chen and Lam, 2024). Simulation results show that our estimators have good performance in recovering the true factor strengths, and an analysis on the NYC taxi traffic data indicates the existence of weak factors in the data which may not be localized.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel Three Pass Regression Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07292v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We forecast a single time series using a high-dimensional set of predictors. When these predictors share common underlying dynamics, an approximate latent factor model provides a powerful characterization of their co-movements Bai(2003). These latent factors succinctly summarize the data and can also be used for prediction, alleviating the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional prediction exercises, see Stock & Watson (2002a). However, forecasting using these latent factors suffers from two potential drawbacks. First, not all pervasive factors among the set of predictors may be relevant, and using all of them can lead to inefficient forecasts. The second shortcoming is the assumption of linear dependence of predictors on the underlying factors. The first issue can be addressed by using some form of supervision, which leads to the omission of irrelevant information. One example is the three-pass regression filter proposed by Kelly & Pruitt (2015). We extend their framework to cases where the form of dependence might be nonlinear by developing a new estimator, which we refer to as the Kernel Three-Pass Regression Filter (K3PRF). This alleviates the aforementioned second shortcoming. The estimator is computationally efficient and performs well empirically. The short-term performance matches or exceeds that of established models, while the long-term performance shows significant improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Forecasting, High dimension, Approximate factor model, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space, Three-pass regression filter</p></details> |
| **[Context Neural Networks: A Scalable Multivariate Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07117v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series often exhibit complex interdependencies that cannot be captured in isolation. Global models that model past data from multiple related time series globally while producing series-specific forecasts locally are now common. However, their forecasts for each individual series remain isolated, failing to account for the current state of its neighbouring series. Multivariate models like multivariate attention and graph neural networks can explicitly incorporate inter-series information, thus addressing the shortcomings of global models. However, these techniques exhibit quadratic complexity per timestep, limiting scalability. This paper introduces the Context Neural Network, an efficient linear complexity approach for augmenting time series models with relevant contextual insights from neighbouring time series without significant computational overhead. The proposed method enriches predictive models by providing the target series with real-time information from its neighbours, addressing the limitations of global models, yet remaining computationally tractable for large datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Modeling in the Reservoir Kernel Motif Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07045v1)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a time series prediction method based on the kernel view of linear reservoirs. In particular, the time series motifs of the reservoir kernel are used as representational basis on which general readouts are constructed. We provide a geometric interpretation of our approach shedding light on how our approach is related to the core reservoir models and in what way the two approaches differ. Empirical experiments then compare predictive performances of our suggested model with those of recent state-of-art transformer based models, as well as the established recurrent network model - LSTM. The experiments are performed on both univariate and multivariate time series and with a variety of prediction horizons. Rather surprisingly we show that even when linear readout is employed, our method has the capacity to outperform transformer models on univariate time series and attain competitive results on multivariate benchmark datasets. We conclude that simple models with easily controllable capacity but capturing enough memory and subsequence structure can outperform potentially over-complicated deep learning models. This does not mean that reservoir motif based models are preferable to other more complex alternatives - rather, when introducing a new complex time series model one should employ as a sanity check simple, but potentially powerful alternatives/baselines such as reservoir models or the models introduced here.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Through a comprehensive data-driven investigation, this paper explores the types of news that captivate public interest in geoengineering. We delved into 30,773 English-language news articles from the BBC and the New York Times, combined with Google Trends data spanning 2018 to 2022, to explore how public interest in geoengineering fluctuates in response to news coverage of broader climate issues. Using BERT-based topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and time-series regression models, we found that positive sentiment in energy-related news serves as a good predictor of heightened public interest in geoengineering, a trend that persists over time. Our findings suggest that public engagement with geoengineering and climate action is not uniform, with some topics being more potent in shaping interest over time, such as climate news related to energy, disasters, and politics. Understanding these patterns is crucial for scientists, policymakers, and educators aiming to craft effective strategies for engaging with the public and fostering dialogue around emerging climate technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 page, 6 main figures and SI</p></details> |

A well-established paradigm in AI-driven time series prediction is injecting physical knowledge into neural networks through signal decomposition methods, and sustaining progress in numerous scenarios has been reported. However, we uncover non-negligible evidence that challenges the effectiveness of signal decomposition in AI-based time series prediction. We confirm that improper dataset processing with subtle future label leakage is unfortunately widely adopted, possibly yielding abnormally superior but misleading results. By processing data in a strictly causal way without any future information, the effectiveness of additional decomposed signals diminishes. Our work probably identifies an ingrained and universal error in time series modeling, and the de facto progress in relevant areas is expected to be revisited and calibrated to prevent future scientific detours and minimize practical losses.</p></details> |  |

This methodology can be adapted to stationary time series, yet inferring causal relationships from nonstationary time series remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a new class of restricted SCM, via a time-varying filter and stationary noise, and exploit the asymmetry from nonstationarity for causal identification in both bivariate and network settings. We propose efficient procedures by leveraging powerful estimates of the bivariate evolutionary spectra for slowly varying processes. Various synthetic and real datasets that involve high-order and non-smooth filters are evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2012.13025</p></details> |

Forced migration, including refugee and asylum seekers, plays an important role in overall migration patterns, but is notoriously difficult to forecast. We propose a modeling pipeline based on Bayesian hierarchical time-series modeling for projecting combined refugee and asylum seeker populations by country of origin using data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR). Our approach is based on a conceptual model of refugee crises following growth and decline phases, separated by a peak. The growth and decline phases are modeled by logistic growth and decline through an interrupted logistic process model. We evaluate our method through a set of validation exercises that show it has good performance for forecasts at 1, 5, and 10 year horizons, and we present projections for 35 countries with ongoing refugee crises.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

In particular, for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate direct solves with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</p></details> |  |

Graph theory provides a unifying framework to model such datasets and enables the use of powerful tools that can help analyze, visualize, and extract value from data. In this work, we present PlasmoData.jl, an open-source, Julia framework that uses concepts of graph theory to facilitate the modeling and analysis of complex datasets. The core of our framework is a general data modeling abstraction, which we call a DataGraph. We show how the abstraction and software implementation can be used to represent diverse data objects as graphs and to enable the use of tools from topology, graph theory, and machine learning (e.g., graph neural networks) to conduct a variety of tasks. We illustrate the versatility of the framework by using real datasets: i) an image classification problem using topological data analysis to extract features from the graph model to train machine learning models; ii) a disease outbreak problem where we model multivariate time series as graphs to detect abnormal events; and iii) a technology pathway analysis problem where we highlight how we can use graphs to navigate connectivity. Our discussion also highlights how PlasmoData.jl leverages native Julia capabilities to enable compact syntax, scalable computations, and interfaces with diverse packages.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 18 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

A solution to this problem can be the periodic monitoring over critical areas, like coastal region with heavy industrial activity (i.e., ship-buildings) or areas where a disaster (i.e., oil-spill) has occurred. Today there are several Earth and non-Earth Observation data available from several data providers. These data are huge in size and usually it is needed to combine several data from multiple sources (i.e., data with format differences) for a more effective evaluation. For addressing these issues, this work proposes the Ocean-DC framework as a solution in data harmonization and homogenization. A strong advantage of this Data Cube implementation is the generation of a single NetCDF product that contains Earth Observation data of several data types (i.e., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Ocean-DC implementation, it is examined a case study of an oil-spill in Saronic gulf in September of 2017. The generated 4D Data Cube considers both Landsat-8,9 and Sentinel-2 products for a time-series analysis, before, during, and after the oil-spill event. The Ocean-DC framework successfully generated a NetCDF product, containing all the necessary remote sensing products for monitoring the oil-spill disaster in the Saronic gulf.</p></details> |  |

To meet these performance demands, we propose a novel backbone from the perspective of information fusion. Introducing the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module and the Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN), based on evidence theory, allows us to achieve superior performance. On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection. TEFN is not a model that achieves the ultimate in single aspect, but a model that balances performance, accuracy, stability, and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing metrics often fail to capture the complex, multidimensional nature of time series data, limiting their effectiveness and application. This paper introduces the Structured Similarity Index Measure for Time Series (TS3IM), a novel approach inspired by the success of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) in image analysis, tailored to address these limitations by assessing structural similarity in time series. TS3IM evaluates multiple dimensions of similarity-trend, variability, and structural integrity-offering a more nuanced and comprehensive measure. This metric represents a significant leap forward, providing a robust tool for analyzing temporal data and offering more accurate and comprehensive sequence analysis and decision support in fields such as monitoring power consumption, analyzing traffic flow, and adversarial recognition. Our extensive experimental results also show that compared with traditional methods that rely heavily on computational correlation, TS3IM is 1.87 times more similar to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in evaluation results and improves by more than 50% in adversarial recognition.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Forecasting high-dimensional functional time series with dual-factor structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04146v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a dual-factor model for high-dimensional functional time series (HDFTS) that considers multiple populations. The HDFTS is first decomposed into a collection of functional time series (FTS) in a lower dimension and a group of population-specific basis functions. The system of basis functions describes cross-sectional heterogeneity, while the reduced-dimension FTS retains most of the information common to multiple populations. The low-dimensional FTS is further decomposed into a product of common functional loadings and a matrix-valued time series that contains the most temporal dynamics embedded in the original HDFTS. The proposed general-form dual-factor structure is connected to several commonly used functional factor models. We demonstrate the finite-sample performances of the proposed method in recovering cross-sectional basis functions and extracting common features using simulated HDFTS. An empirical study shows that the proposed model produces more accurate point and interval forecasts for subnational age-specific mortality rates in Japan. The financial benefits associated with the improved mortality forecasts are translated into a life annuity pricing scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Optimization of Sample Entropy Hyperparameters for Short Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06112v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the complexity and irregularity of time series data is a primary pursuit across various data-scientific disciplines. Sample entropy (SampEn) is a widely adopted metric for this purpose, but its reliability is sensitive to the choice of its hyperparameters, the embedding dimension $(m)$ and the similarity radius $(r)$, especially for short-duration signals. This paper presents a novel methodology that addresses this challenge. We introduce a Bayesian optimization framework, integrated with a bootstrap-based variance estimator tailored for short signals, to simultaneously and optimally select the values of $m$ and $r$ for reliable SampEn estimation. Through validation on synthetic signal experiments, our approach outperformed existing benchmarks. It achieved a 60 to 90% reduction in relative error for estimating SampEn variance and a 22 to 45% decrease in relative mean squared error for SampEn estimation itself ($p \leq 0.043$). Applying our method to publicly available short-signal benchmarks yielded promising results. Unlike existing competitors, our approach was the only one to successfully identify known entropy differences across all signal sets ($p \leq 0.042$). Additionally, we introduce "EristroPy," an open-source Python package that implements our proposed optimization framework for SampEn hyperparameter selection. This work holds potential for applications where accurate estimation of entropy from short-duration signals is paramount.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However, they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiority in imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering.

The Black-Scholes Equation is a Parabolic Partial Differential Equation which provides an option pricing model. The present work proposes an approach based on Neural Networks to solve the Black-Scholes Equations. Real-world data from the stock options market were used as the initial boundary to solve the Black-Scholes Equation. In particular, times series of call options prices of Brazilian companies Petrobras and Vale were employed. The results indicate that the network can learn to solve the Black-Sholes Equation for a specific real-world stock options time series. The experimental results showed that the Neural network option pricing based on the Black-Sholes Equation solution can reach an option pricing forecasting more accurate than the traditional Black-Sholes analytical solutions. The experimental results making it possible to use this methodology to make short-term call option price forecasts in options markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Ferry Passenger Flow Using Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02098v3)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent studies related to Neural Networks being used on different forecasting and time series investigations, this study aims to expand these contexts to ferry passenger traffic. The primary objective of the study is to investigate and evaluate an LSTM-based Neural Networks' capability to forecast ferry passengers of two ports in the Philippines. The proposed model's fitting and evaluation of the passenger flow forecasting of the two ports is based on monthly passenger traffic from 2016 to 2022 data that was acquired from the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA). This work uses Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as its primary metric to evaluate the model's forecasting capability. The proposed LSTM-based Neural Networks model achieved 72% forecasting accuracy to the Batangas port ferry passenger data and 74% forecasting accuracy to the Mindoro port ferry passenger data. Using Keras and Scikit-learn Python libraries, this work concludes a reasonable forecasting performance of the presented LSTM model. Aside from these notable findings, this study also recommends further investigation and studies on employing other statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods on forecasting ferry passenger flows.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose T-Rep, a self-supervised method to learn time series representations at a timestep granularity. T-Rep learns vector embeddings of time alongside its feature extractor, to extract temporal features such as trend, periodicity, or distribution shifts from the signal. These time-embeddings are leveraged in pretext tasks, to incorporate smooth and fine-grained temporal dependencies in the representations, as well as reinforce robustness to missing data. We evaluate T-Rep on downstream classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks. It is compared to existing self-supervised algorithms for time series, which it outperforms in all three tasks. We test T-Rep in missing data regimes, where it proves more resilient than its counterparts. Finally, we provide latent space visualisation experiments, highlighting the interpretability of the learned representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, directly cascading existing models together tends to introduce significant interference between tasks and reduce video clarity because the interaction space is limited to the low-level semantic RGB space. To address this issue, we propose an innovative unified framework, SwapTalk, which accomplishes both face swapping and lip synchronization tasks in the same latent space. Referring to recent work on face generation, we choose the VQ-embedding space due to its excellent editability and fidelity performance. To enhance the framework's generalization capabilities for unseen identities, we incorporate identity loss during the training of the face swapping module. Additionally, we introduce expert discriminator supervision within the latent space during the training of the lip synchronization module to elevate synchronization quality. In the evaluation phase, previous studies primarily focused on the self-reconstruction of lip movements in synchronous audio-visual videos. To better approximate real-world applications, we expand the evaluation scope to asynchronous audio-video scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a novel identity consistency metric to more comprehensively assess the identity consistency over time series in generated facial videos. Experimental results on the HDTF demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing techniques in video quality, lip synchronization accuracy, face swapping fidelity, and identity consistency. Our demo is available at http://swaptalk.cc.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation and Inference for Change Points in Functional Regression Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05459v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the estimation and inference of change points under a functional linear regression model with changes in the slope function. We present a novel Functional Regression Binary Segmentation (FRBS) algorithm which is computationally efficient as well as achieving consistency in multiple change point detection. This algorithm utilizes the predictive power of piece-wise constant functional linear regression models in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework. We further propose a refinement step that improves the localization rate of the initial estimator output by FRBS, and derive asymptotic distributions of the refined estimators for two different regimes determined by the magnitude of a change. To facilitate the construction of confidence intervals for underlying change points based on the limiting distribution, we propose a consistent block-type long-run variance estimator. Our theoretical justifications for the proposed approach accommodate temporal dependence and heavy-tailedness in both the functional covariates and the measurement errors. Empirical effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and an application to the Standard and Poor's 500 index dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Invariant Time Series Forecasting in Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05430v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the transformative landscape of smart cities, the integration of the cutting-edge web technologies into time series forecasting presents a pivotal opportunity to enhance urban planning, sustainability, and economic growth. The advancement of deep neural networks has significantly improved forecasting performance. However, a notable challenge lies in the ability of these models to generalize well to out-of-distribution (OOD) time series data. The inherent spatial heterogeneity and domain shifts across urban environments create hurdles that prevent models from adapting and performing effectively in new urban environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a solution to derive invariant representations for more robust predictions under different urban environments instead of relying on spurious correlation across urban environments for better generalizability. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional time series forecasting models when tackling domain shifts in changing urban environments. The effectiveness and robustness of our method can be extended to diverse fields including climate modeling, urban planning, and smart city resource management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM WWW Companion 2024</p></details> |
| **[Bake off redux: a review and experimental evaluation of recent time series classification algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13029v3)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 2017, a research paper compared 18 Time Series Classification (TSC) algorithms on 85 datasets from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) archive. This study, commonly referred to as a `bake off', identified that only nine algorithms performed significantly better than the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Rotation Forest benchmarks that were used. The study categorised each algorithm by the type of feature they extract from time series data, forming a taxonomy of five main algorithm types. This categorisation of algorithms alongside the provision of code and accessible results for reproducibility has helped fuel an increase in popularity of the TSC field. Over six years have passed since this bake off, the UCR archive has expanded to 112 datasets and there have been a large number of new algorithms proposed. We revisit the bake off, seeing how each of the proposed categories have advanced since the original publication, and evaluate the performance of newer algorithms against the previous best-of-category using an expanded UCR archive. We extend the taxonomy to include three new categories to reflect recent developments. Alongside the originally proposed distance, interval, shapelet, dictionary and hybrid based algorithms, we compare newer convolution and feature based algorithms as well as deep learning approaches. We introduce 30 classification datasets either recently donated to the archive or reformatted to the TSC format, and use these to further evaluate the best performing algorithm from each category. Overall, we find that two recently proposed algorithms, Hydra+MultiROCKET and HIVE-COTEv2, perform significantly better than other approaches on both the current and new TSC problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Local to Unity Dynamic Tobit Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02599v3)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers highly persistent time series that are subject to nonlinearities in the form of censoring or an occasionally binding constraint, such as are regularly encountered in macroeconomics. A tractable candidate model for such series is the dynamic Tobit with a root local to unity. We show that this model generates a process that converges weakly to a non-standard limiting process, that is constrained (regulated) to be positive. Surprisingly, despite the presence of censoring, the OLS estimators of the model parameters are consistent. We show that this allows OLS-based inferences to be drawn on the overall persistence of the process (as measured by the sum of the autoregressive coefficients), and for the null of a unit root to be tested in the presence of censoring. Our simulations illustrate that the conventional ADF test substantially over-rejects when the data is generated by a dynamic Tobit with a unit root, whereas our proposed test is correctly sized. We provide an application of our methods to testing for a unit root in the Swiss franc / euro exchange rate, during a period when this was subject to an occasionally binding lower bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 7 figures; author accepted manuscript</p></details> |

| **[Concrete Dense Network for Long-Sequence Time Series Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05015v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series clustering is fundamental in data analysis for discovering temporal patterns. Despite recent advancements, learning cluster-friendly representations is still challenging, particularly with long and complex time series. Deep temporal clustering methods have been trying to integrate the canonical k-means into end-to-end training of neural networks but fall back on surrogate losses due to the non-differentiability of the hard cluster assignment, yielding sub-optimal solutions. In addition, the autoregressive strategy used in the state-of-the-art RNNs is subject to error accumulation and slow training, while recent research findings have revealed that Transformers are less effective due to time points lacking semantic meaning, to the permutation invariance of attention that discards the chronological order and high computation cost. In light of these observations, we present LoSTer which is a novel dense autoencoder architecture for the long-sequence time series clustering problem (LSTC) capable of optimizing the k-means objective via the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization trick and designed specifically for accurate and fast clustering of long time series. Extensive experiments on numerous benchmark datasets and two real-world applications prove the effectiveness of LoSTer over state-of-the-art RNNs and Transformer-based deep clustering methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Simultaneous identification of models and parameters of scientific simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15174v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many scientific models are composed of multiple discrete components, and scientists often make heuristic decisions about which components to include. Bayesian inference provides a mathematical framework for systematically selecting model components, but defining prior distributions over model components and developing associated inference schemes has been challenging. We approach this problem in a simulation-based inference framework: We define model priors over candidate components and, from model simulations, train neural networks to infer joint probability distributions over both model components and associated parameters. Our method, simulation-based model inference (SBMI), represents distributions over model components as a conditional mixture of multivariate binary distributions in the Grassmann formalism. SBMI can be applied to any compositional stochastic simulator without requiring likelihood evaluations. We evaluate SBMI on a simple time series model and on two scientific models from neuroscience, and show that it can discover multiple data-consistent model configurations, and that it reveals non-identifiable model components and parameters. SBMI provides a powerful tool for data-driven scientific inquiry which will allow scientists to identify essential model components and make uncertainty-informed modelling decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dependence-based fuzzy clustering of functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04904v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series clustering is an important data mining task with a wide variety of applications. While most methods focus on time series taking values on the real line, very few works consider functional time series. However, functional objects frequently arise in many fields, such as actuarial science, demography or finance. Functional time series are indexed collections of infinite-dimensional curves viewed as random elements taking values in a Hilbert space. In this paper, the problem of clustering functional time series is addressed. To this aim, a distance between functional time series is introduced and used to construct a clustering procedure. The metric relies on a measure of serial dependence which can be seen as a natural extension of the classical quantile autocorrelation function to the functional setting. Since the dynamics of the series may vary over time, we adopt a fuzzy approach, which enables the procedure to locate each series into several clusters with different membership degrees. The resulting algorithm can group series generated from similar stochastic processes, reaching accurate results with series coming from a broad variety of functional models and requiring minimum hyperparameter tuning. Several simulation experiments show that the method exhibits a high clustering accuracy besides being computationally efficient. Two interesting applications involving high-frequency financial time series and age-specific mortality improvement rates illustrate the potential of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2402.08687</p></details> |
| **[Explaining Clustering of Ecological Momentary Assessment Data Through Temporal and Feature Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04854v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of psychopathology, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies offer rich individual data on psychopathology-relevant variables (e.g., affect, behavior, etc) in real-time. EMA data is collected dynamically, represented as complex multivariate time series (MTS). Such information is crucial for a better understanding of mental disorders at the individual- and group-level. More specifically, clustering individuals in EMA data facilitates uncovering and studying the commonalities as well as variations of groups in the population. Nevertheless, since clustering is an unsupervised task and true EMA grouping is not commonly available, the evaluation of clustering is quite challenging. An important aspect of evaluation is clustering explainability. Thus, this paper proposes an attention-based interpretable framework to identify the important time-points and variables that play primary roles in distinguishing between clusters. A key part of this study is to examine ways to analyze, summarize, and interpret the attention weights as well as evaluate the patterns underlying the important segments of the data that differentiate across clusters. To evaluate the proposed approach, an EMA dataset of 187 individuals grouped in 3 clusters is used for analyzing the derived attention-based importance attributes. More specifically, this analysis provides the distinct characteristics at the cluster-, feature- and individual level. Such clustering explanations could be beneficial for generalizing existing concepts of mental disorders, discovering new insights, and even enhancing our knowledge at an individual level.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 12 figures, accepted at the World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence 2024</p></details> |
| **[Persistent homology of featured time series data and its applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04796v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have actively employed persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis technique, to analyze the topological information in time series data. Many successful studies have utilized graph representations of time series data for PH calculation. Given the diverse nature of time series data, it is crucial to have mechanisms that can adjust the PH calculations by incorporating domain-specific knowledge. In this context, we introduce a methodology that allows the adjustment of PH calculations by reflecting relevant domain knowledge in specific fields. We introduce the concept of featured time series, which is the pair of a time series augmented with specific features such as domain knowledge, and an influence vector that assigns a value to each feature to fine-tune the results of the PH. We then prove the stability theorem of the proposed method, which states that adjusting the influence vectors grants stability to the PH calculations. The proposed approach enables the tailored analysis of a time series based on the graph representation methodology, which makes it applicable to real-world domains. We consider two examples to verify the proposed method's advantages: anomaly detection of stock data and topological analysis of music data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Schrödinger Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04795v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

However, even high-performed models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights to detect such issues by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation with two time series datasets and user studies demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD in fostering a deeper human understanding, immediate corrective actions, and the reliability enhancement of models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is currently under review</p></details> |

| **[Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01404v5)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron & Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures.

This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. Notably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have attempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains.

Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series and adapting large language foundation models for time series. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis.

| **[Interpretable Vital Sign Forecasting with Model Agnostic Attention Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01714v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), representing a substantial medical challenge. The complexity of analyzing diverse vital signs to predict sepsis further aggravates this issue. While deep learning techniques have been advanced for early sepsis prediction, their 'black-box' nature obscures the internal logic, impairing interpretability in critical settings like ICUs. This paper introduces a framework that combines a deep learning model with an attention mechanism that highlights the critical time steps in the forecasting process, thus improving model interpretability and supporting clinical decision-making. We show that the attention mechanism could be adapted to various black box time series forecasting models such as N-HiTS and N-BEATS. Our method preserves the accuracy of conventional deep learning models while enhancing interpretability through attention-weight-generated heatmaps. We evaluated our model on the eICU-CRD dataset, focusing on forecasting vital signs for sepsis patients. We assessed its performance using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW) metrics. We explored the attention maps of N-HiTS and N-BEATS, examining the differences in their performance and identifying crucial factors influencing vital sign forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[An Autoregressive Model for Time Series of Random Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03778v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random variables in metric spaces indexed by time and observed at equally spaced time points are receiving increased attention due to their broad applicability. However, the absence of inherent structure in metric spaces has resulted in a literature that is predominantly non-parametric and model-free. To address this gap in models for time series of random objects, we introduce an adaptation of the classical linear autoregressive model tailored for data lying in a Hadamard space. The parameters of interest in this model are the Fr\'echet mean and a concentration parameter, both of which we prove can be consistently estimated from data. Additionally, we propose a test statistic and establish its asymptotic normality, thereby enabling hypothesis testing for the absence of serial dependence. Finally, we introduce a bootstrap procedure to obtain critical values for the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Theoretical results of our method, including the convergence of the estimators as well as the size and power of the test, are illustrated through simulations, and the utility of the model is demonstrated by an analysis of a time series of consumer inflation expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

The handwritten recognition is one of the useful area in real life use where both offline and online handwriting recognition are required. The chain code as feature extraction technique has shown significant results in literature and we have been able to use chain codes with graph neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception Without Vision for Trajectory Prediction: Ego Vehicle Dynamics as Scene Representation for Efficient Active Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09049v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the use of trajectory and dynamic state information for efficient data curation in autonomous driving machine learning tasks. We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[K-BMPC: Derivative-based Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive Control for Tractor-Trailer Trajectory Tracking with Unknown Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08707v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamics bring difficulties to controller design for control-affine systems such as tractor-trailer vehicles, especially when the parameters in the dynamics are unknown. To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

This article presents a trajectory planning and tracking framework designed for HyFCQs. In this framework, a terrestrial-aerial path-searching method with the crawling limitation of HyFCQs is proposed to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of trajectories. Additionally, a trajectory tracking method is proposed to address the challenges associated with the deformation time required by HyFCQs, which makes tracking hybrid trajectories at the junction between terrestrial and aerial segments difficult. Simulations and real-world experiments in diverse scenarios validate the exceptional performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Creating Geospatial Trajectories from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06130v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trafficking is a crime that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach models all driving scenario elements in a unified model: the position of new agents, their initial state, and their future motion trajectories. By predicting the distributions of all these variables from a shared global scenario embedding, we ensure that the final generated scenario is fully conditioned on all available context in the existing scene. Our unified modeling approach, combined with autoregressive agent injection, conditions the placement and motion trajectory of every new agent on all existing agents and their trajectories, leading to realistic scenarios with low collision rates. Our experimental results show that UniGen outperforms prior state of the art on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unscented Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02753v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans.

| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to support eventual deployment in security applications. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory.

| **[TrACT: A Training Dynamics Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Long-tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12538v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a safety critical task, autonomous driving requires accurate predictions of road users' future trajectories for safe motion planning, particularly under challenging conditions. Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01658v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Adaptive Informative Path Planning with Multimodal Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18374v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of an autonomous agent equipped with multiple sensors, each with different sensing precision and energy costs. The agent's goal is to explore the environment and gather information subject to its resource constraints in unknown, partially observable environments. The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50%. This approach was developed in support of rover path planning for the NASA VIPER Mission.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies</p></details> |

However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMEND: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Long-tailed Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08698v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrians' future motions is critical for intelligent driving systems. Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative model that infuses cognitive insights into trajectory prediction, focusing on perceived safety and dynamic decision-making. Distinct from traditional approaches, our model excels in analyzing interactions and behavior patterns in mixed autonomy traffic scenarios. It represents a significant leap forward, achieving marked performance improvements on several key datasets. Specifically, it surpasses existing benchmarks with gains of 16.2% on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), 27.4% on the Highway Drone (HighD), and 19.8% on the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset. Our proposed model shows exceptional proficiency in handling corner cases, essential for real-world applications. Moreover, its robustness is evident in scenarios with missing or limited data, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art baselines. This adaptability and resilience position our model as a viable tool for real-world autonomous driving systems, heralding a new standard in vehicle trajectory prediction for enhanced safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset. The proposed method demonstrates slight advantages in clustering and strong advantages in runtime, especially for long trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2023 IEEE-RAS 22nd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids).

| **[Neural Interaction Energy for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16579v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining temporal stability is crucial in multi-agent trajectory prediction. Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |

This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

Based on this representation, we extend the kinodynamic A* and the corridor-constrained trajectory optimization algorithms to efficiently tackle static and dynamic obstacles with arbitrary shapes. Collision avoidance between communicating robots is integrated by sharing planned trajectories and projecting them onto the SOGM.

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories.

However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory-based alignment, typically modeled as a classic hand-eye calibration, significantly influences the accuracy of evaluation metrics. However, traditional calibration methods are susceptible to the quality of the input poses. Few studies have taken this into account when evaluating VO/VIO trajectories that usually suffer from noise and drift. To fill this gap, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hand-eye calibration algorithm that fully leverages multiple constraints from screw theory for enhanced accuracy and robustness.

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Numerous methods exist that target different tasks involving trajectories such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. However, most methods target only one specific task and cannot be applied universally. Existing efforts to create a universal trajectory model often involve adding prediction modules for adapting to different tasks, while also struggle with incomplete or sparse trajectories. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM) designed to support different tasks based on incomplete or sparse trajectories without the need for retraining or extra prediction modules. To addresses task adaptability on incomplete trajectories, UVTM divide the spatio-temporal features of trajectories into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to suit the input and output needs of specific tasks. To handle sparse trajectories effectively, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing densely sampled trajectories from sparsely sampled ones, allowing it to extract detailed spatio-temporal information from sparse trajectories. Experiments involving three representative trajectory-related tasks on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the intended properties performance of UVTM and offer evidence that UVTM is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |

These data offer us vital insights to understand the movements of individuals and populations, benefiting a broad range of applications from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, improper release of trajectory data is increasing concerns on individual privacy. Previous attempts either lack strong privacy guarantees, or fail to preserve sufficient basic characteristics of the original data. In this paper, we propose DPTraj-PM, a method to synthesize trajectory dataset under the differential privacy (DP) framework while ensures high data utility. Based on the assumption that an individual's trajectory could be mainly determined by the initial trajectory segment (which depicts the starting point and the initial direction) and the next location point, DPTraj-PM discretizes the raw trajectories into neighboring cells, and models them by combining a prefix tree structure and an m-order Markov process. After adding noise to the model under differential privacy, DPTraj-PM generates a synthetic dataset from the noisy model to enable a wider spectrum of data mining and modeling tasks. The output traces crafted by DPTraj-PM not only preserves the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors, but also protects individual privacy. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DPTraj-PM substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of data utility.

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5.

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a $\textit{direct multiple shooting technique}$ -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

| **[On the Trajectories of SGD Without Replacement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16143v2)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article examines the implicit regularization effect of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Social Force Embedded Mixed Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-class Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13378v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of agent motion trajectories is crucial for autonomous driving, contributing to the reduction of collision risks in human-vehicle interactions and ensuring ample response time for other traffic participants. Current research predominantly focuses on traditional deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These methods leverage relative distances to forecast the motion trajectories of a single class of agents. However, in complex traffic scenarios, the motion patterns of various types of traffic participants exhibit inherent randomness and uncertainty. Relying solely on relative distances may not adequately capture the nuanced interaction patterns between different classes of road users. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class trajectory prediction method named the social force embedded mixed graph convolutional network (SFEM-GCN). SFEM-GCN comprises three graph topologies: the semantic graph (SG), position graph (PG), and velocity graph (VG). These graphs encode various of social force relationships among different classes of agents in complex scenes. Specifically, SG utilizes one-hot encoding of agent-class information to guide the construction of graph adjacency matrices based on semantic information. PG and VG create adjacency matrices to capture motion interaction relationships between different classes agents. These graph structures are then integrated into a mixed graph, where learning is conducted using a spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCNN). To further enhance prediction performance, we adopt temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to generate the predicted trajectory with fewer parameters. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that SFEM-GCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,3 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent vehicles</p></details> |

However, handling collisions and intersections in neural simulations remains a largely unsolved problem. In this work, we present \moniker{}, a learning-based solution for handling intersections in neural cloth simulations. Unlike conventional approaches that critically rely on intersection-free inputs, \moniker{} robustly recovers from intersections introduced through missed collisions, self-penetrating bodies, or errors in manually designed multi-layer outfits. The technical core of \moniker{} is a novel intersection contour loss that penalizes interpenetrations and encourages rapid resolution thereof. We integrate our intersection loss with a collision-avoiding repulsion objective into a neural cloth simulation method based on graph neural networks (GNNs). We demonstrate our method's ability across a challenging set of diverse multi-layer outfits under dynamic human motions. Our extensive analysis indicates that \moniker{} significantly improves collision handling for learned simulation and produces visually compelling results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by SIGGRAPH 2024, conference track</p></details> |

This paper presents Desk-AId that supports the desk assessment phase by estimating landmine risks using geospatial data and socioeconomic information. Desk-AId uses a Geospatial AI approach specialized to landmines. The approach includes mixed data sampling strategies and context-enrichment by historical conflicts and key multi-domain facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, health sites). The proposed system addresses the issue of having only ground-truth for confirmed hazardous areas by implementing a new hard-negative data sampling strategy, where negative points are sampled in the vicinity of hazardous areas. Experiments validate Desk-Aid in two domains for landmine risk assessment: 1) country-wide, and 2) uncharted study areas). The proposed approach increases the estimation accuracies up to 92%, for different classification models such as RandomForest (RF), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN).</p></details> |  |

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 33 pages, 12 figures |

Recent advances in binary function name prediction using data-driven machine learning show promise. However, existing approaches encounter difficulties in capturing function semantics in diverse optimized binaries and fail to reserve the meaning of labels in function names. We propose Epitome, a framework that enhances function name prediction using votes-based name tokenization and multi-task learning, specifically tailored for different compilation optimization binaries. Epitome learns comprehensive function semantics by pre-trained assembly language model and graph neural network, incorporating function semantics similarity prediction task, to maximize the similarity of function semantics in the context of different compilation optimization levels. In addition, we present two data preprocessing methods to improve the comprehensibility of function names. We evaluate the performance of Epitome using 2,597,346 functions extracted from binaries compiled with 5 optimizations (O0-Os) for 4 architectures (x64, x86, ARM, and MIPS). Epitome outperforms the state-of-the-art function name prediction tool by up to 44.34%, 64.16%, and 54.44% in precision, recall, and F1 score, while also exhibiting superior generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 figures, ACM ESEC/FSE 2024</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning in Earthquake Engineering: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09021v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article surveys the growing interest in utilizing Deep Learning (DL) as a powerful tool to address challenging problems in earthquake engineering. Despite decades of advancement in domain knowledge, issues such as uncertainty in earthquake occurrence, unpredictable seismic loads, nonlinear structural responses, and community engagement remain difficult to tackle using domain-specific methods. DL offers promising solutions by leveraging its data-driven capacity for nonlinear mapping, sequential data modeling, automatic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, optimal decision-making, etc. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive review that systematically covers a consistent scope intersecting DL and earthquake engineering. To bridge the gap, the article first discusses methodological advances to elucidate various applicable DL techniques, such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), generative adversarial network (GAN), autoencoder (AE), transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), and graph neural network (GNN). A thorough research landscape is then disclosed by exploring various DL applications across different research topics, including vision-based seismic damage assessment and structural characterization, seismic demand and damage state prediction, seismic response history prediction, regional seismic risk assessment and community resilience, ground motion (GM) for engineering use, seismic response control, and the inverse problem of system/damage identification. Suitable DL techniques for each research topic are identified, emphasizing the preeminence of CNN for vision-based tasks, RNN for sequential data, RL for community resilience, and unsupervised learning for GM analysis. The article also discusses opportunities and challenges for leveraging DL in earthquake engineering research and practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Distillation with Eigenbasis Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09202v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing amount of graph data places requirements on the efficient training of graph neural networks (GNNs). The emerging graph distillation (GD) tackles this challenge by distilling a small synthetic graph to replace the real large graph, ensuring GNNs trained on real and synthetic graphs exhibit comparable performance. However, existing methods rely on GNN-related information as supervision, including gradients, representations, and trajectories, which have two limitations. First, GNNs can affect the spectrum (i.e., eigenvalues) of the real graph, causing spectrum bias in the synthetic graph. Second, the variety of GNN architectures leads to the creation of different synthetic graphs, requiring traversal to obtain optimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose Graph Distillation with Eigenbasis Matching (GDEM), which aligns the eigenbasis and node features of real and synthetic graphs. Meanwhile, it directly replicates the spectrum of the real graph and thus prevents the influence of GNNs. Moreover, we design a discrimination constraint to balance the effectiveness and generalization of GDEM. Theoretically, the synthetic graphs distilled by GDEM are restricted spectral approximations of the real graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDEM outperforms state-of-the-art GD methods with powerful cross-architecture generalization ability and significant distillation efficiency.

We introduce ChargE3Net, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network for predicting electron density in atomic systems. ChargE3Net enables the learning of higher-order equivariant feature to achieve high predictive accuracy and model expressivity. We show that ChargE3Net exceeds the performance of prior work on diverse sets of molecules and materials. When trained on the massive dataset of over 100K materials in the Materials Project database, our model is able to capture the complexity and variability in the data, leading to a significant 26.7% reduction in self-consistent iterations when used to initialize DFT calculations on unseen materials. Furthermore, we show that non-self-consistent DFT calculations using our predicted charge densities yield near-DFT performance on electronic and thermodynamic property prediction at a fraction of the computational cost. Further analysis attributes the greater predictive accuracy to improved modeling of systems with high angular variations. These results illuminate a pathway towards a machine learning-accelerated ab initio calculations for materials discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeNet: A Graph Neural Network-based Anti-noise Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18296v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional approaches to semantic communication tasks rely on the knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to mitigate channel noise. Moreover, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

As a result, the need for network management automation is emphasized, and Digital Twin Networks (DTN) technology is expected to become the foundation technology for autonomous networks. DTN has the advantage of being able to operate and system networks based on real-time collected data in a closed-loop system, and currently it is mainly designed for optimization scenarios. To improve network performance in optimization scenarios, it is necessary to select appropriate configurations and perform accurate performance evaluation based on real data. However, most network evaluation models currently use simulation data. Meanwhile, according to DTN standards documents, artificial intelligence (AI) models can ensure scalability, real-time performance, and accuracy in large-scale networks. Various AI research and standardization work is ongoing to optimize the use of DTN. When designing AI models, it is crucial to consider the characteristics of the data. This paper presents an autoencoder-based skip connected message passing neural network (AE-SMPN) as a network evaluation model using real network data. The model is created by utilizing graph neural network (GNN) with recurrent neural network (RNN) models to capture the spatiotemporal features of network data. Additionally, an AutoEncoder (AE) is employed to extract initial features. The neural network was trained using the real DTN dataset provided by the Barcelona Neural Networking Center (BNN-UPC), and the paper presents the analysis of the model structure along with experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at IEEE ICC 2024 Workshop - DDINS</p></details> |

Accurate traffic prediction can offer network operators valuable insights into network conditions and suggest optimal allocation policies. Recently, spatio-temporal forecasting, employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as a promising method for cellular traffic prediction. However, existing studies, inspired by road traffic forecasting formulations, overlook the dynamic deployment and removal of base stations, requiring the GNN-based forecaster to handle an evolving graph. This work introduces a novel inductive learning scheme and a generalizable GNN-based forecasting model that can process diverse graphs of cellular traffic with one-time training. We also demonstrate that this model can be easily leveraged by transfer learning with minimal effort, making it applicable to different areas. Experimental results show up to 9.8% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art, especially in rare-data settings with training data reduced to below 20%.</p></details> |  |

| **[Equipping Federated Graph Neural Networks with Structure-aware Group Fairness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12350v3)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various types of graph data processing and analytical tasks in different domains. Training GNNs over centralized graph data can be infeasible due to privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions. Thus, federated learning (FL) becomes a trending solution to address this challenge in a distributed learning paradigm. However, as GNNs may inherit historical bias from training data and lead to discriminatory predictions, the bias of local models can be easily propagated to the global model in distributed settings. This poses a new challenge in mitigating bias in federated GNNs. To address this challenge, we propose $\text{F}^2$GNN, a Fair Federated Graph Neural Network, that enhances group fairness of federated GNNs. As bias can be sourced from both data and learning algorithms, $\text{F}^2$GNN aims to mitigate both types of bias under federated settings. First, we provide theoretical insights on the connection between data bias in a training graph and statistical fairness metrics of the trained GNN models. Based on the theoretical analysis, we design $\text{F}^2$GNN which contains two key components: a fairness-aware local model update scheme that enhances group fairness of the local models on the client side, and a fairness-weighted global model update scheme that takes both data bias and fairness metrics of local models into consideration in the aggregation process. We evaluate $\text{F}^2$GNN empirically versus a number of baseline methods, and demonstrate that $\text{F}^2$GNN outperforms these baselines in terms of both fairness and model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Parameterized Quantum Circuits Expressibility Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08100v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are fundamental to quantum machine learning (QML), quantum optimization, and variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). The expressibility of PQCs is a measure that determines their capability to harness the full potential of the quantum state space. It is thus a crucial guidepost to know when selecting a particular PQC ansatz. However, the existing technique for expressibility computation through statistical estimation requires a large number of samples, which poses significant challenges due to time and computational resource constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach for expressibility estimation of PQCs using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We demonstrate the predictive power of our GNN model with a dataset consisting of 25,000 samples from the noiseless IBM QASM Simulator and 12,000 samples from three distinct noisy quantum backends. The model accurately estimates expressibility, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.05 and 0.06 for the noiseless and noisy backends, respectively. We compare our model's predictions with reference circuits [Sim and others, QuTe'2019] and IBM Qiskit's hardware-efficient ansatz sets to further evaluate our model's performance. Our experimental evaluation in noiseless and noisy scenarios reveals a close alignment with ground truth expressibility values, highlighting the model's efficacy. Moreover, our model exhibits promising extrapolation capabilities, predicting expressibility values with low RMSE for out-of-range qubit circuits trained solely on only up to 5-qubit circuit sets. This work thus provides a reliable means of efficiently evaluating the expressibility of diverse PQCs on noiseless simulators and hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[KG-Planner: Knowledge-Informed Graph Neural Planning for Collaborative Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07962v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel knowledge-informed graph neural planner (KG-Planner) to address the challenge of efficiently planning collision-free motions for robots in high-dimensional spaces, considering both static and dynamic environments involving humans. Unlike traditional motion planners that struggle with finding a balance between efficiency and optimality, the KG-Planner takes a different approach. Instead of relying solely on a neural network or imitating the motions of an oracle planner, our KG-Planner integrates explicit physical knowledge from the workspace. The integration of knowledge has two key aspects: (1) we present an approach to design a graph that can comprehensively model the workspace's compositional structure. The designed graph explicitly incorporates critical elements such as robot joints, obstacles, and their interconnections. This representation allows us to capture the intricate relationships between these elements. (2) We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that excels at generating nearly optimal robot motions. In particular, the GNN employs a layer-wise propagation rule to facilitate the exchange and update of information among workspace elements based on their connections. This propagation emphasizes the influence of these elements throughout the planning process. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of our KG-Planner, we conduct extensive experiments in both static and dynamic environments. These experiments include scenarios with and without human workers. The results of our approach are compared against existing methods, showcasing the superior performance of the KG-Planner. A short video introduction of this work is available (video link provided in the paper).</p></details> |  |
| **[All Nodes are created Not Equal: Node-Specific Layer Aggregation and Filtration for GNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07892v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-designed Graph Neural Networks, though opening a promising path for the modeling of the graph-structure data, unfortunately introduce two daunting obstacles to their deployment on devices. (I) Most of existing GNNs are shallow, due mostly to the over-smoothing and gradient-vanish problem as they go deeper as convolutional architectures. (II) The vast majority of GNNs adhere to the homophily assumption, where the central node and its adjacent nodes share the same label. This assumption often poses challenges for many GNNs working with heterophilic graphs. Addressing the aforementioned issue has become a looming challenge in enhancing the robustness and scalability of GNN applications. In this paper, we take a comprehensive and systematic approach to overcoming the two aforementioned challenges for the first time. We propose a Node-Specific Layer Aggregation and Filtration architecture, termed NoSAF, a framework capable of filtering and processing information from each individual nodes. NoSAF introduces the concept of "All Nodes are Created Not Equal" into every layer of deep networks, aiming to provide a reliable information filter for each layer's nodes to sieve out information beneficial for the subsequent layer. By incorporating a dynamically updated codebank, NoSAF dynamically optimizes the optimal information outputted downwards at each layer. This effectively overcomes heterophilic issues and aids in deepening the network. To compensate for the information loss caused by the continuous filtering in NoSAF, we also propose NoSAF-D (Deep), which incorporates a compensation mechanism that replenishes information in every layer of the model, allowing NoSAF to perform meaningful computations even in very deep layers.</p></details> |  |

On the one hand, Variational Quantum Algorithms such as QAOA can be used to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems. On the other hand, the same class of problems can be solved by NCO, a method that has shown promising results, particularly since the introduction of Graph Neural Networks. Given recent advances in both research areas, we introduce Hamiltonian-based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), an approach at the intersection of QC and NCO. We model our ansatzes directly on the combinatorial optimization problem's Hamiltonian formulation, which allows us to apply our approach to a broad class of problems. Our ansatzes show favourable trainability properties when compared to the hardware efficient ansatzes, while also not being limited to graph-based problems, unlike previous works. In this work, we evaluate the performance of Hamiltonian-based QRL on a diverse set of combinatorial optimization problems to demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach and compare it to QAOA.</p></details> |  |

The GNNs are trained using supervised learning, to predict the power grid's aggregated bus-level (either zonal or system-level) or individual branch-level state under different power supply and demand conditions. The variability of the stochastic grid variables (wind/solar generation and load demand), and their statistical correlations, are rigorously considered while generating the inputs for the training data. The outputs in the training data, obtained by solving numerous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimal power flow problems, correspond to system-level, zonal and transmission line-level quantities of interest (QoIs). The QoIs predicted by the GNNs are used to conduct hours-ahead, sampling-based reliability and risk assessment w.r.t. zonal and system-level (load shedding) as well as branch-level (overloading) failure events. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for three synthetic grids with sizes ranging from 118 to 2848 buses. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and can be good proxies for computationally expensive MILP algorithms. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment suggests that GNN models can substantially improve situational awareness by quickly providing rigorous reliability and risk estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Applied Energy</p></details> |

Global models that model past data from multiple related time series globally while producing series-specific forecasts locally are now common. However, their forecasts for each individual series remain isolated, failing to account for the current state of its neighbouring series. Multivariate models like multivariate attention and graph neural networks can explicitly incorporate inter-series information, thus addressing the shortcomings of global models. However, these techniques exhibit quadratic complexity per timestep, limiting scalability. This paper introduces the Context Neural Network, an efficient linear complexity approach for augmenting time series models with relevant contextual insights from neighbouring time series without significant computational overhead. The proposed method enriches predictive models by providing the target series with real-time information from its neighbours, addressing the limitations of global models, yet remaining computationally tractable for large datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Graph Representation Learning via Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07011v1)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group fairness for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which emphasizes algorithmic decisions neither favoring nor harming certain groups defined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race and gender), has gained considerable attention. In particular, the objective of group fairness is to ensure that the decisions made by GNNs are independent of the sensitive attribute. To achieve this objective, most existing approaches involve eliminating sensitive attribute information in node representations or algorithmic decisions. However, such ways may also eliminate task-related information due to its inherent correlation with the sensitive attribute, leading to a sacrifice in utility. In this work, we focus on improving the fairness of GNNs while preserving task-related information and propose a fair GNN framework named FairSAD. Instead of eliminating sensitive attribute information, FairSAD enhances the fairness of GNNs via Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement (SAD), which separates the sensitive attribute-related information into an independent component to mitigate its impact. Additionally, FairSAD utilizes a channel masking mechanism to adaptively identify the sensitive attribute-related component and subsequently decorrelates it. Overall, FairSAD minimizes the impact of the sensitive attribute on GNN outcomes rather than eliminating sensitive attributes, thereby preserving task-related information associated with the sensitive attribute. Furthermore, experiments conducted on several real-world datasets demonstrate that FairSAD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in terms of both fairness and utility performance.

In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, for link prediction tasks on discrete dynamic graphs, the requirement of substantial GPU memory to store embeddings of all nodes hinders the scalability of existing models. In this paper, we introduce an Input {\bf S}napshots {\bf F}usion based {\bf Dy}namic {\bf G}raph Neural Network (SFDyG). By eliminating the partitioning of snapshots within the input window, we obtain a multi-graph (more than one edge between two nodes). Subsequently, by introducing a graph denoising problem with the assumption of temporal decayed smoothing, we integrate Hawkes process theory into Graph Neural Networks to model the generated multi-graph. Furthermore, based on the multi-graph, we propose a scalable three-step mini-batch training method and demonstrate its equivalence to full-batch training counterpart. Our experiments, conducted on eight distinct dynamic graph datasets for future link prediction tasks, revealed that SFDyG generally surpasses related methods.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks demonstrate proficiency in modeling this type of data, their success is often reliant on significant amounts of labeled data, posing a challenge in practical scenarios with limited annotation resources. To tackle this problem, tremendous efforts have been devoted to enhancing graph machine learning performance under low-resource settings by exploring various approaches to minimal supervision. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of Data-Efficient Graph Learning (DEGL) as a research frontier, and present the first survey that summarizes the current progress of DEGL. We initiate by highlighting the challenges inherent in training models with large labeled data, paving the way for our exploration into DEGL.

However, owing to complex data representations, GNNs do not easily allow for human-intelligible explanations of their predictions, which can decrease trust in them as well as deter any collaboration opportunities between the AI expert and non-technical, domain expert. Here, we first discuss the two papers that aim to provide GNN explanations to domain experts in an accessible manner and then establish a set of design requirements for human-centered GNN explanations. Finally, we offer two example prototypes to demonstrate some of those proposed requirements.</p></details> |  |

A major bottleneck in ViGs is the inefficient k-nearest neighbor (KNN) operation used for graph construction. To solve this issue, we propose a new method for designing ViGs, Dynamic Axial Graph Construction (DAGC), which is more efficient than KNN as it limits the number of considered graph connections made within an image. Additionally, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, GreedyViG, which uses DAGC. Extensive experiments show that GreedyViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, GreedyViG-S, achieves 81.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 2.9% higher than Vision GNN and 2.2% higher than Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (ViHGNN), with less GMACs and a similar number of parameters. Our largest model, GreedyViG-B obtains 83.9% top-1 accuracy, 0.2% higher than Vision GNN, with a 66.6% decrease in parameters and a 69% decrease in GMACs. GreedyViG-B also obtains the same accuracy as ViHGNN with a 67.3% decrease in parameters and a 71.3% decrease in GMACs. Our work shows that hybrid CNN-GNN architectures not only provide a new avenue for designing efficient models, but that they can also exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</p></details> |

Suppose there is a mixed set containing scattered parts from various shapes. This task requires algorithms to find out every possible combination among all the parts. To address this challenge, we propose the so called Gradient Field-based Auto-Regressive Sampling framework (G-FARS) tailored specifically for the 3D part grouping task. In our framework, we design a gradient-field-based selection graph neural network (GNN) to learn the gradients of a log conditional probability density in terms of part selection, where the condition is the given mixed part set. This innovative approach, implemented through the gradient-field-based selection GNN, effectively captures complex relationships among all the parts in the input. Upon completion of the training process, our framework becomes capable of autonomously grouping 3D parts by iteratively selecting them from the mixed part set, leveraging the knowledge acquired by the trained gradient-field-based selection GNN. Our code is available at: https://github.com/J-F-Cheng/G-FARS-3DPartGrouping.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

However, despite the growing volume of literature in this field, there remains a notable absence of a unified dataset and a fair benchmark to evaluate and compare existing approaches. To address this crucial gap, we present G4SATBench, the first benchmark study that establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for GNN-based SAT solvers. In G4SATBench, we meticulously curate a large and diverse set of SAT datasets comprising 7 problems with 3 difficulty levels and benchmark a broad range of GNN models across various prediction tasks, training objectives, and inference algorithms. To explore the learning abilities and comprehend the strengths and limitations of GNN-based SAT solvers, we also compare their solving processes with the heuristics in search-based SAT solvers. Our empirical results provide valuable insights into the performance of GNN-based SAT solvers and further suggest that existing GNN models can effectively learn a solving strategy akin to greedy local search but struggle to learn backtracking search in the latent space.

Graph theory provides a unifying framework to model such datasets and enables the use of powerful tools that can help analyze, visualize, and extract value from data. In this work, we present PlasmoData.jl, an open-source, Julia framework that uses concepts of graph theory to facilitate the modeling and analysis of complex datasets. The core of our framework is a general data modeling abstraction, which we call a DataGraph. We show how the abstraction and software implementation can be used to represent diverse data objects as graphs and to enable the use of tools from topology, graph theory, and machine learning (e.g., graph neural networks) to conduct a variety of tasks. We illustrate the versatility of the framework by using real datasets: i) an image classification problem using topological data analysis to extract features from the graph model to train machine learning models; ii) a disease outbreak problem where we model multivariate time series as graphs to detect abnormal events; and iii) a technology pathway analysis problem where we highlight how we can use graphs to navigate connectivity. Our discussion also highlights how PlasmoData.jl leverages native Julia capabilities to enable compact syntax, scalable computations, and interfaces with diverse packages.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 18 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Recently, state-of-the-art two-stage 3D object detectors have exhibited promising performance. However, these methods refine proposals individually, ignoring the rich contextual information in the object relationships between the neighbor proposals. In this study, we introduce an object relation module, consisting of a graph generator and a graph neural network (GNN), to learn the spatial information from certain patterns to improve 3D object detection. Specifically, we create an inter-object relationship graph based on proposals in a frame via the graph generator to connect each proposal with its neighbor proposals. Afterward, the GNN module extracts edge features from the generated graph and iteratively refines proposal features with the captured edge features. Ultimately, we leverage the refined features as input to the detection head to obtain detection results. Our approach improves upon the baseline PV-RCNN on the KITTI validation set for the car class across easy, moderate, and hard difficulty levels by 0.82%, 0.74%, and 0.58%, respectively. Additionally, our method outperforms the baseline by more than 1% under the moderate and hard levels BEV AP on the test server.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has established that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) deliver impressive outcomes in graph-centric tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite these advancements, challenges like data sparsity and limited generalization capabilities continue to persist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention in natural language processing. They excel in language comprehension and summarization. Integrating LLMs with graph learning techniques has attracted interest as a way to enhance performance in graph learning tasks. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth review of the latest state-of-the-art LLMs applied in graph learning and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize existing methods based on their framework design. We detail four unique designs: i) GNNs as Prefix, ii) LLMs as Prefix, iii) LLMs-Graphs Integration, and iv) LLMs-Only, highlighting key methodologies within each category. We explore the strengths and limitations of each framework, and emphasize potential avenues for future research, including overcoming current integration challenges between LLMs and graph learning techniques, and venturing into new application areas. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners eager to leverage large language models in graph learning, and to inspire continued progress in this dynamic field.

Curriculum learning is a machine learning strategy where training examples are presented to a model in a structured order, starting with easy examples and gradually increasing difficulty, aiming to improve learning efficiency and generalization. To better exploit the rich information in HINs, previous methods have started to explore the use of curriculum learning strategy to train HGNNs. Specifically, these works utilize the absolute value of the loss at each training epoch to evaluate the learning difficulty of each training sample. However, the relative loss, rather than the absolute value of loss, reveals the learning difficulty. Therefore, we propose a novel loss-decrease-aware training schedule (LDTS). LDTS uses the trend of loss decrease between each training epoch to better evaluating the difficulty of training samples, thereby enhancing the curriculum learning of HGNNs for downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose a sampling strategy to alleviate training imbalance issues. Our method further demonstrate the efficacy of curriculum learning in enhancing HGNNs capabilities. We call our method Loss-decrease-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (LDHGNN).

In this paper, we present the first PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for KGRL methods. To analyze a broad class of KGRL models, we propose a generic framework named ReED (Relation-aware Encoder-Decoder), which consists of a relation-aware message passing encoder and a triplet classification decoder. Our ReED framework can express at least 15 different existing KGRL models, including not only graph neural network-based models such as R-GCN and CompGCN but also shallow-architecture models such as RotatE and ANALOGY. Our generalization bounds for the ReED framework provide theoretical grounds for the commonly used tricks in KGRL, e.g., parameter-sharing and weight normalization schemes, and guide desirable design choices for practical KGRL methods. We empirically show that the critical factors in our generalization bounds can explain actual generalization errors on three real-world knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024.

Distributing the training process across multiple computing nodes is the most promising solution to address the challenges of ever-growing real-world graphs. However, current adversarial attack methods on GNNs neglect the characteristics and applications of the distributed scenario, leading to suboptimal performance and inefficiency in attacking distributed GNN training. In this study, we introduce Disttack, the first framework of adversarial attacks for distributed GNN training that leverages the characteristics of frequent gradient updates in a distributed system. Specifically, Disttack corrupts distributed GNN training by injecting adversarial attacks into one single computing node. The attacked subgraphs are precisely perturbed to induce an abnormal gradient ascent in backpropagation, disrupting gradient synchronization between computing nodes and thus leading to a significant performance decline of the trained GNN. We evaluate Disttack on four large real-world graphs by attacking five widely adopted GNNs. Compared with the state-of-the-art attack method, experimental results demonstrate that Disttack amplifies the model accuracy degradation by 2.75$\times$ and achieves speedup by 17.33$\times$ on average while maintaining unnoticeability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 30th International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing(Euro-Par 2024)</p></details> |

Unsupervised segmentation, particularly in the absence of labeled data, remains a challenging task due to the inter-class similarity and variations in intensity and resolution.

In particular, de Santi et al. (2023) developed models that could accurately infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from catalogs that only contain the positions and radial velocities of galaxies that are robust to uncertainties in astrophysics and subgrid models. However, observations are affected by many effects, including 1) masking, 2) uncertainties in peculiar velocities and radial distances, and 3) different galaxy selections. Moreover, observations only allow us to measure redshift, intertwining galaxies' radial positions and velocities. In this paper we train and test our models on galaxy catalogs, created from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with different codes from the CAMELS project, that incorporate these observational effects. We find that, although the presence of these effects degrades the precision and accuracy of the models, and increases the fraction of catalogs where the model breaks down, the fraction of galaxy catalogs where the model performs well is over 90 %, demonstrating the potential of these models to constrain cosmological parameters even when applied to real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 25 figures.

However, information exchanges among neighbor nodes in GNN pose new challenges in the resource-constrained scenario, especially in wireless systems. In practical wireless systems, the communication links among nodes are usually unreliable due to wireless fading and receiver noise, consequently resulting in performance degradation of GNNs. To improve the learning performance of GNNs, we aim to maximize the number of long-term average (LTA) communication links by the optimized power control under energy consumption constraints. Using the Lyapunov optimization method, we first transform the intractable long-term problem into a deterministic problem in each time slot by converting the long-term energy constraints into the objective function. In spite of this non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we address this problem via equivalently solving a sequence of convex feasibility problems together with a greedy based solver. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages,3 figures |

Typically, GNNs can be implemented in two settings, including the transductive setting and the inductive setting. In the transductive setting, the trained model can only predict the labels of nodes that were observed at the training time. In the inductive setting, the trained model can be generalized to new nodes/graphs. Due to its flexibility, the inductive setting is the most popular GNN setting at the moment. Previous work has shown that transductive GNNs are vulnerable to a series of privacy attacks. However, a comprehensive privacy analysis of inductive GNN models is still missing. This paper fills the gap by conducting a systematic privacy analysis of inductive GNNs through the lens of link stealing attacks, one of the most popular attacks that are specifically designed for GNNs. We propose two types of link stealing attacks, i.e., posterior-only attacks and combined attacks. We define threat models of the posterior-only attacks with respect to node topology and the combined attacks by considering combinations of posteriors, node attributes, and graph features. Extensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that inductive GNNs leak rich information that enables link stealing attacks with advantageous properties. Even attacks with no knowledge about graph structures can be effective. We also show that our attacks are robust to different node similarities and different graph features. As a counterpart, we investigate two possible defenses and discover they are ineffective against our attacks, which calls for more effective defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 24th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2024), July 15-20, 2024</p></details> |
| **[G-SAP: Graph-based Structure-Aware Prompt Learning over Heterogeneous Knowledge for Commonsense Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05616v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commonsense question answering has demonstrated considerable potential across various applications like assistants and social robots. Although fully fine-tuned pre-trained Language Models(LM) have achieved remarkable performance in commonsense reasoning, their tendency to excessively prioritize textual information hampers the precise transfer of structural knowledge and undermines interpretability. Some studies have explored combining LMs with Knowledge Graphs(KGs) by coarsely fusing the two modalities to perform Graph Neural Network(GNN)-based reasoning that lacks a profound interaction between heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-based Structure-Aware Prompt Learning Model for commonsense reasoning, named G-SAP, aiming to maintain a balance between heterogeneous knowledge and enhance the cross-modal interaction within the LM+GNNs model. In particular, an evidence graph is constructed by integrating multiple knowledge sources, i.e. ConceptNet, Wikipedia, and Cambridge Dictionary to boost the performance. Afterward, a structure-aware frozen PLM is employed to fully incorporate the structured and textual information from the evidence graph, where the generation of prompts is driven by graph entities and relations. Finally, a heterogeneous message-passing reasoning module is used to facilitate deep interaction of knowledge between the LM and graph-based networks. Empirical validation, conducted through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrates the notable performance of the proposed model. The results reveal a significant advancement over the existing models, especially, with 6.12% improvement over the SoTA LM+GNNs model on the OpenbookQA dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDIPrompt: Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction based on Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly prevalent in predicting adverse drug-drug interactions (DDI) due to their proficiency in modeling the intricate associations between atoms and functional groups within and across drug molecules. However, they are still hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the issue of highly imbalanced event distribution, which is a common but critical problem in medical datasets where certain interactions are vastly underrepresented. This imbalance poses a substantial barrier to achieving accurate and reliable DDI predictions. (2) the scarcity of labeled data for rare events, which is a pervasive issue in the medical field where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-studied due to limited available data. In response, we offer DDIPrompt, an innovative panacea inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompting. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt employs augmented links between drugs, considering both structural and interactive proximity. It features a hierarchical pre-training strategy that comprehends intra-molecular structures and inter-molecular interactions, fostering a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of drug properties. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DDIPrompt, particularly in predicting rare DDI events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks for Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07678v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often assume strong homophily for graph classification, seldom considering heterophily, which means connected nodes tend to have different class labels and dissimilar features. In real-world scenarios, graphs may have nodes that exhibit both homophily and heterophily. Failing to generalize to this setting makes many GNNs underperform in graph classification. In this paper, we address this limitation by identifying three effective designs and develop a novel GNN architecture called IHGNN (short for Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks). These designs include the combination of integration and separation of the ego- and neighbor-embeddings of nodes, adaptive aggregation of node embeddings from different layers, and differentiation between different node embeddings for constructing the graph-level readout function. We empirically validate IHGNN on various graph datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art GNNs for graph classification.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Recently, GNNs incorporating contrastive learning have demonstrated promising performance in handling the sparse data problem of recommendation systems. However, existing contrastive learning methods still have limitations in resisting noise interference, especially for multi-behavior recommendation. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a GNN-based multi-behavior recommendation model called MB-SVD that utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) graphs to enhance model performance. In particular, MB-SVD considers user preferences across different behaviors, improving recommendation effectiveness. First, MB-SVD integrates the representation of users and items under different behaviors with learnable weight scores, which efficiently considers the influence of different behaviors. Then, MB-SVD generates augmented graph representation with global collaborative relations. Next, we simplify the contrastive learning framework by directly contrasting original representation with the enhanced representation using the InfoNCE loss. Through extensive experimentation, the remarkable performance of our proposed MB-SVD approach in multi-behavior recommendation endeavors across diverse real-world datasets is exhibited.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Inference in Molecular Diffusion Models with Latent Representations of Protein Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13466v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for addressing problems in structural biology and structure-based drug design. These models operate directly on 3D molecular structures. Due to the unfavorable scaling of graph neural networks (GNNs) with graph size as well as the relatively slow inference speeds inherent to diffusion models, many existing molecular diffusion models rely on coarse-grained representations of protein structure to make training and inference feasible. However, such coarse-grained representations discard essential information for modeling molecular interactions and impair the quality of generated structures. In this work, we present a novel GNN-based architecture for learning latent representations of molecular structure. When trained end-to-end with a diffusion model for de novo ligand design, our model achieves comparable performance to one with an all-atom protein representation while exhibiting a 3-fold reduction in inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper appeared as a spotlight paper at the NeurIPS 2023 Generative AI and Biology Workshop</p></details> |

Mainstream modern SAT solvers are based on the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm. Recent work aimed to enhance CDCL SAT solvers using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, so far this approach either has not made solving more effective, or required substantial GPU resources for frequent online model inferences. Aiming to make GNN improvements practical, this paper proposes an approach called NeuroBack, which builds on two insights: (1) predicting phases (i.e., values) of variables appearing in the majority (or even all) of the satisfying assignments are essential for CDCL SAT solving, and (2) it is sufficient to query the neural model only once for the predictions before the SAT solving starts. Once trained, the offline model inference allows NeuroBack to execute exclusively on the CPU, removing its reliance on GPU resources. To train NeuroBack, a new dataset called DataBack containing 120,286 data samples is created. NeuroBack is implemented as an enhancement to a state-of-the-art SAT solver called Kissat. As a result, it allowed Kissat to solve up to 5.2% and 7.4% more problems on two recent SAT competition problem sets, SATCOMP-2022 and SATCOMP-2023, respectively. NeuroBack therefore shows how machine learning can be harnessed to improve SAT solving in an effective and practical manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper has been accepted by ICLR'24</p></details> |

To train GNNs on large graphs that exceed CPU memory, several systems store data on disk and conduct out-of-core processing. However, these systems suffer from either read amplification when reading node features that are usually smaller than a disk page or degraded model accuracy by treating the graph as disconnected partitions. To close this gap, we build a system called DiskGNN, which achieves high I/O efficiency and thus fast training without hurting model accuracy. The key technique used by DiskGNN is offline sampling, which helps decouple graph sampling from model computation. In particular, by conducting graph sampling beforehand, DiskGNN acquires the node features that will be accessed by model computation, and such information is utilized to pack the target node features contiguously on disk to avoid read amplification. Besides, \name{} also adopts designs including four-level feature store to fully utilize the memory hierarchy to cache node features and reduce disk access, batched packing to accelerate the feature packing process, and pipelined training to overlap disk access with other operations. We compare DiskGNN with Ginex and MariusGNN, which are state-of-the-art systems for out-of-core GNN training. The results show that DiskGNN can speed up the baselines by over 8x while matching their best model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Quantum Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05205v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To accelerate the process of materials design, materials science has increasingly used data driven techniques to extract information from collected data. Specially, machine learning (ML) algorithms, which span the ML discipline, have demonstrated ability to predict various properties of materials with the level of accuracy similar to explicit calculation of quantum mechanical theories, but with significantly reduced run time and computational resources. Within ML, graph neural networks have emerged as an important algorithm within the field of machine learning, since they are capable of predicting accurately a wide range of important physical, chemical and electronic properties due to their higher learning ability based on the graph representation of material and molecular descriptors through the aggregation of information embedded within the graph. In parallel with the development of state of the art classical machine learning applications, the fusion of quantum computing and machine learning have created a new paradigm where classical machine learning model can be augmented with quantum layers which are able to encode high dimensional data more efficiently. Leveraging the structure of existing algorithms, we developed a unique and novel gradient free hybrid quantum classical convoluted graph neural network (HyQCGNN) to predict formation energies of perovskite materials. The performance of our hybrid statistical model is competitive with the results obtained purely from a classical convoluted graph neural network, and other classical machine learning algorithms, such as XGBoost. Consequently, our study suggests a new pathway to explore how quantum feature encoding and parametric quantum circuits can yield drastic improvements of complex ML algorithm like graph neural network.</p></details> |  |

Existing works commonly adopt gradient-based strategy to update a large amount of parameters for task-level adaptation. However, the increase of adaptive parameters can lead to overfitting and poor performance. Observing that graph neural network (GNN) performs well as both encoder and predictor, we propose PACIA, a parameter-efficient GNN adapter for few-shot MPP. We design a unified adapter to generate a few adaptive parameters to modulate the message passing process of GNN. We then adopt a hierarchical adaptation mechanism to adapt the encoder at task-level and the predictor at query-level by the unified GNN adapter. Extensive results show that PACIA obtains the state-of-the-art performance in few-shot MPP problems, and our proposed hierarchical adaptation mechanism is rational and effective.</p></details> | 18pages |

To tackle this, GNN-based CTR models usually sample hundreds of neighbors out of the billions to facilitate efficient online recommendations. However, sampling only a small portion of neighbors results in a severe sampling bias and the failure to encompass the full spectrum of user or item behavioral patterns. To address this challenge, we name the conventional user-item recommendation graph as "micro recommendation graph" and introduce a more suitable MAcro Recommendation Graph (MAG) for billion-scale recommendations. MAG resolves the computational complexity problems in the infrastructure by reducing the node count from billions to hundreds. Specifically, MAG groups micro nodes (users and items) with similar behavior patterns to form macro nodes. Subsequently, we introduce tailored Macro Graph Neural Networks (MacGNN) to aggregate information on a macro level and revise the embeddings of macro nodes. MacGNN has already served Taobao's homepage feed for two months, providing recommendations for over one billion users. Extensive offline experiments on three public benchmark datasets and an industrial dataset present that MacGNN significantly outperforms twelve CTR baselines while remaining computationally efficient. Besides, online A/B tests confirm MacGNN's superiority in billion-scale recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, accepted by The Web Conference 2024</p></details> |

In this work we present a GNN which uses Graph Convolutional architectures to achieve very accurate multi-target screening. We also devised a hierarchical Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique to catch information directly at atom, ring, and whole molecule level by leveraging the message passing mechanism. In this way, we find the most relevant moieties involved in bioactivity prediction. Results: We report a state-of-the-art GNN classifier on twenty Cyclin-dependent Kinase targets in support of VS. Our classifier outperforms previous SOTA approaches proposed by the authors. Moreover, a CDK1-only high-sensitivity version of the GNN has been designed to use our explainer in order to avoid the inherent bias of multi-class models. The hierarchical explainer has been validated by an expert chemist on 19 approved drugs on CDK1. Our explainer provided information in accordance to the docking analysis for 17 out of the 19 test drugs. Conclusion: Our approach is a valid support for shortening both the screening and the hit-to-lead phase. Detailed knowledge about the molecular substructures that play a role in the inhibitory action, can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the pharmacophoric function of the molecule also for repurposing purposes.

| **[Dual-domain Collaborative Denoising for Social Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04942v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation leverages social network to complement user-item interaction data for recommendation task, aiming to mitigate the data sparsity issue in recommender systems. However, existing social recommendation methods encounter the following challenge: both social network and interaction data contain substaintial noise, and the propagation of such noise through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) not only fails to enhance recommendation performance but may also interfere with the model's normal training. Despite the importance of denoising for social network and interaction data, only a limited number of studies have considered the denoising for social network and all of them overlook that for interaction data, hindering the denoising effect and recommendation performance. Based on this, we propose a novel model called Dual-domain Collaborative Denoising for Social Recommendation ($\textbf{DCDSR}$). DCDSR comprises two primary modules: the structure-level collaborative denoising module and the embedding-space collaborative denoising module. In the structure-level collaborative denoising module, information from interaction domain is first employed to guide social network denoising. Subsequently, the denoised social network is used to supervise the denoising for interaction data. The embedding-space collaborative denoising module devotes to resisting the noise cross-domain diffusion problem through contrastive learning with dual-domain embedding collaborative perturbation. Additionally, a novel contrastive learning strategy, named Anchor-InfoNCE, is introduced to better harness the denoising capability of contrastive learning. Evaluating our model on three real-world datasets verifies that DCDSR has a considerable denoising effect, thus outperforms the state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Empowering Wireless Networks with Artificial Intelligence Generated Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04907v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In wireless communications, transforming network into graphs and processing them using deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), is one of the mainstream network optimization approaches. While effective, the generative AI (GAI) shows stronger capabilities in graph analysis, processing, and generation, than conventional methods such as GNN, offering a broader exploration space for graph-based network optimization. Therefore, this article proposes to use GAI-based graph generation to support wireless networks. Specifically, we first explore applications of graphs in wireless networks. Then, we introduce and analyze common GAI models from the perspective of graph generation. On this basis, we propose a framework that incorporates the conditional diffusion model and an evaluation network, which can be trained with reward functions and conditions customized by network designers and users. Once trained, the proposed framework can create graphs based on new conditions, helping to tackle problems specified by the user in wireless networks. Finally, using the link selection in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imbalanced Graph Classification with Multi-scale Oversampling Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04903v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in imbalanced graph classification is to learn expressive representations of the graphs in under-represented (minority) classes. Existing generic imbalanced learning methods, such as oversampling and imbalanced learning loss functions, can be adopted for enabling graph representation learning models to cope with this challenge. However, these methods often directly operate on the graph representations, ignoring rich discriminative information within the graphs and their interactions. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel multi-scale oversampling graph neural network (MOSGNN) that learns expressive minority graph representations based on intra- and inter-graph semantics resulting from oversampled graphs at multiple scales - subgraph, graph, and pairwise graphs. It achieves this by jointly optimizing subgraph-level, graph-level, and pairwise-graph learning tasks to learn the discriminative information embedded within and between the minority graphs. Extensive experiments on 16 imbalanced graph datasets show that MOSGNN i) significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art models, and ii) offers a generic framework, in which different advanced imbalanced learning loss functions can be easily plugged in and obtain significantly improved classification performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a new multi-teacher distillation method based on bi-level optimization (namely BO-NNC), to conduct noisy node classification on the graph data. Specifically, we first employ multiple self-supervised learning methods to train diverse teacher models, and then aggregate their predictions through a teacher weight matrix. Furthermore, we design a new bi-level optimization strategy to dynamically adjust the teacher weight matrix based on the training progress of the student model. Finally, we design a label improvement module to improve the label quality. Extensive experimental results on real datasets show that our method achieves the best results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Technique for Query Plan Representation Based on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04814v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning representations for query plans play a pivotal role in machine learning-based query optimizers of database management systems. To this end, particular model architectures are proposed in the literature to convert the tree-structured query plans into representations with formats learnable by downstream machine learning models. However, existing research rarely compares and analyzes the query plan representation capabilities of these tree models and their direct impact on the performance of the overall optimizer. To address this problem, we perform a comparative study to explore the effect of using different state-of-the-art tree models on the optimizer's cost estimation and plan selection performance in relatively complex workloads. Additionally, we explore the possibility of using graph neural networks (GNN) in the query plan representation task. We propose a novel tree model combining directed GNN with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and demonstrate experimentally that the new tree model provides significant improvements to cost estimation tasks and relatively excellent plan selection performance compared to the state-of-the-art tree models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the power of graph neural networks and the role of the activation function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04661v6)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article we present new results about the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We prove that for any GNN with piecewise polynomial activations, whose architecture size does not grow with the graph input sizes, there exists a pair of non-isomorphic rooted trees of depth two such that the GNN cannot distinguish their root vertex up to an arbitrary number of iterations. In contrast, it was already known that unbounded GNNs (those whose size is allowed to change with the graph sizes) with piecewise polynomial activations can distinguish these vertices in only two iterations. It was also known prior to our work that with ReLU (piecewise linear) activations, bounded GNNs are weaker than unbounded GNNs [ACI+22]. Our approach adds to this result by extending it to handle any piecewise polynomial activation function, which goes towards answering an open question formulated by [2021, Grohe] more completely. Our second result states that if one allows activations that are not piecewise polynomial, then in two iterations a single neuron perceptron can distinguish the root vertices of any pair of nonisomorphic trees of depth two (our results hold for activations like the sigmoid, hyperbolic tan and others). This shows how the power of graph neural networks can change drastically if one changes the activation function of the neural networks. The proof of this result utilizes the Lindemann-Weierstrauss theorem from transcendental number theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph-enhanced Dual Semi-supervised Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04773v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study semi-supervised graph classification, which aims at accurately predicting the categories of graphs in scenarios with limited labeled graphs and abundant unlabeled graphs. Despite the promising capability of graph neural networks (GNNs), they typically require a large number of costly labeled graphs, while a wealth of unlabeled graphs fail to be effectively utilized. Moreover, GNNs are inherently limited to encoding local neighborhood information using message-passing mechanisms, thus lacking the ability to model higher-order dependencies among nodes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-Enhanced DuAL framework named HEAL for semi-supervised graph classification, which captures graph semantics from the perspective of the hypergraph and the line graph, respectively. Specifically, to better explore the higher-order relationships among nodes, we design a hypergraph structure learning to adaptively learn complex node dependencies beyond pairwise relations. Meanwhile, based on the learned hypergraph, we introduce a line graph to capture the interaction between hyperedges, thereby better mining the underlying semantic structures. Finally, we develop a relational consistency learning to facilitate knowledge transfer between the two branches and provide better mutual guidance. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Local Feature Encoding for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04755v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in learning from graph-based data. The key mechanism of current GNNs is message passing, where a node's feature is updated based on the information passing from its local neighbourhood. A limitation of this mechanism is that node features become increasingly dominated by the information aggregated from the neighbourhood as we use more rounds of message passing. Consequently, as the GNN layers become deeper, adjacent node features tends to be similar, making it more difficult for GNNs to distinguish adjacent nodes, thereby, limiting the performance of GNNs. In this paper, we propose conditional local feature encoding (CLFE) to help prevent the problem of node features being dominated by the information from local neighbourhood. The idea of our method is to extract the node hidden state embedding from message passing process and concatenate it with the nodes feature from previous stage, then we utilise linear transformation to form a CLFE based on the concatenated vector. The CLFE will form the layer output to better preserve node-specific information, thus help to improve the performance of GNN models. To verify the feasibility of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets for four graph domain tasks: super-pixel graph classification, node classification, link prediction, and graph regression. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method improves model performance across a variety of baseline GNN models for all four tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages |

In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning, contrastive Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential by utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation is still limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators remain sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (GHGCL). Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning enhanced contrastive paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy by using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy for capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest contrastive and generative baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks. To reproduce our work, we have open-sourced our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GC-HGNN-E50C.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8figures |

Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The main obstacle was the ambiguity of conventional crystal representations based on incomplete or discontinuous descriptors that allow false negatives or false positives. This ambiguity was resolved by the ultra-fast Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), which distinguished all periodic structures in the world's largest collection of real materials (Cambridge Structural Database). The state-of-the-art results in property predictions were previously achieved by graph neural networks based on various graph representations of periodic crystals, including the Crystal Graph with vertices at all atoms in a crystal unit cell. This work adapts the Pointwise Distance Distribution for a simpler graph whose vertex set is not larger than the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure. The new Distribution Graph reduces mean-absolute-error by 0.6\%-12\% while having 44\%-88\% of the number of vertices when compared to the crystal graph when applied on the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT datasets using CGCNN and ALIGNN. Methods for hyper-parameters selection for the graph are backed by the theoretical results of the Pointwise Distance Distribution and are then experimentally justified.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures (4 single column, 1 double column)</p></details> |

Active learning for GNNs aims to query the valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation to maximize the GNNs' performance at a lower cost. However, most existing algorithms for reinforced active learning in GNNs may lead to a highly imbalanced class distribution, especially in highly skewed class scenarios. GNNs trained with class-imbalanced labeled data are susceptible to bias toward majority classes, and the lower performance of minority classes may lead to a decline in overall performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel class-balanced and reinforced active learning framework for GNNs, namely, GCBR. It learns an optimal policy to acquire class-balanced and informative nodes for annotation, maximizing the performance of GNNs trained with selected labeled nodes. GCBR designs class-balance-aware states, as well as a reward function that achieves trade-off between model performance and class balance. The reinforcement learning algorithm Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) is employed to learn an optimal policy stably and efficiently. We further upgrade GCBR to GCBR++ by introducing a punishment mechanism to obtain a more class-balanced labeled set. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

| **[Adaptive Least Mean pth Power Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04111v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the presence of impulsive noise, and missing observations, accurate online prediction of time-varying graph signals poses a crucial challenge in numerous application domains. We propose the Adaptive Least Mean $p^{th}$ Power Graph Neural Networks (LMP-GNN), a universal framework combining adaptive filter and graph neural network for online graph signal estimation. LMP-GNN retains the advantage of adaptive filtering in handling noise and missing observations as well as the online update capability. The incorporated graph neural network within the LMP-GNN can train and update filter parameters online instead of predefined filter parameters in previous methods, outputting more accurate prediction results. The adaptive update scheme of the LMP-GNN follows the solution of a $l_p$-norm optimization, rooting to the minimum dispersion criterion, and yields robust estimation results for time-varying graph signals under impulsive noise. A special case of LMP-GNN named the Sign-GNN is also provided and analyzed, Experiment results on two real-world datasets of temperature graph and traffic graph under four different noise distributions prove the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed LMP-GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binarized Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04098v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have a limitation of solely processing features on graph nodes, neglecting data on high-dimensional structures such as edges and triangles. Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) represent higher-order structures using simplicial complexes to break this limitation albeit still lacking time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture on simplicial complexes named Binarized Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (Bi-SCNN) based on the combination of simplicial convolution with a binary-sign forward propagation strategy. The usage of the Hodge Laplacian on a binary-sign forward propagation enables Bi-SCNN to efficiently and effectively represent simplicial features that have higher-order structures than traditional graph node representations. Compared to the previous Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks, the reduced model complexity of Bi-SCNN shortens the execution time without sacrificing the prediction performance and is less prone to the over-smoothing effect. Experimenting with real-world citation and ocean-drifter data confirmed that our proposed Bi-SCNN is efficient and accurate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Click Control in Transformer-based Interactive Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04009v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-point-based interactive segmentation has received widespread attention due to its efficiency. However, it's hard for existing algorithms to obtain precise and robust responses after multiple clicks. In this case, the segmentation results tend to have little change or are even worse than before. To improve the robustness of the response, we propose a structured click intent model based on graph neural networks, which adaptively obtains graph nodes via the global similarity of user-clicked Transformer tokens. Then the graph nodes will be aggregated to obtain structured interaction features. Finally, the dual cross-attention will be used to inject structured interaction features into vision Transformer features, thereby enhancing the control of clicks over segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrated the proposed algorithm can serve as a general structure in improving Transformer-based interactive segmenta?tion performance. The code and data will be released at https://github.com/hahamyt/scc.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[ESIHGNN: Event-State Interactions Infused Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Conversational Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03960v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Emotion Recognition (CER) aims to predict the emotion expressed by an utterance (referred to as an ``event'') during a conversation. Existing graph-based methods mainly focus on event interactions to comprehend the conversational context, while overlooking the direct influence of the speaker's emotional state on the events. In addition, real-time modeling of the conversation is crucial for real-world applications but is rarely considered. Toward this end, we propose a novel graph-based approach, namely Event-State Interactions infused Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (ESIHGNN), which incorporates the speaker's emotional state and constructs a heterogeneous event-state interaction graph to model the conversation. Specifically, a heterogeneous directed acyclic graph neural network is employed to dynamically update and enhance the representations of events and emotional states at each turn, thereby improving conversational coherence and consistency. Furthermore, to further improve the performance of CER, we enrich the graph's edges with external knowledge. Experimental results on four publicly available CER datasets show the superiority of our approach and the effectiveness of the introduced heterogeneous event-state interaction graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutions via Positive Noncommutative Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19872v3)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have gained significant popularity in various heterogeneous graph learning tasks. However, most existing HGNNs rely on spatial domain-based methods to aggregate information, i.e., manually selected meta-paths or some heuristic modules, lacking theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, these methods cannot learn arbitrary valid heterogeneous graph filters within the spectral domain, which have limited expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we present a positive spectral heterogeneous graph convolution via positive noncommutative polynomials. Then, using this convolution, we propose PSHGCN, a novel Positive Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. PSHGCN offers a simple yet effective method for learning valid heterogeneous graph filters. Moreover, we demonstrate the rationale of PSHGCN in the graph optimization framework. We conducted an extensive experimental study to show that PSHGCN can learn diverse heterogeneous graph filters and outperform all baselines on open benchmarks. Notably, PSHGCN exhibits remarkable scalability, efficiently handling large real-world graphs comprising millions of nodes and edges.

Despite their successes, GNNs are limited by neglecting the context of relationships across graphs, i.e., inter-graph relationships. Recognizing the potential to extend this capability, we introduce Relating-Up, a plug-and-play module that enhances GNNs by exploiting inter-graph relationships. This module incorporates a relation-aware encoder and a feedback training strategy. The former enables GNNs to capture relationships across graphs, enriching relation-aware graph representation through collective context. The latter utilizes a feedback loop mechanism for the recursively refinement of these representations, leveraging insights from refining inter-graph dynamics to conduct feedback loop. The synergy between these two innovations results in a robust and versatile module. Relating-Up enhances the expressiveness of GNNs, enabling them to encapsulate a wider spectrum of graph relationships with greater precision. Our evaluations across 16 benchmark datasets demonstrate that integrating Relating-Up into GNN architectures substantially improves performance, positioning Relating-Up as a formidable choice for a broad spectrum of graph representation learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Federated Graph Condensation with Information Bottleneck Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03911v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation, which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has immediately benefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing graph condensation methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge the gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for federated graph condensation, in which we decouple the typical gradient matching process for graph condensation into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching. In this way, the burdensome computation cost in client-side is largely alleviated. Besides, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during the federated training can be utilized to steal the training data under the membership inference attacks (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the federated graph condensation, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently protect membership privacy during training. Meanwhile, it also achieves comparable and even superior performance against existing centralized graph condensation and federated graph learning methods.</p></details> | 13 pages |

We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |

A comprehensive modeling of the security threats and the demonstration of adversarial attacks and defenses on practical AI based O-RAN systems is still in its nascent stages. We begin by conducting threat modeling to pinpoint attack surfaces in O-RAN using an ML-based Connection management application (xApp) as an example. The xApp uses a Graph Neural Network trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning and achieves on average 54% improvement in the coverage rate measured as the 5th percentile user data rates. We then formulate and demonstrate evasion attacks that degrade the coverage rates by as much as 50% through injecting bounded noise at different threat surfaces including the open wireless medium itself. Crucially, we also compare and contrast the effectiveness of such attacks on the ML-based xApp and a non-ML based heuristic. We finally develop and demonstrate robust training-based defenses against the challenging physical/jamming-based attacks and show a 15% improvement in the coverage rates when compared to employing no defense over a range of noise budgets</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Sensitivity under Probabilistic Error Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07831v4)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), have emerged as pivotal instruments in machine learning and signal processing for processing graph-structured data. This paper proposes an analysis framework to investigate the sensitivity of GCNNs to probabilistic graph perturbations, directly impacting the graph shift operator (GSO). Our study establishes tight expected GSO error bounds, which are explicitly linked to the error model parameters, and reveals a linear relationship between GSO perturbations and the resulting output differences at each layer of GCNNs. This linearity demonstrates that a single-layer GCNN maintains stability under graph edge perturbations, provided that the GSO errors remain bounded, regardless of the perturbation scale. For multilayer GCNNs, the dependency of system's output difference on GSO perturbations is shown to be a recursion of linearity. Finally, we exemplify the framework with the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) and Simple Graph Convolution Network (SGCN). Experiments validate our theoretical derivations and the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Nash Equilibrium Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03518v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nash Equilibrium (NE) is the canonical solution concept of game theory, which provides an elegant tool to understand the rationalities. Though mixed strategy NE exists in any game with finite players and actions, computing NE in two- or multi-player general-sum games is PPAD-Complete. Various alternative solutions, e.g., Correlated Equilibrium (CE), and learning methods, e.g., fictitious play (FP), are proposed to approximate NE. For convenience, we call these methods as "inexact solvers", or "solvers" for short. However, the alternative solutions differ from NE and the learning methods generally fail to converge to NE. Therefore, in this work, we propose REinforcement Nash Equilibrium Solver (RENES), which trains a single policy to modify the games with different sizes and applies the solvers on the modified games where the obtained solution is evaluated on the original games. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. i) We represent the games as $\alpha$-rank response graphs and leverage graph neural network (GNN) to handle the games with different sizes as inputs; ii) We use tensor decomposition, e.g., canonical polyadic (CP), to make the dimension of modifying actions fixed for games with different sizes; iii) We train the modifying strategy for games with the widely-used proximal policy optimization (PPO) and apply the solvers to solve the modified games, where the obtained solution is evaluated on original games. Extensive experiments on large-scale normal-form games show that our method can further improve the approximation of NE of different solvers, i.e., $\alpha$-rank, CE, FP and PRD, and can be generalized to unseen games.</p></details> | IJCAI 2024 |
| **[AnchorGT: Efficient and Flexible Attention Architecture for Scalable Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03481v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have significantly advanced the field of graph representation learning by overcoming the limitations of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) and demonstrating promising performance and expressive power. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanism in GTs has limited their scalability, and previous approaches to address this issue often suffer from expressiveness degradation or lack of versatility. To address this issue, we propose AnchorGT, a novel attention architecture for GTs with global receptive field and almost linear complexity, which serves as a flexible building block to improve the scalability of a wide range of GT models. Inspired by anchor-based GNNs, we employ structurally important $k$-dominating node set as anchors and design an attention mechanism that focuses on the relationship between individual nodes and anchors, while retaining the global receptive field for all nodes. With its intuitive design, AnchorGT can easily replace the attention module in various GT models with different network architectures and structural encodings, resulting in reduced computational overhead without sacrificing performance. In addition, we theoretically prove that AnchorGT attention can be strictly more expressive than Weisfeiler-Lehman test, showing its superiority in representing graph structures. Our experiments on three state-of-the-art GT models demonstrate that their AnchorGT variants can achieve better results while being faster and significantly more memory efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Transformers without Positional Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17791v3)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Transformers for graph representation learning have become increasingly popular, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide-variety of graph datasets, either alone or in combination with message-passing graph neural networks (MP-GNNs). Infusing graph inductive-biases in the innately structure-agnostic transformer architecture in the form of structural or positional encodings (PEs) is key to achieving these impressive results. However, designing such encodings is tricky and disparate attempts have been made to engineer such encodings including Laplacian eigenvectors, relative random-walk probabilities (RRWP), spatial encodings, centrality encodings, edge encodings etc. In this work, we argue that such encodings may not be required at all, provided the attention mechanism itself incorporates information about the graph structure. We introduce Eigenformer, a Graph Transformer employing a novel spectrum-aware attention mechanism cognizant of the Laplacian spectrum of the graph, and empirically show that it achieves performance competetive with SOTA Graph Transformers on a number of standard GNN benchmarks. Additionally, we theoretically prove that Eigenformer can express various graph structural connectivity matrices, which is particularly essential when learning over smaller graphs.</p></details> | Independent Research |
| **[A method for quantifying the generalization capabilities of generative models for solving Ising models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03435v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For Ising models with complex energy landscapes, whether the ground state can be found by neural networks depends heavily on the Hamming distance between the training datasets and the ground state. Despite the fact that various recently proposed generative models have shown good performance in solving Ising models, there is no adequate discussion on how to quantify their generalization capabilities. Here we design a Hamming distance regularizer in the framework of a class of generative models, variational autoregressive networks (VAN), to quantify the generalization capabilities of various network architectures combined with VAN. The regularizer can control the size of the overlaps between the ground state and the training datasets generated by networks, which, together with the success rates of finding the ground state, form a quantitative metric to quantify their generalization capabilities. We conduct numerical experiments on several prototypical network architectures combined with VAN, including feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks, to quantify their generalization capabilities when solving Ising models. Moreover, considering the fact that the quantification of the generalization capabilities of networks on small-scale problems can be used to predict their relative performance on large-scale problems, our method is of great significance for assisting in the Neural Architecture Search field of searching for the optimal network architectures when solving large-scale Ising models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Translating Subgraphs to Nodes Makes Simple GNNs Strong and Efficient for Subgraph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04510v3)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph representation learning has emerged as an important problem, but it is by default approached with specialized graph neural networks on a large global graph. These models demand extensive memory and computational resources but challenge modeling hierarchical structures of subgraphs. In this paper, we propose Subgraph-To-Node (S2N) translation, a novel formulation for learning representations of subgraphs. Specifically, given a set of subgraphs in the global graph, we construct a new graph by coarsely transforming subgraphs into nodes. Demonstrating both theoretical and empirical evidence, S2N not only significantly reduces memory and computational costs compared to state-of-the-art models but also outperforms them by capturing both local and global structures of the subgraph. By leveraging graph coarsening methods, our method outperforms baselines even in a data-scarce setting with insufficient subgraphs. Our experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate that fined-tuned models with S2N translation can process 183 -- 711 times more subgraph samples than state-of-the-art models at a better or similar performance level.</p></details> | ICML 2024 (22 pages) |
| **[E2GNN: Efficient Graph Neural Network Ensembles for Semi-Supervised Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03401v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting. Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners. However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons. First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency. Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited. In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes. Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes. Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP. By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance. Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising of Geodetic Time Series Using Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: Application to Slow Slip Event Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03320v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet, as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals. Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coefficient Decomposition for Spectral Graph Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03296v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral graph convolutional network (SGCN) is a kind of graph neural networks (GNN) based on graph signal filters, and has shown compelling expressivity for modeling graph-structured data. Most SGCNs adopt polynomial filters and learn the coefficients from the training data. Many of them focus on which polynomial basis leads to optimal expressive power and models' architecture is little discussed. In this paper, we propose a general form in terms of spectral graph convolution, where the coefficients of polynomial basis are stored in a third-order tensor. Then, we show that the convolution block in existing SGCNs can be derived by performing a certain coefficient decomposition operation on the coefficient tensor. Based on the generalized view, we develop novel spectral graph convolutions CoDeSGC-CP and -Tucker by tensor decomposition CP and Tucker on the coefficient tensor. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed convolutions achieve favorable performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Sensing for Multiuser Beam Tracking with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03129v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs). Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem, because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we harness recent advances offering alternative definitions of causal shifts and convolutions for signals on DAGs. We develop a novel convolutional graph neural network that integrates learnable DAG filters to account for the partial ordering induced by the graph topology, thus providing valuable inductive bias to learn effective representations of DAG-supported data. We discuss the salient advantages and potential limitations of the proposed DAG convolutional network (DCN) and evaluate its performance on two learning tasks using synthetic data: network diffusion estimation and source identification. DCN compares favorably relative to several baselines, showcasing its promising potential.</p></details> |  |

The underlying complexity in textile behavior when being pulled and stretched, is due to both the yarn material properties and the textile construction technique. Today, there are no commonly adopted and annotated datasets on which the various interaction or property identification methods are assessed. One important property that affects the interaction is material elasticity that results from both the yarn material and construction technique: these two are intertwined and, if not known a-priori, almost impossible to identify through sensing commonly available on robotic platforms. We introduce Elastic Context (EC), a concept that integrates various properties that affect elastic behavior, to enable a more effective physical interaction with textiles. The definition of EC relies on stress/strain curves commonly used in textile engineering, which we reformulated for robotic applications. We employ EC using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn generalized elastic behaviors of textiles. Furthermore, we explore the effect the dimension of the EC has on accurate force modeling of non-linear real-world elastic behaviors, highlighting the challenges of current robotic setups to sense textile properties.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises 1,410 videos totaling nearly 24 hours and includes performances from 11 signers. Turkish, an agglutinative language, poses unique challenges for sign language translation, particularly with a vocabulary where 64% are singleton words and 85% are rare words, appearing less than five times. We developed two baseline models to address these challenges: the Pose to Text Transformer (P2T-T) and the Graph Neural Network based Transformer (GNN-T) models. The GNN-T model achieved 19.13% BLEU-1 score and 3.28% BLEU-4 score, presenting a significant challenge compared to existing benchmarks. The P2T-T model, while demonstrating slightly lower performance in BLEU scores, achieved a higher ROUGE-L score of 22.09%. Additionally, we benchmarked our model using the well-known PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset to validate our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, submitted to IEEE conference</p></details> |

To achieve this spatial-temporal alignment, traditional methods depend on external devices to provide localization and clock signals. However, hardware-generated signals could be vulnerable to noise and potentially malicious attack, jeopardizing the precision of spatial-temporal alignment. Rather than relying on external hardwares, this work proposes a novel approach: aligning by recognizing the inherent geometric patterns within the perceptual data of various agents. Following this spirit, we propose a robust collaborative perception system that operates independently of external localization and clock devices. The key module of our system,~\emph{FreeAlign}, constructs a salient object graph for each agent based on its detected boxes and uses a graph neural network to identify common subgraphs between agents, leading to accurate relative pose and time. We validate \emph{FreeAlign} on both real-world and simulated datasets.

Set, on the contrary, stores independent elements. To learn graph representations, current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily use message passing to encode the interconnections. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel graph-to-set conversion method that bijectively transforms interconnected nodes into a set of independent points and then uses a set encoder to learn the graph representation. This conversion method holds dual significance. Firstly, it enables using set encoders to learn from graphs, thereby significantly expanding the design space of GNNs. Secondly, for Transformer, a specific set encoder, we provide a novel and principled approach to inject graph information losslessly, different from all the heuristic structural/positional encoding methods adopted in previous graph transformers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce Point Set Transformer (PST), a transformer architecture that accepts a point set converted from a graph as input. Theoretically, PST exhibits superior expressivity for both short-range substructure counting and long-range shortest path distance tasks compared to existing GNNs. Extensive experiments further validate PST's outstanding real-world performance. Besides Transformer, we also devise a Deepset-based set encoder, which achieves performance comparable to representative GNNs, affirming the versatility of our graph-to-set method.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
