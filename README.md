| **[An Active Learning Framework with a Class Balancing Strategy for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12122v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models for classification tasks often requires labeling numerous samples, which is costly and time-consuming, especially in time series analysis. This research investigates Active Learning (AL) strategies to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for effective time series classification. Traditional AL techniques cannot control the selection of instances per class for labeling, leading to potential bias in classification performance and instance selection, particularly in imbalanced time series datasets. To address this, we propose a novel class-balancing instance selection algorithm integrated with standard AL strategies. Our approach aims to select more instances from classes with fewer labeled examples, thereby addressing imbalance in time series datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our AL framework in selecting informative data samples for two distinct domains of tactile texture recognition and industrial fault detection. In robotics, our method achieves high-performance texture categorization while significantly reducing labeled training data requirements to 70%. We also evaluate the impact of different sliding window time intervals on robotic texture classification using AL strategies. In synthetic fiber manufacturing, we adapt AL techniques to address the challenge of fault classification, aiming to minimize data annotation cost and time for industries. We also address real-life class imbalances in the multiclass industrial anomalous dataset using our class-balancing instance algorithm integrated with AL strategies. Overall, this thesis highlights the potential of our AL framework across these two distinct domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis accepted by Memorial University of Newfoundland.

| **[PATE: Proximity-Aware Time series anomaly Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12096v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating anomaly detection algorithms in time series data is critical as inaccuracies can lead to flawed decision-making in various domains where real-time analytics and data-driven strategies are essential. Traditional performance metrics assume iid data and fail to capture the complex temporal dynamics and specific characteristics of time series anomalies, such as early and delayed detections. We introduce Proximity-Aware Time series anomaly Evaluation (PATE), a novel evaluation metric that incorporates the temporal relationship between prediction and anomaly intervals. PATE uses proximity-based weighting considering buffer zones around anomaly intervals, enabling a more detailed and informed assessment of a detection. Using these weights, PATE computes a weighted version of the area under the Precision and Recall curve. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show the superiority of PATE in providing more sensible and accurate evaluations than other evaluation metrics. We also tested several state-of-the-art anomaly detectors across various benchmark datasets using the PATE evaluation scheme. The results show that a common metric like Point-Adjusted F1 Score fails to characterize the detection performances well, and that PATE is able to provide a more fair model comparison. By introducing PATE, we redefine the understanding of model efficacy that steers future studies toward developing more effective and accurate detection models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (KDD 2024), Research Track.

| **[Adaptive Extraction Network for Multivariate Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12038v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models employing CNN architecture have made significant progress in multivariate long sequence time-series forecasting (MLSTF), particularly in modeling local time series characteristics. However, during the MLSTF process, extracting the global time series patterns and understanding the correlations among different variables are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information across different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture correlated features between variables. Building upon this, we propose ATVCNet, an adaptive temporal-variable convolutional network designed to effectively model the local/global temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies of multivariate time series. Specifically, extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, captures both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed inter-variable feature adaptive extraction module captures the correlation among different variables in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ATVCNet across eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that ATVCNet achieved a performance improvement of approximately 63.4% over state-of-the-art MLSTF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchAD: A Lightweight Patch-based MLP-Mixer for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09793v4)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in time series analysis is a pivotal task, yet it poses the challenge of discerning normal and abnormal patterns in label-deficient scenarios. While prior studies have largely employed reconstruction-based approaches, which limits the models' representational capacities. Moreover, existing deep learning-based methods are not sufficiently lightweight. Addressing these issues, we present PatchAD, our novel, highly efficient multiscale patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that utilizes contrastive learning for representation extraction and anomaly detection. With its four distinct MLP Mixers and innovative dual project constraint module, PatchAD mitigates potential model degradation and offers a lightweight solution, requiring only $3.2$MB. Its efficacy is demonstrated by state-of-the-art results across $9$ datasets sourced from different application scenarios, outperforming over $30$ comparative algorithms. PatchAD significantly improves the classical F1 score by $50.5\%$, the Aff-F1 score by $7.8\%$, and the AUC by $10.0\%$. The code is publicly available. \url{https://github.com/EmorZz1G/PatchAD}</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 14 tables, Under review</p></details> |
| **[Continuous Time Locally Stationary Wavelet Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12788v5)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces the class of continuous time locally stationary wavelet processes. Continuous time models enable us to properly provide scale-based time series models for irregularly-spaced observations for the first time, while also permitting a spectral representation of the process over a continuous range of scales. We derive results for both the theoretical setting, where we assume access to the entire process sample path, and a more practical one, which develops methods for estimating the quantities of interest from sampled time series. The latter estimates are accurately computable in reasonable time by solving the relevant linear integral equation using the iterative thresholding method due to Daubechies, Defrise and De Mol. Appropriate smoothing techniques are also developed and applied in this new setting. We exemplify our new methods by computing spectral and autocovariance estimates on irregularly-spaced heart rate data obtained from a recent sleep-state study.</p></details> | 38 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Identifiability of total effects from abstractions of time series causal graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14691v5)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of identifiability of the total effect of an intervention from observational time series in the situation, common in practice, where one only has access to abstractions of the true causal graph. We consider here two abstractions: the extended summary causal graph, which conflates all lagged causal relations but distinguishes between lagged and instantaneous relations, and the summary causal graph which does not give any indication about the lag between causal relations. We show that the total effect is always identifiable in extended summary causal graphs and provide sufficient conditions for identifiability in summary causal graphs. We furthermore provide adjustment sets allowing to estimate the total effect whenever it is identifiable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |
| **[Boosting MLPs with a Coarsening Strategy for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03199v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have been exerting their strengths in long-term time series forecasting. However, they often struggle to strike a balance between expressive power and computational efficiency. Resorting to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) provides a compromising solution, yet they suffer from two critical problems caused by the intrinsic point-wise mapping mode, in terms of deficient contextual dependencies and inadequate information bottleneck. Here, we propose the Coarsened Perceptron Network (CP-Net), featured by a coarsening strategy that alleviates the above problems associated with the prototype MLPs by forming information granules in place of solitary temporal points. The CP-Net utilizes primarily a two-stage framework for extracting semantic and contextual patterns, which preserves correlations over larger timespans and filters out volatile noises. This is further enhanced by a multi-scale setting, where patterns of diverse granularities are fused towards a comprehensive prediction. Based purely on convolutions of structural simplicity, CP-Net is able to maintain a linear computational complexity and low runtime, while demonstrates an improvement of 4.1% compared with the SOTA method on seven forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi Maximum Likelihood Estimation of High-Dimensional Factor Models: A Critical Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11777v5)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We review Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimation of factor models for high-dimensional panels of time series. We consider two cases: (1) estimation when no dynamic model for the factors is specified (Bai and Li, 2012, 2016); (2) estimation based on the Kalman smoother and the Expectation Maximization algorithm thus allowing to model explicitly the factor dynamics (Doz et al., 2012, Barigozzi and Luciani, 2019). Our interest is in approximate factor models, i.e., when we allow for the idiosyncratic components to be mildly cross-sectionally, as well as serially, correlated. Although such setting apparently makes estimation harder, we show, in fact, that factor models do not suffer of the {\it curse of dimensionality} problem, but instead they enjoy a {\it blessing of dimensionality} property. In particular, given an approximate factor structure, if the cross-sectional dimension of the data, $N$, grows to infinity, we show that: (i) identification of the model is still possible, (ii) the mis-specification error due to the use of an exact factor model log-likelihood vanishes. Moreover, if we let also the sample size, $T$, grow to infinity, we can also consistently estimate all parameters of the model and make inference. The same is true for estimation of the latent factors which can be carried out by weighted least-squares, linear projection, or Kalman filtering/smoothing. We also compare the approaches presented with: Principal Component analysis and the classical, fixed $N$, exact Maximum Likelihood approach. We conclude with a discussion on efficiency of the considered estimators.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2USD: Efficient-yet-effective Unsupervised State Detection for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14041v5)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical system sensors emit multivariate time series (MTS) that monitor physical system processes. Such time series generally capture unknown numbers of states, each with a different duration, that correspond to specific conditions, e.g., "walking" or "running" in human-activity monitoring. Unsupervised identification of such states facilitates storage and processing in subsequent data analyses, as well as enhances result interpretability. Existing state-detection proposals face three challenges. First, they introduce substantial computational overhead, rendering them impractical in resourceconstrained or streaming settings. Second, although state-of-the-art (SOTA) proposals employ contrastive learning for representation, insufficient attention to false negatives hampers model convergence and accuracy. Third, SOTA proposals predominantly only emphasize offline non-streaming deployment, we highlight an urgent need to optimize online streaming scenarios. We propose E2Usd that enables efficient-yet-accurate unsupervised MTS state detection. E2Usd exploits a Fast Fourier Transform-based Time Series Compressor (fftCompress) and a Decomposed Dual-view Embedding Module (ddEM) that together encode input MTSs at low computational overhead. Additionally, we propose a False Negative Cancellation Contrastive Learning method (fnccLearning) to counteract the effects of false negatives and to achieve more cluster-friendly embedding spaces. To reduce computational overhead further in streaming settings, we introduce Adaptive Threshold Detection (adaTD). Comprehensive experiments with six baselines and six datasets offer evidence that E2Usd is capable of SOTA accuracy at significantly reduced computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Application of time-series quantum generative model to financial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11795v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite proposing a quantum generative model for time series that successfully learns correlated series with multiple Brownian motions, the model has not been adapted and evaluated for financial problems. In this study, a time-series generative model was applied as a quantum generative model to actual financial data. Future data for two correlated time series were generated and compared with classical methods such as long short-term memory and vector autoregression. Furthermore, numerical experiments were performed to complete missing values. Based on the results, we evaluated the practical applications of the time-series quantum generation model. It was observed that fewer parameter values were required compared with the classical method. In addition, the quantum time-series generation model was feasible for both stationary and nonstationary data. These results suggest that several parameters can be applied to various types of time-series data.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Diffusion Models for Generating Ballistic Spacecraft Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11738v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling has drawn much attention in creative and scientific data generation tasks. Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |
| **[Physical-aware Cross-modal Adversarial Network for Wearable Sensor-based Human Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03638v2)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable sensor-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) has made significant strides in recent times. However, the accuracy performance of wearable sensor-based HAR is currently still lagging behind that of visual modalities-based systems, such as RGB video and depth data. Although diverse input modalities can provide complementary cues and improve the accuracy performance of HAR, wearable devices can only capture limited kinds of non-visual time series input, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. This limitation hinders the deployment of multimodal simultaneously using visual and non-visual modality data in parallel on current wearable devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel Physical-aware Cross-modal Adversarial (PCA) framework that utilizes only time-series accelerometer data from four inertial sensors for the wearable sensor-based HAR problem. Specifically, we propose an effective IMU2SKELETON network to produce corresponding synthetic skeleton joints from accelerometer data. Subsequently, we imposed additional constraints on the synthetic skeleton data from a physical perspective, as accelerometer data can be regarded as the second derivative of the skeleton sequence coordinates. After that, the original accelerometer as well as the constrained skeleton sequence were fused together to make the final classification. In this way, when individuals wear wearable devices, the devices can not only capture accelerometer data, but can also generate synthetic skeleton sequences for real-time wearable sensor-based HAR applications that need to be conducted anytime and anywhere. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PCA framework, we conduct extensive experiments on Berkeley-MHAD, UTD-MHAD, and MMAct datasets. The results confirm that the proposed PCA approach has competitive performance compared to the previous methods on the mono sensor-based HAR classification problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We will be making some significant changes to the paper, including the title and methodology.

| **[Nonparametric data segmentation in multivariate time series via joint characteristic functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07581v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern time series data often exhibit complex dependence and structural changes which are not easily characterised by shifts in the mean or model parameters. We propose a nonparametric data segmentation methodology for multivariate time series termed NP-MOJO. By considering joint characteristic functions between the time series and its lagged values, NP-MOJO is able to detect change points in the marginal distribution, but also those in possibly non-linear serial dependence, all without the need to pre-specify the type of changes. We show the theoretical consistency of NP-MOJO in estimating the total number and the locations of the change points, and demonstrate the good performance of NP-MOJO against a variety of change point scenarios. We further demonstrate its usefulness in applications to seismology and economic time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Statistical Feature-Guided Diffusion Model for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05285v2)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human activity recognition (HAR) from on-body sensors is a core functionality in many AI applications: from personal health, through sports and wellness to Industry 4.0. A key problem holding up progress in wearable sensor-based HAR, compared to other ML areas, such as computer vision, is the unavailability of diverse and labeled training data. Particularly, while there are innumerable annotated images available in online repositories, freely available sensor data is sparse and mostly unlabeled. We propose an unsupervised statistical feature-guided diffusion model specifically optimized for wearable sensor-based human activity recognition with devices such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. The method generates synthetic labeled time-series sensor data without relying on annotated training data. Thereby, it addresses the scarcity and annotation difficulties associated with real-world sensor data. By conditioning the diffusion model on statistical information such as mean, standard deviation, Z-score, and skewness, we generate diverse and representative synthetic sensor data. We conducted experiments on public human activity recognition datasets and compared the method to conventional oversampling and state-of-the-art generative adversarial network methods. Experimental results demonstrate that this can improve the performance of human activity recognition and outperform existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[VCformer: Variable Correlation Transformer with Inherent Lagged Correlation for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11470v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has been extensively applied across diverse domains, such as weather prediction and energy consumption. However, current studies still rely on the vanilla point-wise self-attention mechanism to capture cross-variable dependencies, which is inadequate in extracting the intricate cross-correlation implied between variables. To fill this gap, we propose Variable Correlation Transformer (VCformer), which utilizes Variable Correlation Attention (VCA) module to mine the correlations among variables. Specifically, based on the stochastic process theory, VCA calculates and integrates the cross-correlation scores corresponding to different lags between queries and keys, thereby enhancing its ability to uncover multivariate relationships. Additionally, inspired by Koopman dynamics theory, we also develop Koopman Temporal Detector (KTD) to better address the non-stationarity in time series. The two key components enable VCformer to extract both multivariate correlations and temporal dependencies. Our extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VCformer, achieving top-tier performance compared to other state-of-the-art baseline models. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/CSyyn/VCformer.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[GinAR: An End-To-End Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Model Suitable for Variable Missing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11333v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is crucial for decision-making to precisely forecast the future values/trends, based on the complex relationships identified from historical observations of multiple sequences. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2024 (Research track)</p></details> |
| **[SimAD: A Simple Dissimilarity-based Approach for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11238v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevalence of reconstruction-based deep learning methods, time series anomaly detection remains challenging. Existing approaches often struggle with limited temporal contexts, inadequate representation of normal patterns, and flawed evaluation metrics, hindering their effectiveness in identifying aberrant behavior. To address these issues, we introduce $\textbf{{SimAD}}$, a $\textbf{{Sim}}$ple dissimilarity-based approach for time series $\textbf{{A}}$nomaly $\textbf{{D}}$etection. SimAD incorporates an advanced feature extractor adept at processing extended temporal windows, utilizes the EmbedPatch encoder to integrate normal behavioral patterns comprehensively, and introduces an innovative ContrastFusion module designed to accentuate distributional divergences between normal and abnormal data, thereby enhancing the robustness of anomaly discrimination. Additionally, we propose two robust evaluation metrics, UAff and NAff, addressing the limitations of existing metrics and demonstrating their reliability through theoretical and experimental analyses. Experiments across $\textbf{seven}$ diverse time series datasets demonstrate SimAD's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative improvements of $\textbf{19.85%}$ on F1, $\textbf{4.44%}$ on Aff-F1, $\textbf{77.79%}$ on NAff-F1, and $\textbf{9.69%}$ on AUC on six multivariate datasets.

| **[Lag Selection for Univariate Time Series Forecasting using Deep Learning: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11237v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most forecasting methods use recent past observations (lags) to model the future values of univariate time series. Selecting an adequate number of lags is important for training accurate forecasting models. Several approaches and heuristics have been devised to solve this task. However, there is no consensus about what the best approach is. Besides, lag selection procedures have been developed based on local models and classical forecasting techniques such as ARIMA. We bridge this gap in the literature by carrying out an extensive empirical analysis of different lag selection methods. We focus on deep learning methods trained in a global approach, i.e., on datasets comprising multiple univariate time series. The experiments were carried out using three benchmark databases that contain a total of 2411 univariate time series. The results indicate that the lag size is a relevant parameter for accurate forecasts. In particular, excessively small or excessively large lag sizes have a considerable negative impact on forecasting performance. Cross-validation approaches show the best performance for lag selection, but this performance is comparable with simple heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual spectrum: Brain functional connectivity detection beyond coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19461v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coherence is a widely used measure to assess linear relationships between time series. However, it fails to capture nonlinear dependencies. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the notion of residual spectral density as a higher-order extension of the squared coherence. The method is based on an orthogonal decomposition of time series regression models. We propose a test for the existence of the residual spectrum and derive its fundamental properties. A numerical study illustrates finite sample performance of the proposed method. An application of the method shows that the residual spectrum can effectively detect brain connectivity. Our study reveals a noteworthy contrast in connectivity patterns between schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals. Specifically, we observed that non-linear connectivity in schizophrenia patients surpasses that of healthy individuals, which stands in stark contrast to the established understanding that linear connectivity tends to be higher in healthy individuals. This finding sheds new light on the intricate dynamics of brain connectivity in schizophrenia.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaWaveNet: Adaptive Wavelet Network for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11124v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data analysis is a critical component in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and meteorology. Despite the progress in deep learning for time series analysis, there remains a challenge in addressing the non-stationary nature of time series data. Traditional models, which are built on the assumption of constant statistical properties over time, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics in realistic time series, resulting in bias and error in time series analysis. This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 datasets across 3 different tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and a newly established super-resolution task. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaWaveNet over existing methods in all three tasks, which illustrates its potential in various real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We define the notion of a first-order changepoint for a time series of networks, and construct a family of latent position process networks with underlying first-order changepoints. We prove that a spectral estimate of the associated Euclidean mirror localizes these changepoints, even when the graph distribution evolves continuously, but at a rate that changes. Simulated and real data examples on organoid networks show that this localization captures empirically significant shifts in network evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[WEITS: A Wavelet-enhanced residual framework for interpretable time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10877v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series (TS) forecasting has been an unprecedentedly popular problem in recent years, with ubiquitous applications in both scientific and business fields. Various approaches have been introduced to time series analysis, including both statistical approaches and deep neural networks. Although neural network approaches have illustrated stronger ability of representation than statistical methods, they struggle to provide sufficient interpretablility, and can be too complicated to optimize. In this paper, we present WEITS, a frequency-aware deep learning framework that is highly interpretable and computationally efficient. Through multi-level wavelet decomposition, WEITS novelly infuses frequency analysis into a highly deep learning framework. Combined with a forward-backward residual architecture, it enjoys both high representation capability and statistical interpretability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated competitive performance of our model, along with its additional advantage of high computation efficiency. Furthermore, WEITS provides a general framework that can always seamlessly integrate with state-of-the-art approaches for time series forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.09488 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Matrix Autoregressive Model with Vector Time Series Covariates for Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15671v3)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a new methodology for forecasting matrix-valued time series with historical matrix data and auxiliary vector time series data. We focus on a time series of matrices defined on a static 2-D spatial grid and an auxiliary time series of non-spatial vectors. The proposed model, Matrix AutoRegression with Auxiliary Covariates (MARAC), contains an autoregressive component for the historical matrix predictors and an additive component that maps the auxiliary vector predictors to a matrix response via tensor-vector product. The autoregressive component adopts a bi-linear transformation framework following Chen et al. (2021), significantly reducing the number of parameters. The auxiliary component posits that the tensor coefficient, which maps non-spatial predictors to a spatial response, contains slices of spatially smooth matrix coefficients that are discrete evaluations of smooth functions from a Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose to estimate the model parameters under a penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework coupled with an alternating minimization algorithm. We establish the joint asymptotics of the autoregressive and tensor parameters under fixed and high-dimensional regimes. Extensive simulations and a geophysical application for forecasting the global Total Electron Content (TEC) are conducted to validate the performance of MARAC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model (LLM) for Telecommunications: A Comprehensive Survey on Principles, Key Techniques, and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10825v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable attention recently due to their outstanding comprehension and reasoning capabilities, leading to great progress in many fields. The advancement of LLM techniques also offers promising opportunities to automate many tasks in the telecommunication (telecom) field. After pre-training and fine-tuning, LLMs can perform diverse downstream tasks based on human instructions, paving the way to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled 6G. Given the great potential of LLM technologies, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-enabled telecom networks. In particular, we first present LLM fundamentals, including model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, model evaluation, and telecom deployment. Then, we introduce LLM-enabled key techniques and telecom applications in terms of generation, classification, optimization, and prediction problems. Specifically, the LLM-enabled generation applications include telecom domain knowledge, code, and network configuration generation. After that, the LLM-based classification applications involve network security, text, image, and traffic classification problems. Moreover, multiple LLM-enabled optimization techniques are introduced, such as automated reward function design for reinforcement learning and verbal reinforcement learning.

Unlike conventional applications of decision trees that forecast time series directly, Hyper-Trees are designed to learn the parameters of a target time series model. Our framework leverages the gradient-based nature of boosted trees, which allows us to extend the concept of Hyper-Networks to Hyper-Trees and to induce a time-series inductive bias to tree models. By relating the parameters of a target time series model to features, Hyper-Trees address the issue of parameter non-stationarity and enable tree-based forecasts to extend beyond their training range. With our research, we aim to explore the effectiveness of Hyper-Trees across various forecasting scenarios and to extend the application of gradient boosted decision trees outside their conventional use in time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forec...</summary><p>Forecasting, Gradient Boosting, Hyper-Networks, LightGBM, Parameter Non-Stationarity, Time Series, XGBoost</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting superior interpretability.

Over the past few years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, LTSF faces inherent challenges such as long-term dependencies capturing and sparse semantic characteristics. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba has shown great potential in balancing predicting performance and computational efficiency compared to Transformers. To enhance Mamba's ability to preserve historical information in a longer range, we design a novel Mamba+ block by adding a forget gate inside Mamba to selectively combine the new features with the historical features in a complementary manner. Furthermore, we apply Mamba+ both forward and backward and propose Bi-Mamba+, aiming to promote the model's ability to capture interactions among time series elements. Additionally, multivariate time series data in different scenarios may exhibit varying emphasis on intra- or inter-series dependencies. Therefore, we propose a series-relation-aware decider that controls the utilization of channel-independent or channel-mixing tokenization strategy for specific datasets. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model achieves more accurate predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>New M...</summary><p>New Mamba-based architecture.

The search for the best segmentation can be expressed as a minimization problem over a given cost function. We focus on dynamic programming algorithms that solve this problem exactly. When the number of changes is proportional to data length, an inequality-based pruning rule encoded in the PELT algorithm leads to a linear time complexity. Another type of pruning, called functional pruning, gives a close-to-linear time complexity whatever the number of changes, but only for the analysis of univariate time series. We propose a few extensions of functional pruning for multiple independent time series based on the use of simple geometric shapes (balls and hyperrectangles). We focus on the Gaussian case, but some of our rules can be easily extended to the exponential family. In a simulation study we compare the computational efficiency of different geometric-based pruning rules. We show that for small dimensions (2, 3, 4) some of them ran significantly faster than inequality-based approaches in particular when the underlying number of changes is small compared to the data length.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Results are derived under a minimal set of assumptions and, in particular, we require only the existence of 4th order moments. A special focus is given to the time series setting, a case considered in almost all recent econometric applications of factor models. Hence, estimation is based on the classical $n\times n$ sample covariance matrix and not on a $T\times T$ covariance matrix often considered in the literature. Indeed, despite the two approaches being asymptotically equivalent, the former is more coherent with a time series setting and it immediately allows us to write more intuitive asymptotic expansions for the Principal Component estimators showing that they are equivalent to OLS as long as $\sqrt n/T\to 0$ and $\sqrt T/n\to 0$, that is the loadings are estimated in a time series regression as if the factors were known, while the factors are estimated in a cross-sectional regression as if the loadings were known. Finally, we give some alternative sets of primitive sufficient conditions for mean-squared consistency of the sample covariance matrix of the factors, of the idiosyncratic components, and of the observed time series, which is the starting point for Principal Component Analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2211.01921 which is written by the same author.

Ensuring the optimal performance of a spacecraft requires the early detection and mitigation of anomalies, which could otherwise result in unit or mission failures. With the advent of deep learning, a surge of interest has been seen in leveraging these sophisticated algorithms for anomaly detection in space operations. This study aims to compare the efficacy of various deep learning architectures in detecting anomalies in spacecraft data. The deep learning models under investigation include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based architectures. Each of these models was trained and validated using a comprehensive dataset sourced from multiple spacecraft missions, encompassing diverse operational scenarios and anomaly types. Initial results indicate that while CNNs excel in identifying spatial patterns and may be effective for some classes of spacecraft data, LSTMs and RNNs show a marked proficiency in capturing temporal anomalies seen in time-series spacecraft telemetry. The Transformer-based architectures, given their ability to focus on both local and global contexts, have showcased promising results, especially in scenarios where anomalies are subtle and span over longer durations. Additionally, considerations such as computational efficiency, ease of deployment, and real-time processing capabilities were evaluated. While CNNs and LSTMs demonstrated a balance between accuracy and computational demands, Transformer architectures, though highly accurate, require significant computational resources. In conclusion, the choice of deep learning architecture for spacecraft anomaly detection is highly contingent on the nature of the data, the type of anomalies, and operational constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE Aeroconf 2024.

To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input.

To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information. Besides, we introduce a scalable augmentation algorithm capable of handling datasets with varying lengths, facilitating cross-domain pretraining. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across eleven domains validate the effectiveness of UniCL, demonstrating its high generalization on time-series analysis across various fields.</p></details> |  |

To answer this challenge, we utilize a neural network, which we train to incorporate prior knowledge of the function. In addition, by carefully analyzing the problem, we obtain a bound on the error over the extrapolation domain and define a condition number for this problem that quantifies the level of difficulty of the setup. Compared to other machine learning methods that provide time series prediction, such as transformers, our approach is suitable for setups where the interpolation and extrapolation regions are general subdomains and, in particular, manifolds. In addition, our construction leads to an improved loss function that helps us boost the accuracy and robustness of our neural network. We conduct comprehensive numerical tests and comparisons of our extrapolation versus standard methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios.</p></details> | 32 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Physics-Guided State-Space Model Augmentation Using Weighted Regularized Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10429v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to develop a robust flood prediction model for the city, utilizing water level data at 30-minute intervals from ten USGS gauge stations within the watershed. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, known for its ability to effectively process sequential time-series data, was used.

The results demonstrated a high level of accuracy, with the model explaining 98.2% of the variance in the data. Despite minor discrepancies between predicted and observed values, the GRU model proved to be an effective tool for flood prediction in Ashland City, with potential applications for enhancing disaster preparedness and response efforts in Ashland City.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Integrating LoRA aims to enhance forecasting performance while reducing inefficiencies associated with fine-tuning large models on limited domain-specific data. Our experiments show that LoRA fine-tuning of time series foundational models significantly improves forecasting, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models trained from scratch on similar modalities. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the trade-offs between the number of tunable parameters and forecasting performance and assess the impact of varying LoRA matrix ranks on model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

The model is tailored to deliver precise forecasts of rhythms, a crucial aspect for tasks such as generating musical rhythm. Leveraging reservoir computing, our proposed method is ultimately oriented towards predicting human perception of rhythm. Our network accurately predicts rhythmic signals within the human frequency perception range. The model architecture incorporates primary and intermediate neurons tasked with capturing and transmitting rhythmic information. Two parameter matrices, denoted as c and k, regulate the reservoir's overall dynamics.

To achieve this, we perform in-context learning in latent space utilizing a novel integration of the Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFN) and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) frameworks. We leverage the JEPA framework to create a prediction-optimized latent representation of the underlying stochastic process that generates time series and combines it with contextual learning, using a PFN. Furthermore, we improve on preceding works by utilizing related time series as a context and introducing an abstract time axis. This drastically reduces training time and increases the versatility of the model by allowing any time granularity and forecast horizon. We show that this results in superior zero-shot predictions compared to established baselines. We also demonstrate our latent space produces informative embeddings of both individual time steps and fixed-length summaries of entire series. Finally, we observe the emergence of multi-step patch embeddings without explicit training, suggesting the model actively learns discrete tokens that encode local structures in the data, analogous to vision transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages plus references and appendix, 2 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |

However, commonly used approaches in change-point analysis have mainly been focusing on detecting change-points within an entire time series (off-line methods), or quickest detection of change-points in sequentially observed data (on-line methods). Both classes of methods are concerned with change-points that have already occurred. The arguably more important question of when future change-points may occur, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical model that describes the mechanism of change-point occurrence. Specifically, the model assumes a latent process in the form of a random walk driven by non-negative innovations, and an observed process which behaves differently when the latent process belongs to different regimes. By construction, an occurrence of a change-point is equivalent to hitting a regime threshold by the latent process. Therefore, by predicting when the latent process will hit the next regime threshold, future change-points can be forecasted. The probabilistic properties of the model such as stationarity and ergodicity are established. A composite likelihood-based approach is developed for parameter estimation and model selection. Moreover, we construct the predictor and prediction interval for future change points based on the estimated model.</p></details> | 37 pages, 4 figures |

A typical failure troubleshooting pipeline for microservices consists of two phases: anomaly detection and root cause analysis. While various existing works on root cause analysis require accurate anomaly detection, there is no guarantee of accurate estimation with anomaly detection techniques. Inaccurate anomaly detection results can significantly affect the root cause localization results. To address this challenge, we propose BARO, an end-to-end approach that integrates anomaly detection and root cause analysis for effectively troubleshooting failures in microservice systems. BARO leverages the Multivariate Bayesian Online Change Point Detection technique to model the dependency within multivariate time-series metrics data, enabling it to detect anomalies more accurately. BARO also incorporates a novel nonparametric statistical hypothesis testing technique for robustly identifying root causes, which is less sensitive to the accuracy of anomaly detection compared to existing works. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark microservice systems demonstrate that BARO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both anomaly detection and root cause analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to FSE'24</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate this problem from an information theoretic perspective and show that most existing measures of explainability may suffer from trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. We further present TimeX++, a novel explanation framework that leverages a parametric network to produce explanation-embedded instances that are both in-distributed and label-preserving. We evaluate TimeX++ on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing its performance against leading baselines, and validate its practical efficacy through case studies in a real-world environmental application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that TimeX++ outperforms baselines across all datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often focus on single-image and short-text samples, and when assessing multi-image tasks, they either limit the image count or focus on specific task (e.g time-series captioning), potentially obscuring the performance challenges of MLLMs. To address these limitations, we introduce MileBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to test the MultImodal Long-contExt capabilities of MLLMs. This benchmark comprises not only multimodal long contexts, but also multiple tasks requiring both comprehension and generation. We establish two distinct evaluation sets, diagnostic and realistic, to systematically assess MLLMs' long-context adaptation capacity and their ability to complete tasks in long-context scenarios. Our experimental results, obtained from testing 22 models, revealed that while the closed-source GPT-4o outperforms others, most open-source MLLMs struggle in long-context situations. Interestingly, the performance gap tends to widen with an increase in the number of images. We strongly encourage an intensification of research efforts towards enhancing MLLMs' long-context capabilities, especially in scenarios involving multiple images.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures, 14 tables; We add results of GPT-4o in this version</p></details> |

This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper applies uncertainty time series analysis (UTSA) to analyze a rumor retweeting behavior on Weibo. First, the rumor forwarding is modeled using uncertain time series, including order selection, parameter estimation, residual analysis, uncertainty hypothesis testing and forecast, and the validity of using uncertain time series analysis is further supported by analyzing the characteristics of the residual plot. The experimental results show that the uncertain time series can better predict the next stage of rumor forwarding. The results of the study have important practical significance for rumor management and the management of social media information dissemination.</p></details> | 11 pages,3 figures |

We diagnose that in the extant literature on cyclic time series, a prevalent assumption of Gaussianity for $[\alpha_t\,\, \beta_t]$ imposes inadvertently a severe restriction on the amplitude of the process. Moreover, it is shown that other common distributions may suffer from either similar defects or fail to guarantee the stationarity of $y_t$. To address both of the issues, we propose to introduce a direct stochastic modulation of the amplitude and phase shift in an almost periodic function. We prove that this novel approach may lead, in general, to a stationary (up to any order) time series, and specifically, to a zero-mean stationary time series featuring cyclicity, with a pseudo-cyclical autocovariance function that may even decay at a very slow rate. The proposed process fills an important gap in this type of models and allows for flexible modeling of amplitude and phase shift.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs replace traditional linear weights with spline-parametrized univariate functions, allowing them to learn activation patterns dynamically. We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |

However, it may also involve a lot of irrelevant variables, and this even leads to worse performance than the channel-independent (CI) strategy. This paper combines the strengths of both strategies and proposes the Deep Graph Clustering Transformer (DGCformer) for multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, it first groups these relevant variables by a graph convolutional network integrated with an autoencoder, and a former-latter masked self-attention mechanism is then considered with the CD strategy being applied to each group of variables while the CI one for different groups. Extensive experimental results on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art models, and our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging to capture the long-term dependencies in time series data. To better extract long-term dependencies, We propose Multi Scale Dilated Convolution Network (MSDCN), a method that utilizes a shallow dilated convolution architecture to capture the period and trend characteristics of long time series. We design different convolution blocks with exponentially growing dilations and varying kernel sizes to sample time series data at different scales. Furthermore, we utilize traditional autoregressive model to capture the linear relationships within the data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on eight challenging long-term time series forecasting benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the prior state-of-the-art approaches and shows significant inference speed improvements compared to several strong baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The framework is based on evolving directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), defining a more flexible search space than the existing ones in the literature. It allows mixtures of different classical operations: convolutions, recurrences and dense layers, but also more newfangled operations such as self-attention. Based on this search space we propose neighbourhood and evolution search operators to optimize both the architecture and hyper-parameters of our networks. These search operators can be used with any metaheuristic capable of handling mixed search spaces. We tested our algorithmic framework with an evolutionary algorithm on a time series prediction benchmark. The results demonstrate that our framework was able to find models outperforming the established baseline on numerous datasets.</p></details> |  |

With an increase in training volume and model complexity, it is still a challenging problem to enhance data utilization and explainability of DRL training. This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on the temporal correlations within the time dimension of time series. We propose a novel approach to segment multivariate time series into meaningful subsequences and represent the time series based on these subsequences. Furthermore, the subsequences are employed for causal inference to identify fundamental causal factors that significantly impact training outcomes. We design a module to provide feedback on the causality during DRL training. Several experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in common environments, confirming its ability to enhance the effectiveness of DRL training and impart a certain level of explainability to the training process. Additionally, we extended our approach with priority experience replay algorithm, and experimental results demonstrate the continued effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

All these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solution by industry but they are rarely considered in the comparisons between competing methods which generally exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the case in industrial time-series.

Developing an integrated many-to-many framework leveraging multimodal data for multiple tasks is essential to unifying modern medicine. We introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning from tabular, time-series, language, and vision data for supervised binary/multiclass classification, regression, and unsupervised clustering. M3H encompasses an unprecedented range of medical tasks and problem domains and consistently outperforms traditional single-task models by on average 11.6% across 40 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments, three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task. It features a novel attention mechanism balancing self-exploitation (learning source-task), and cross-exploration (learning cross-tasks), and offers explainability through a proposed TIM score, shedding light on the dynamics of task learning interdependencies. Its adaptable architecture supports easy customization and integration of new data modalities and tasks, establishing it as a robust, scalable solution for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.</p></details> |  |

Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024.

| **[How Inverse Conditional Flows Can Serve as a Substitute for Distributional Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05429v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression, are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.</p></details> | Accepted at UAI 2024 |
| **[Comparative Study of Bitcoin Price Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08089v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of stock prices has been a crucial and challenging task, especially in the case of highly volatile digital currencies such as Bitcoin. This research examineS the potential of using neural network models, namely LSTMs and GRUs, to forecast Bitcoin's price movements. We employ five-fold cross-validation to enhance generalization and utilize L2 regularization to reduce overfitting and noise. Our study demonstrates that the GRUs models offer better accuracy than LSTMs model for predicting Bitcoin's price. Specifically, the GRU model has an MSE of 4.67, while the LSTM model has an MSE of 6.25 when compared to the actual prices in the test set data. This finding indicates that GRU models are better equipped to process sequential data with long-term dependencies, a characteristic of financial time series data such as Bitcoin prices. In summary, our results provide valuable insights into the potential of neural network models for accurate Bitcoin price prediction and emphasize the importance of employing appropriate regularization techniques to enhance model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMAFD: An Interpretable Multi-stage Approach to Flood Detection from time series Multispectral Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07916v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address two critical challenges in the domain of flood detection: the computational expense of large-scale time series change detection and the lack of interpretable decision-making processes on explainable AI (XAI). To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed. It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process. The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation. It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation. The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making. Our contributions are two folder. First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection. Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations. The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval. For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight.</p></details> |  |

The Hurst exponent of the fractional process is unknown. The asymptotic theory under infill asymptotics builds upon extreme value theory for weakly dependent, stationary time series and extends techniques for the semimartingale case from the literature. It is shown that the statistic on which the test is based on weakly converges to a Gumbel distribution under the null hypothesis of no jumps. We prove consistency under the alternative hypothesis when there are jumps. Moreover, we establish convergence rates for local alternatives and consistent estimation of jump times. In the process, we show that inference on the Hurst exponent of a rough fractional process is robust with respect to jumps. This provides an important insight for the growing literature on rough volatility. We demonstrate sound finite-sample properties in a simulation study and showcase the applicability of our methods in an empirical example with a time series of volatilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Embedded Time-Series Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15730v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) should produce synthetic data that fits the underlying distribution of the data being modeled. For real valued time-series data, this implies the need to simultaneously capture the static distribution of the data, but also the full temporal distribution of the data for any potential time horizon. This temporal element produces a more complex problem that can potentially leave current solutions under-constrained, unstable during training, or prone to varying degrees of mode collapse. In FETSGAN, entire sequences are translated directly to the generator's sampling space using a seq2seq style adversarial auto encoder (AAE), where adversarial training is used to match the training distribution in both the feature space and the lower dimensional sampling space. This additional constraint provides a loose assurance that the temporal distribution of the synthetic samples will not collapse. In addition, the First Above Threshold (FAT) operator is introduced to supplement the reconstruction of encoded sequences, which improves training stability and the overall quality of the synthetic data being generated. These novel contributions demonstrate a significant improvement to the current state of the art for adversarial learners in qualitative measures of temporal similarity and quantitative predictive ability of data generated through FETSGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final Manuscript.

| **[Generative Modeling of Regular and Irregular Time Series Data via Koopman VAEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02619v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series data is important for many engineering and scientific applications. Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Leveraging the power of Association Rule Mining (ARM), this research endeavors to unravel the underlying dynamics of collaboration among citizen scientists. By meticulously quantifying tag associations and scrutinizing their temporal dynamics, the study provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how non-experts collaborate to generate valuable scientific insights. Furthermore, this investigation extends its purview to examine the phenomenon of ideological convergence within online citizen science knowledge production. To accomplish this, a novel measurement algorithm, based on the Mann-Kendall Trend Test, is introduced. This innovative approach sheds illuminating light on the dynamics of collaborative knowledge production, revealing both the vast opportunities and daunting challenges inherent in leveraging non-expert contributions for scientific research endeavors. Notably, the study uncovers a robust pattern of convergence in ideology, employing both the newly proposed convergence testing method and the traditional approach based on the stationarity of time series data. This groundbreaking discovery holds significant implications for understanding the dynamics of online citizen science communities and underscores the crucial role played by non-experts in shaping the scientific landscape of the digital age. Ultimately, this study contributes significantly to our understanding of online citizen science communities, highlighting their potential to harness collective intelligence for tackling complex scientific tasks and enriching our comprehension of collaborative knowledge production processes in the digital age.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepHYDRA: Resource-Efficient Time-Series Anomaly Detection in Dynamically-Configured Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07749v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in distributed systems such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters is vital for early fault detection, performance optimisation, security monitoring, reliability in general but also operational insights. Deep Neural Networks have seen successful use in detecting long-term anomalies in multidimensional data, originating for instance from industrial or medical systems, or weather prediction. A downside of such methods is that they require a static input size, or lose data through cropping, sampling, or other dimensionality reduction methods, making deployment on systems with variability on monitored data channels, such as computing clusters difficult. To address these problems, we present DeepHYDRA (Deep Hybrid DBSCAN/Reduction-Based Anomaly Detection) which combines DBSCAN and learning-based anomaly detection. DBSCAN clustering is used to find point anomalies in time-series data, mitigating the risk of missing outliers through loss of information when reducing input data to a fixed number of channels. A deep learning-based time-series anomaly detection method is then applied to the reduced data in order to identify long-term outliers. This hybrid approach reduces the chances of missing anomalies that might be made indistinguishable from normal data by the reduction process, and likewise enables the algorithm to be scalable and tolerate partial system failures while retaining its detection capabilities. Using a subset of the well-known SMD dataset family, a modified variant of the Eclipse dataset, as well as an in-house dataset with a large variability in active data channels, made publicly available with this work, we furthermore analyse computational intensity, memory footprint, and activation counts. DeepHYDRA is shown to reliably detect different types of anomalies in both large and complex datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we establish the central limit theorem (CLT) for spiked eigenvalues of high-dimensional sample autocovariance matrices, which are developed under general conditions. The spiked eigenvalues are allowed to go to infinity in a flexible way without restrictions in divergence order. Moreover, the number of spiked eigenvalues and the time lag of the autocovariance matrix under this study could be either fixed or tending to infinity when the dimension p and the time length T go to infinity together. As a further statistical application, a novel autocovariance test is proposed to detect the equivalence of spiked eigenvalues for two high-dimensional time series. Various simulation studies are illustrated to justify the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a hierarchical clustering approach based on the autocovariance test is constructed and applied to clustering mortality data from multiple countries.</p></details> |  |

The scarcity of labeled data for such tasks has increased the attention towards unsupervised learning methods. These approaches, often relying solely on reconstruction error, typically fail to detect subtle anomalies in complex datasets. To address this, we introduce RESTAD, an adaptation of the Transformer model by incorporating a layer of Radial Basis Function (RBF) neurons within its architecture. This layer fits a non-parametric density in the latent representation, such that a high RBF output indicates similarity with predominantly normal training data. RESTAD integrates the RBF similarity scores with the reconstruction errors to increase sensitivity to anomalies. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that RESTAD outperforms various established baselines across multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review</p></details> |

Although stationary electricity-price forecasting techniques have received considerable attention, research on non-stationary methods is comparatively scarce, despite the common prevalence of non-stationary features in electricity markets. Specifically, existing non-stationary techniques will often aim to address individual non-stationary features in isolation, leaving aside the exploration of concurrent multiple non-stationary effects. Our overarching objective here is the formulation of a framework to systematically model and forecast non-stationary electricity-price time series, encompassing the broader scope of non-stationary behavior. For this purpose we develop a data-driven model that combines an N-dimensional Langevin equation (LE) with a neural-ordinary differential equation (NODE). The LE captures fine-grained details of the electricity-price behavior in stationary regimes but is inadequate for non-stationary conditions. To overcome this inherent limitation, we adopt a NODE approach to learn, and at the same time predict, the difference between the actual electricity-price time series and the simulated price trajectories generated by the LE. By learning this difference, the NODE reconstructs the non-stationary components of the time series that the LE is not able to capture. We exemplify the effectiveness of our framework using the Spanish electricity day-ahead market as a prototypical case study. Our findings reveal that the NODE nicely complements the LE, providing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stationary and non-stationary electricity-price behavior. The framework's dependability and robustness is demonstrated through different non-stationary scenarios by comparing it against a range of basic naive methods.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

However, the difficulty of extracting physical understanding from ML-based models complicates their utility for enhancing scientific knowledge regarding system structure and function. Here, we propose a physically-interpretable Mass Conserving Perceptron (MCP) as a way to bridge the gap between PC-based and ML-based modeling approaches. The MCP exploits the inherent isomorphism between the directed graph structures underlying both PC models and GRNNs to explicitly represent the mass-conserving nature of physical processes while enabling the functional nature of such processes to be directly learned (in an interpretable manner) from available data using off-the-shelf ML technology. As a proof of concept, we investigate the functional expressivity (capacity) of the MCP, explore its ability to parsimoniously represent the rainfall-runoff (RR) dynamics of the Leaf River Basin, and demonstrate its utility for scientific hypothesis testing. To conclude, we discuss extensions of the concept to enable ML-based physical-conceptual representation of the coupled nature of mass-energy-information flows through geoscientific systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>68 pa...</summary><p>68 pages, 7 figures in the main text, 10 figures, and 10 tables in the supplementary materials</p></details> |

| **[Learning Multi-Frequency Partial Correlation Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15756v2)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the large research effort devoted to learning dependencies between time series, the state of the art still faces a major limitation: existing methods learn partial correlations but fail to discriminate across distinct frequency bands. Motivated by many applications in which this differentiation is pivotal, we overcome this limitation by learning a block-sparse, frequency-dependent, partial correlation graph, in which layers correspond to different frequency bands, and partial correlations can occur over just a few layers. To this aim, we formulate and solve two nonconvex learning problems: the first has a closed-form solution and is suitable when there is prior knowledge about the number of partial correlations; the second hinges on an iterative solution based on successive convex approximation, and is effective for the general case where no prior knowledge is available. Numerical results on synthetic data show that the proposed methods outperform the current state of the art. Finally, the analysis of financial time series confirms that partial correlations exist only within a few frequency bands, underscoring how our methods enable the gaining of valuable insights that would be undetected without discriminating along the frequency domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Position: Quo Vadis, Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02678v2)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current state of machine learning scholarship in Timeseries Anomaly Detection (TAD) is plagued by the persistent use of flawed evaluation metrics, inconsistent benchmarking practices, and a lack of proper justification for the choices made in novel deep learning-based model designs. Our paper presents a critical analysis of the status quo in TAD, revealing the misleading track of current research and highlighting problematic methods, and evaluation practices. Our position advocates for a shift in focus from solely pursuing novel model designs to improving benchmarking practices, creating non-trivial datasets, and critically evaluating the utility of complex methods against simpler baselines. Our findings demonstrate the need for rigorous evaluation protocols, the creation of simple baselines, and the revelation that state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection models effectively learn linear mappings. These findings suggest the need for more exploration and development of simple and interpretable TAD methods. The increment of model complexity in the state-of-the-art deep-learning based models unfortunately offers very little improvement. We offer insights and suggestions for the field to move forward.

| **[Factor Strength Estimation in Vector and Matrix Time Series Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07294v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most factor modelling research in vector or matrix-valued time series assume all factors are pervasive/strong and leave weaker factors and their corresponding series to the noise. Weaker factors can in fact be important to a group of observed variables, for instance a sector factor in a large portfolio of stocks may only affect particular sectors, but can be important both in interpretations and predictions for those stocks. While more recent factor modelling researches do consider ``local'' factors which are weak factors with sparse corresponding factor loadings, there are real data examples in the literature where factors are weak because of weak influence on most/all observed variables, so that the corresponding factor loadings are not sparse (non-local). As a first in the literature, we propose estimators of factor strengths for both local and non-local weak factors, and prove their consistency with rates of convergence spelt out for both vector and matrix-valued time series factor models. Factor strength has an important indication in what estimation procedure of factor models to follow, as well as the estimation accuracy of various estimators (Chen and Lam, 2024). Simulation results show that our estimators have good performance in recovering the true factor strengths, and an analysis on the NYC taxi traffic data indicates the existence of weak factors in the data which may not be localized.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Generating Ballistic Spacecraft Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11738v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling has drawn much attention in creative and scientific data generation tasks. Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Clustering Functional Trajectories over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11358v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional concurrent, or varying-coefficient, regression models are commonly used in biomedical and clinical settings to investigate how the relation between an outcome and observed covariate varies as a function of another covariate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |
| **[Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11252v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Maritime Trajectory Forecasting via H3 Index and Causal Language Modelling (CLM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09596v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of ship trajectories is a growing field of study in artificial intelligence. Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, a terrestrial-aerial path-searching method with the crawling limitation of HyFCQs is proposed to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of trajectories. Additionally, a trajectory tracking method is proposed to address the challenges associated with the deformation time required by HyFCQs, which makes tracking hybrid trajectories at the junction between terrestrial and aerial segments difficult.

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Creating Geospatial Trajectories from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06130v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trafficking is a crime that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, sending raw data containing personal, sensitive information to cloud computing nodes may lead to privacy exposure issue.The privacy-preserving matrix completion is a useful approach to perform matrix completion while preserving privacy. In this paper, we propose a high-performance method for privacy-preserving matrix completion. First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

| **[A Weighted Least-Squares Method for Non-Asymptotic Identification of Markov Parameters from Multiple Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04258v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov parameters play a key role in system identification. There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |

Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

Supervised neural models represent the current state-of-the-art. Recent security applications require this task to be rapidly employed in environments that may differ from the data used to train such models for which there is little training data. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to support eventual deployment in security applications. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset.

Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |

This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |
| **[PTT: Point-Trajectory Transformer for Efficient Temporal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08371v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent temporal LiDAR-based 3D object detectors achieve promising performance based on the two-stage proposal-based approach. They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Conditional Shift-Robust Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11968v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as potent tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data. Despite their efficacy, a significant drawback of GNNs lies in their limited ability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, posing challenges to their reliability in contexts where errors carry significant consequences. Moreover, GNNs typically excel in in-distribution settings, assuming that training and test data follow identical distributions: a condition often unmet in real-world graph data scenarios. In this article, we leverage conformal prediction, a widely recognized statistical technique for quantifying uncertainty by transforming predictive model outputs into prediction sets, to address uncertainty quantification in GNN predictions amidst conditional shift \footnote{Representing the change in conditional probability distribution $P(label |input)$ from source domain to target domain.} in graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Additionally, we propose a novel loss function aimed at refining model predictions by minimizing conditional shift in latent stages. Termed Conditional Shift Robust (CondSR) conformal prediction for GNNs, our approach CondSR is model-agnostic and adaptable to various classification models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on standard graph benchmark datasets, integrating it with state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification tasks. The code implementation is publicly available for further exploration and experimentation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
