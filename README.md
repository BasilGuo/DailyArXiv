| **[An Open-Source Tool for Mapping War Destruction at Scale in Ukraine using Sentinel-1 Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02506v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access to detailed war impact assessments is crucial for humanitarian organizations to effectively assist populations most affected by armed conflicts. However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in conflicts that cover vast territories and extend over long periods. This study presents a scalable and transferable method for estimating war-induced damage to buildings. We first train a machine learning model to output pixel-wise probability of destruction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite image time series, leveraging existing, manual damage assessments as ground truth and cloud-based geospatial analysis tools for large-scale inference. We further post-process these assessments using open building footprints to obtain a final damage estimate per building. We introduce an accessible, open-source tool that allows users to adjust the confidence interval based on their specific requirements and use cases. Our approach enables humanitarian organizations and other actors to rapidly screen large geographic regions for war impacts. We provide two publicly accessible dashboards: a Ukraine Damage Explorer to dynamically view our pre-computed estimates, and a Rapid Damage Mapping Tool to easily run our method and produce custom maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series: Bridging Predictive Power and Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02496v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is a groundbreaking model recently proposed by the MIT team, representing a revolutionary approach with the potential to be a game-changer in the field. This innovative concept has rapidly garnered worldwide interest within the AI community. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN utilizes spline-parametrized univariate functions in place of traditional linear weights, enabling them to dynamically learn activation patterns and significantly enhancing interpretability. In this paper, we explore the application of KAN to time series forecasting and propose two variants: T-KAN and MT-KAN. T-KAN is designed to detect concept drift within time series and can explain the nonlinear relationships between predictions and previous time steps through symbolic regression, making it highly interpretable in dynamically changing environments. MT-KAN, on the other hand, improves predictive performance by effectively uncovering and leveraging the complex relationships among variables in multivariate time series. Experiments validate the effectiveness of these approaches, demonstrating that T-KAN and MT-KAN significantly outperform traditional methods in time series forecasting tasks, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also improving model interpretability. This research opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, highlighting the potential of KAN as a powerful and interpretable tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02486v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing complex temporal patterns and relationships within multivariate data streams is a difficult task. We propose the Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (TKAT), a novel attention-based architecture designed to address this task using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). Inspired by the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), TKAT emerges as a powerful encoder-decoder model tailored to handle tasks in which the observed part of the features is more important than the a priori known part. This new architecture combined the theoretical foundation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with the power of transformers. TKAT aims to simplify the complex dependencies inherent in time series, making them more "interpretable". The use of transformer architecture in this framework allows us to capture long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Survival Analysis with Controlled Latent States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17077v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of learning individual-specific intensities of counting processes from a set of static variables and irregularly sampled time series. We introduce a novel modelization approach in which the intensity is the solution to a controlled differential equation. We first design a neural estimator by building on neural controlled differential equations. In a second time, we show that our model can be linearized in the signature space under sufficient regularity conditions, yielding a signature-based estimator which we call CoxSig. We provide theoretical learning guarantees for both estimators, before showcasing the performance of our models on a vast array of simulated and real-world datasets from finance, predictive maintenance and food supply chain management.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[A Practical Approach for Exploring Granger Connectivity in High-Dimensional Networks of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02360v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript presents a novel method for discovering effective connectivity between specified pairs of nodes in a high-dimensional network of time series. To accurately perform Granger causality analysis from the first node to the second node, it is essential to eliminate the influence of all other nodes within the network. The approach proposed is to create a low-dimensional representation of all other nodes in the network using frequency-domain-based dynamic principal component analysis (spectral DPCA). The resulting scores are subsequently removed from the first and second nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the high-dimensional network. To conduct hypothesis testing on Granger causality, we propose a permutation-based causality test. This test enhances the accuracy of our findings when the error structures are non-Gaussian. The approach has been validated in extensive simulation studies, which demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been demonstrated to be both expedient and viable on real datasets, with particular success observed on multichannel EEG networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15925v4)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identifiability of latent variable models has received increasing attention due to its relevance in interpretability and out-of-distribution generalisation. In this work, we study the identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems, taking an initial step toward extending identifiability analysis to sequential latent variable models. We first prove the identifiability of Markov Switching Models, which commonly serve as the prior distribution for the continuous latent variables in Switching Dynamical Systems. We present identification conditions for first-order Markov dependency structures, whose transition distribution is parametrised via non-linear Gaussians. We then establish the identifiability of the latent variables and non-linear mappings in Switching Dynamical Systems up to affine transformations, by leveraging identifiability analysis techniques from identifiable deep latent variable models. We finally develop estimation algorithms for identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems. Throughout empirical studies, we demonstrate the practicality of identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems for segmenting high-dimensional time series such as videos, and showcase the use of identifiable Markov Switching Models for regime-dependent causal discovery in climate data.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[A Survey of Transformer Enabled Time Series Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02322v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has received much attention in the image and language domains, with the transformer neural network continuing to dominate the state of the art. Application of these models to time series generation is less explored, however, and is of great utility to machine learning, privacy preservation, and explainability research. The present survey identifies this gap at the intersection of the transformer, generative AI, and time series data, and reviews works in this sparsely populated subdomain. The reviewed works show great variety in approach, and have not yet converged on a conclusive answer to the problems the domain poses. GANs, diffusion models, state space models, and autoencoders were all encountered alongside or surrounding the transformers which originally motivated the survey. While too open a domain to offer conclusive insights, the works surveyed are quite suggestive, and several recommendations for best practice, and suggestions of valuable future work, are provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional dynamic modelling for causal prediction in multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02320v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theoretical developments in sequential Bayesian analysis of multivariate dynamic models underlie new methodology for causal prediction. This extends the utility of existing models with computationally efficient methodology, enabling routine exploration of Bayesian counterfactual analyses with multiple selected time series as synthetic controls. Methodological contributions also define the concept of outcome adaptive modelling to monitor and inferentially respond to changes in experimental time series following interventions designed to explore causal effects. The benefits of sequential analyses with time-varying parameter models for causal investigations are inherited in this broader setting. A case study in commercial causal analysis-- involving retail revenue outcomes related to marketing interventions-- highlights the methodological advances.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |
| **[PeFAD: A Parameter-Efficient Federated Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02318v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of mobile sensing techniques, huge amounts of time series data are generated and accumulated in various domains, fueling plenty of real-world applications. In this setting, time series anomaly detection is practically important. It endeavors to identify deviant samples from the normal sample distribution in time series. Existing approaches generally assume that all the time series is available at a central location. However, we are witnessing the decentralized collection of time series due to the deployment of various edge devices. To bridge the gap between the decentralized time series data and the centralized anomaly detection algorithms, we propose a Parameter-efficient Federated Anomaly Detection framework named PeFAD with the increasing privacy concerns. PeFAD for the first time employs the pre-trained language model (PLM) as the body of the client's local model, which can benefit from its cross-modality knowledge transfer capability. To reduce the communication overhead and local model adaptation cost, we propose a parameter-efficient federated training module such that clients only need to fine-tune small-scale parameters and transmit them to the server for update. PeFAD utilizes a novel anomaly-driven mask selection strategy to mitigate the impact of neglected anomalies during training. A knowledge distillation operation on a synthetic privacy-preserving dataset that is shared by all the clients is also proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue across clients. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real datasets, where PeFAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines by up to 28.74\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2024 (Research Track)</p></details> |
| **[Generative Pre-Trained Diffusion Paradigm for Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02212v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, generative pre-trained paradigms such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) have achieved revolutionary advancements and widespread real-world applications. Particularly, the emergence of pre-trained LLMs-based temporal works, compared to previous deep model approaches, has demonstrated superior generalization and robustness, showcasing the potential of generative pre-trained paradigms as foundation models for time series. However, those LLMs-based works mainly focus on cross-modal research, i.e., leveraging the language capabilities of LLMs in time series contexts. Although they have achieved impressive performance, there still exist the issues of concept drift caused by differences in data distribution and inflexibility caused by misalignment of dimensions. To this end, inspired by recent work on LVMs, we reconsider the paradigm of time series modeling. In this paper, we comprehensively explore, for the first time, the effectiveness and superiority of the Generative Pre-trained Diffusion (GPD) paradigm in real-world multivariate time series forecasting (TSF). Specifically, to mitigate performance bias introduced by sophisticated networks, we propose a straightforward MLP diffusion network for unconditional modeling of time series. Then we employ a zero-shot and tuning-free method to predict (generate) future data using historical data as prompts. The GPD paradigm is established on the time series modality, effectively preventing the phenomenon of concept drift, and enabling flexible forecasting of arbitrary lengths. We demonstrate that the GPD paradigm achieves comprehensive performance and generalization comparable to current SOTA LLM-based and deep model paradigms on mainstream benchmarks and various TSF tasks. Extensive experiments validate the potential of the GPD paradigm and its assistance in future related research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02131v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM.

| **[Impacts of Climate Change on Mortality: An extrapolation of temperature effects based on time series data in France](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02054v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most contemporary mortality models rely on extrapolating trends or past events. However, population dynamics will be significantly impacted by climate change, notably the influence of temperatures on mortality. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to incorporate temperature effects on projected mortality using a multi-population mortality model. This method combines a stochastic mortality model with a climate epidemiology model, predicting mortality variations due to daily temperature fluctuations, be it excesses or insufficiencies. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to disrupt mortality projections by utilizing temperature forecasts from climate models and to assess the impact of this unaccounted risk factor in conventional mortality models. We illustrate this proposed mortality model using French data stratified by gender, focusing on past temperatures and mortality. Utilizing climate model predictions across various IPCC scenarios, we investigate gains and loss in life expectancy linked to temperatures and the additional mortality induced by extreme heatwaves, and quantify them by assessing this new risk factor in prediction intervals. Furthermore, we analyze the geographical differences across the Metropolitan France.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Common Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02001v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new notion $R_\ell$ of higher-order common information, which quantifies the information that $\ell\geq 2$ arbitrarily distributed random variables have in common. We provide analytical lower bounds on $R_3$ and $R_4$ for jointly Gaussian distributed sources and provide computable lower bounds for $R_\ell$ for any $\ell$ and any sources. We also provide a practical method to estimate the lower bounds on, e.g., real-world time-series data. As an example, we consider EEG data acquired in a setup with competing acoustic stimuli. We demonstrate that $R_3$ has descriptive properties that is not in $R_2$. Moreover, we observe a linear relationship between the amount of common information $R_3$ communicated from the acoustic stimuli and to the brain and the corresponding cortical activity in terms of neural tracking of the envelopes of the stimuli.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Convolutional Forecasting Network Based on Time Series Feature-Driven](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12038v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world scenarios contain a substantial amount of nonlinear information, which significantly interferes with the training process of models, leading to decreased prediction performance. Therefore, during the time series forecasting process, extracting the local and global time series patterns and understanding the potential nonlinear features among different time observations are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information at different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture potential nonlinear features among time observations. Building upon this, we propose ACNet, an adaptive convolutional network designed to effectively model the local and global temporal dependencies and the nonlinear features between observations in multivariate time series. Specifically, by extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, we capture both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed nonlinear feature adaptive extraction module captures the nonlinear features among different time observations in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ACNet across twelve real-world datasets. The results indicate that ACNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks with favorable runtime efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAFO: Feature-Centric Explanation on Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01833v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series (MTS) classification, finding the important features (e.g., sensors) for model performance is crucial yet challenging due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of MTS data, intricate temporal dynamics, and the necessity for domain-specific interpretations. Current explanation methods for MTS mostly focus on time-centric explanations, apt for pinpointing important time periods but less effective in identifying key features. This limitation underscores the pressing need for a feature-centric approach, a vital yet often overlooked perspective that complements time-centric analysis. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel feature-centric explanation and evaluation framework for MTS, named CAFO (Channel Attention and Feature Orthgonalization). CAFO employs a convolution-based approach with channel attention mechanisms, incorporating a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) and a QR decomposition-based loss for promoting feature-wise orthogonality. We demonstrate that this orthogonalization enhances the separability of attention distributions, thereby refining and stabilizing the ranking of feature importance. This improvement in feature-wise ranking enhances our understanding of feature explainability in MTS. Furthermore, we develop metrics to evaluate global and class-specific feature importance. Our framework's efficacy is validated through extensive empirical analyses on two major public benchmarks and real-world datasets, both synthetic and self-collected, specifically designed to highlight class-wise discriminative features. The results confirm CAFO's robustness and informative capacity in assessing feature importance in MTS classification tasks. This study not only advances the understanding of feature-centric explanations in MTS but also sets a foundation for future explorations in feature-centric explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD 2024 Research Track</p></details> |

A Python implementation is also presented. These have been presented and available in many books and texts but, I believe, a general compact and simple presentation is always welcome and not always simple to find. Since correlated observations are also included, these results may also be useful for time series analysis and spacial statistics. Other particular cases presented include regression, Gaussian processes and Bayesian Dynamic Models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, Python implementation</p></details> |
| **[Heracles: A Hybrid SSM-Transformer Model for High-Resolution Image and Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18063v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized image modeling tasks with adaptations like DeIT, Swin, SVT, Biformer, STVit, and FDVIT. However, these models often face challenges with inductive bias and high quadratic complexity, making them less efficient for high-resolution images. State space models (SSMs) such as Mamba, V-Mamba, ViM, and SiMBA offer an alternative to handle high resolution images in computer vision tasks. These SSMs encounter two major issues. First, they become unstable when scaled to large network sizes. Second, although they efficiently capture global information in images, they inherently struggle with handling local information. To address these challenges, we introduce Heracles, a novel SSM that integrates a local SSM, a global SSM, and an attention-based token interaction module. Heracles leverages a Hartely kernel-based state space model for global image information, a localized convolutional network for local details, and attention mechanisms in deeper layers for token interactions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Heracles-C-small achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset with 84.5\% top-1 accuracy. Heracles-C-Large and Heracles-C-Huge further improve accuracy to 85.9\% and 86.4\%, respectively. Additionally, Heracles excels in transfer learning tasks on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford Flowers, and Stanford Cars, and in instance segmentation on the MSCOCO dataset. Heracles also proves its versatility by achieving state-of-the-art results on seven time-series datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize across domains with spectral data, capturing both local and global information.

| **[Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs): Fast Pre-trained Models for Enhanced Zero/Few-Shot Forecasting of Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03955v6)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon. The source code for TTM can be accessed at https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/tree/main/tsfm_public/models/tinytimemixer.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of these models, likelihood-based inference for ARMA models has subtleties that have been previously identified but continue to cause difficulties in widely used data analysis strategies. We provide a summary of parameter estimation via maximum likelihood and discuss common pitfalls that may lead to sub-optimal parameter estimates. We propose a random initialization algorithm for parameter estimation that frequently yields higher likelihoods than traditional maximum likelihood estimation procedures. We then investigate the parameter uncertainty of maximum likelihood estimates, and propose the use of profile confidence intervals as a superior alternative to intervals derived from the Fisher's information matrix. Through a series of simulation studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and the improved nominal coverage of profile confidence intervals compared to the normal approximation based on Fisher's Information.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The developmental version of the R package used in this paper is available at the following GitHub repository: git@github.com:jeswheel/arima2.git</p></details> |

The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2307.04131</p></details> |
| **[Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal Downsampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10634v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a set of synchronous time series, each associated with a sensor-point in space and characterized by inter-series relationships, the problem of spatiotemporal forecasting consists of predicting future observations for each point. Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions, particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Identifiability of total effects from abstractions of time series causal graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14691v7)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of identifiability of the total effect of an intervention from observational time series in the situation, common in practice, where one only has access to abstractions of the true causal graph. We consider here two abstractions: the extended summary causal graph, which conflates all lagged causal relations but distinguishes between lagged and instantaneous relations, and the summary causal graph which does not give any indication about the lag between causal relations. We show that the total effect is always identifiable in extended summary causal graphs and provide sufficient conditions for identifiability in summary causal graphs. We furthermore provide adjustment sets allowing to estimate the total effect whenever it is identifiable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Structural Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01161v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a specific type of SCM, called a Dynamic Structural Causal Model (DSCM), whose endogenous variables represent functions of time, which is possibly cyclic and allows for latent confounding. As a motivating use-case, we show that certain systems of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) can be appropriately represented with DSCMs. An immediate consequence of this construction is a graphical Markov property for systems of SDEs. We define a time-splitting operation, allowing us to analyse the concept of local independence (a notion of continuous-time Granger (non-)causality). We also define a subsampling operation, which returns a discrete-time DSCM, and which can be used for mathematical analysis of subsampled time-series. We give suggestions how DSCMs can be used for identification of the causal effect of time-dependent interventions, and how existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms can be applied to time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMformer: Unlocking the Potential of Transformers in Time Series Forecasting with Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Channel-Wise Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10198v3)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures achieved breakthrough performance in natural language processing and computer vision, yet they remain inferior to simpler linear baselines in multivariate long-term forecasting. To better understand this phenomenon, we start by studying a toy linear forecasting problem for which we show that transformers are incapable of converging to their true solution despite their high expressive power. We further identify the attention of transformers as being responsible for this low generalization capacity. Building upon this insight, we propose a shallow lightweight transformer model that successfully escapes bad local minima when optimized with sharpness-aware optimization. We empirically demonstrate that this result extends to all commonly used real-world multivariate time series datasets.

At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than *1k* parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data. The code is publicly available at this repository: https://github.com/lss-1138/SparseTSF.</p></details> |  |

We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain, and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the reservoirs, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights using random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Stochastic Optimal Control for Diffusion Bridges in Function Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20630v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Schrödinger Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04795v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Our first step performs an eigenanalysis of a positive definite matrix, which leads to a one-to-one linear transformation for the original high-dimensional functional time series, and the transformed curve series can be segmented into several groups such that any two subseries from any two different groups are uncorrelated both contemporaneously and serially. Consequently in our second step those groups are handled separately without the information loss on the overall linear dynamic structure. The second step is devoted to establishing a finite-dimensional dynamical structure for all the transformed functional time series within each group. Furthermore the finite-dimensional structure is represented by that of a vector time series. Modelling and forecasting for the original high-dimensional functional time series are realized via those for the vector time series in all the groups. We investigate the theoretical properties of our proposed methods, and illustrate the finite-sample performance through both extensive simulation and two real datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.</p></details> |  |

Scientists focus on load forecasting but ignore other valuable electric-meters which should provide guidance of power system protection. We propose a new framework, multi-variable adversarial time-series forecasting model, which regularizes Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) models via an adversarial process. The novel model forecasts all variables (may in different type, such as continue variables, category variables, etc.) in power system at the same time and helps trade-off process between forecasting accuracy of single variable and variable-variable relations. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. The predict results of electricity consumption of industrial enterprises by multi-variable adversarial time-series forecasting model show that the proposed approach is able to achieve better prediction accuracy.

Most existing performance assessments of LLMs for spatial tasks have primarily focused on ChatGPT, whereas other chatbots received less attention. To narrow this research gap, this study conducts a zero-shot correctness evaluation for a set of 76 spatial tasks across seven task categories assigned to four prominent chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot. The chatbots generally performed well on tasks related to spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code writing, and spatial reasoning. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in correctness of results between the four chatbots.

Using the non-parametric flexibility of Gaussian processes, the recently proposed INTEL algorithm provides a product of experts approach to online prediction of time series under possible regime switching, including the special case of outliers. This is achieved by adaptively combining several candidate models, each reporting their predictive distribution at time $t$. However, the INTEL algorithm uses a finite context window approximation to the predictive distribution, the computation of which scales cubically with the maximum lag, or otherwise scales quartically with exact predictive distributions. We introduce LINTEL, which uses the exact filtering distribution at time $t$ with constant-time updates, making the time complexity of the streaming algorithm optimal. We additionally note that the weighting mechanism of INTEL is better suited to a mixture of experts approach, and propose a fusion policy based on arithmetic averaging for LINTEL. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is over five times faster than INTEL under reasonable settings with better quality predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[An Unsupervised Approach for Periodic Source Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00566v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection of periodic patterns of interest within noisy time series data plays a critical role in various tasks, spanning from health monitoring to behavior analysis. Existing learning techniques often rely on labels or clean versions of signals for detecting the periodicity, and those employing self-supervised learning methods are required to apply proper augmentations, which is already challenging for time series and can result in collapse -- all representations collapse to a single point due to strong augmentations. In this work, we propose a novel method to detect the periodicity in time series without the need for any labels or requiring tailored positive or negative data generation mechanisms with specific augmentations. We mitigate the collapse issue by ensuring the learned representations retain information from the original samples without imposing any random variance constraints on the batch. Our experiments in three time series tasks against state-of-the-art learning methods show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms prior works, achieving performance improvements of more than 45--50\%, showing its effectiveness.

Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.</p></details> |  |

It has been known for a long time that unit root tests may be flawed when a series although stationary has a root close to unity. That motivated recent papers dedicated to autoregressive processes where the bridge between stability and instability is expressed by means of time-varying coefficients. The process we consider has a companion matrix $A_{n}$ with spectral radius $\rho(A_{n}) < 1$ satisfying $\rho(A_{n}) \rightarrow 1$, a situation described as `nearly-unstable'. The question we investigate is: given an observed path supposed to come from a nearly-unstable process, is it possible to test for the `extent of instability', i.e. to test how close we are to the unit root? In this regard, we develop a strategy to evaluate $\alpha$ and to test for $\mathcal{H}_0 : ``\alpha = \alpha_0"$ against $\mathcal{H}_1 : ``\alpha > \alpha_0"$ when $\rho(A_{n})$ lies in an inner $O(n^{-\alpha})$-neighborhood of the unity, for some $0 < \alpha < 1$. Empirical evidence is given about the advantages of the flexibility induced by such a procedure compared to the common unit root tests. We also build a symmetric procedure for the usually left out situation where the dominant root lies around $-1$.</p></details> |  |

The industry often adopts the method involving multi-view stereo and non-rigid alignment. However, this approach is prone to errors and heavily reliant on time-consuming manual processing by artists. To simplify this process, we propose Topo4D, a novel framework for automatic geometry and texture generation, which optimizes densely aligned 4D heads and 8K texture maps directly from calibrated multi-view time-series images. Specifically, we first represent the time-series faces as a set of dynamic 3D Gaussians with fixed topology in which the Gaussian centers are bound to the mesh vertices. Afterward, we perform alternative geometry and texture optimization frame-by-frame for high-quality geometry and texture learning while maintaining temporal topology stability. Finally, we can extract dynamic facial meshes in regular wiring arrangement and high-fidelity textures with pore-level details from the learned Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than the current SOTA face reconstruction methods both in the quality of meshes and textures.

However, most of the proposed models are designed based on the designers' inherent knowledge and experience without elaborating on the suitability of the proposed neural architectures. Moreover, these models cannot be self-adjusted to dynamically changed data patterns due to the inflexible design of their structures. Although several recent studies have considered the application of the neural architecture search (NAS) technique for obtaining a network with an optimized structure in the electricity forecasting sector, their training process is computationally expensive and their search strategies are not flexible, indicating that the NAS application in this area is still at an infancy stage. In this study, we propose an intelligent automated architecture search (IAAS) framework for the development of time-series electricity forecasting models. The proposed framework contains three primary components, i.e., network function-preserving transformation operation, reinforcement learning (RL)-based network transformation control, and heuristic network screening, which aim to improve the search quality of a network structure. After conducting comprehensive experiments on two publicly-available electricity load datasets and two wind power datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed IAAS framework significantly outperforms the ten existing models or methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and stability. Finally, we perform an ablation experiment to showcase the importance of critical components in the proposed IAAS framework in improving forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at INFORMS Journal on Computing</p></details> |

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a prediction model based on Random Forest for the turning point of the antagonistic event-group. Firstly, the quantitative equation of competitive potential energy is proposed; Secondly, the quantitative value of competitive potential energy is obtained by using the dynamic combination of weights method, and the turning point of the competition situation of the antagonistic event-group is marked according to the quantitative time series graph; Finally, the random forest prediction model based on the optimisation of the KM-SMOTE algorithm and the grid search method is established. The experimental analysis shows that: The quantitative equation of competitive potential energy can effectively reflect the dynamic situation of the competition; The model can effectively predict the turning point of the competition situation of the antagonistic event-group, and the recall rate of the model in the test set is 86.13%; The model has certain significance for the future study of the competition situation of the antagonistic event-group.</p></details> |  |

Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Process-based hydrological models (aka physics-based models) are based on physical laws, but using simplifying assumptions which can lead to poor accuracy. Data-driven approaches offer a powerful alternative, but they require large amount of training data and tend to produce predictions that are inconsistent with physical laws. This paper studies a constrained reasoning and learning (CRL) approach where physical laws represented as logical constraints are integrated as a layer in the deep neural network. To address small data setting, we develop a theoretically-grounded training approach to improve the generalization accuracy of deep models. For uncertainty quantification, we combine the synergistic strengths of Gaussian processes (GPs) and deep temporal models (i.e., deep models for time-series forecasting) by passing the learned latent representation as input to a standard distance-based kernel. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both CRL and GP with deep kernel approaches over strong baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Our model decomposes such data into two distinct components: a low-dimensional predictable factor component and an unpredictable error term. These components are identified through the autocovariance structure of the underlying functional time series. The model parameters are consistently estimated using the eigencomponents of a cumulative autocovariance operator and an information criterion is proposed to determine the appropriate number of factors. The methodology is applied to yield curve modeling and forecasting. Our results indicate that more than three factors are required to characterize the dynamics of the term structure of bond yields.</p></details> |  |

Recent deep learning models for multivariate time series have developed efficient parameterizations for time-varying contemporaneous covariance, but they often assume temporal independence of errors for simplicity. However, real-world data frequently exhibit significant error autocorrelation and cross-lag correlation due to factors such as missing covariates. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play method that learns the covariance structure of errors over multiple steps for autoregressive models with Gaussian-distributed errors. To achieve scalable inference and computational efficiency, we model the contemporaneous covariance using a low-rank-plus-diagonal parameterization and characterize cross-covariance through a group of independent latent temporal processes. The learned covariance matrix can be used to calibrate predictions based on observed residuals. We evaluate our method on probabilistic models built on RNN and Transformer architectures, and the results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification without significantly increasing the parameter size.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper extends the work presented in arXiv:2305.17028 to a multivariate setting</p></details> |

As a result, it is customary to fall back on simulators when creating benchmark tasks. Simulators offer great control but are often too simplistic to make challenging tasks, either because they are hand-designed and lack the nuances of real-world data, or because they are fit to observational data without structural constraints. In this work, we propose a general, repeatable strategy for turning observational data into sequential structural causal models and challenging estimation tasks by following two simple principles: 1) fitting real-world data where possible, and 2) creating complexity by composing simple, hand-designed mechanisms. We implement these ideas in a highly configurable software package and apply it to the well-known Adult income data set to construct the \tt IncomeSCM simulator. From this, we devise multiple estimation tasks and sample data sets to compare established estimators of causal effects. The tasks present a suitable challenge, with effect estimates varying greatly in quality between methods, despite similar performance in the modeling of factual outcomes, highlighting the need for dedicated causal estimators and model selection criteria.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rough Transformers: Lightweight Continuous-Time Sequence Modelling with Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20799v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose \textit{multi-view signature attention}, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Confidential Forecasting with Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20761v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in industrial applications, such as predictive maintenance and machine control. Critical challenges to address in manufacturing include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, to increase industry adaptability, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address those challenges and propose 'Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL' (STV), a novel framework that exhibits the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically partitioned data; ii) serverless forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for direct parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal hyperparameter tuning complexity. We conduct evaluations on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Our results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. They also show that our direct optimization can outperform centralized methods, which include state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also conduct a scalability analysis by examining the communication costs of direct and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two.

| **[Class-Based Time Series Data Augmentation to Mitigate Extreme Class Imbalance for Solar Flare Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20590v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data plays a crucial role across various domains, making it valuable for decision-making and predictive modeling. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown promise in this regard, yet their performance hinges on data quality and quantity, often constrained by data scarcity and class imbalance, particularly for rare events like solar flares. Data augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges, yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF, using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC. The results demonstrate the efficacy of MGN and highlight its potential for improving classification performance in scenarios with extremely imbalanced data. Our time complexity analysis shows that MGN also has a competitive computational cost compared to the investigated alternative methods.</p></details> |  |

We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We propose a graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that GFSA improves the performance of Transformers in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph regression, speech recognition, and code classification.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Robust Explainer Recommendation for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05501v4)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is a task which deals with temporal sequences, a prevalent data type common in domains such as human activity recognition, sports analytics and general sensing. In this area, interest in explainability has been growing as explanation is key to understand the data and the model better. Recently, a great variety of techniques have been proposed and adapted for time series to provide explanation in the form of saliency maps, where the importance of each data point in the time series is quantified with a numerical value. However, the saliency maps can and often disagree, so it is unclear which one to use. This paper provides a novel framework to quantitatively evaluate and rank explanation methods for time series classification. We show how to robustly evaluate the informativeness of a given explanation method (i.e., relevance for the classification task), and how to compare explanations side-by-side. The goal is to recommend the best explainer for a given time series classification dataset. We propose AMEE, a Model-Agnostic Explanation Evaluation framework, for recommending saliency-based explanations for time series classification. In this approach, data perturbation is added to the input time series guided by each explanation. Our results show that perturbing discriminative parts of the time series leads to significant changes in classification accuracy, which can be used to evaluate each explanation. To be robust to different types of perturbations and different types of classifiers, we aggregate the accuracy loss across perturbations and classifiers. This novel approach allows us to recommend the best explainer among a set of different explainers, including random and oracle explainers. We provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis for synthetic datasets, a variety of timeseries datasets, as well as a real-world case study with known expert ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</p></details> |

Forecasts using a Poisson-Lindley integer autoregressive (PLINAR) model are compared to variations of Gaussian forecasts via simulation by equating relevant moments of the marginals of the PLINAR to the Gaussian AR. To illustrate utility, the methods discussed are applied and compared using a discrete series with model parameters being estimated using each of conditional least squares, Yule-Walker, and maximum likelihood.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Networks for Extreme Quantile Regression with an Application to Forecasting of Flood Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07590v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk assessment for extreme events requires accurate estimation of high quantiles that go beyond the range of historical observations. When the risk depends on the values of observed predictors, regression techniques are used to interpolate in the predictor space. We propose the EQRN model that combines tools from neural networks and extreme value theory into a method capable of extrapolation in the presence of complex predictor dependence. Neural networks can naturally incorporate additional structure in the data. We develop a recurrent version of EQRN that is able to capture complex sequential dependence in time series. We apply this method to forecast flood risk in the Swiss Aare catchment. It exploits information from multiple covariates in space and time to provide one-day-ahead predictions of return levels and exceedance probabilities. This output complements the static return level from a traditional extreme value analysis, and the predictions are able to adapt to distributional shifts as experienced in a changing climate. Our model can help authorities to manage flooding more effectively and to minimize their disastrous impacts through early warning systems.</p></details> |  |

We consider a joint network model in which each node has an associated time-varying low-dimensional latent vector of feature data, and connection probabilities are functions of these vectors. Under mild assumptions, the time-varying evolution of the latent vectors exhibits low-dimensional manifold structure under a suitable notion of distance. This distance can be approximated by a measure of separation between the observed networks themselves, and there exist Euclidean representations for underlying network structure, as characterized by this distance, at any given time. These Euclidean representations, called Euclidean mirrors, permit the visualization of network evolution and transform network inference questions such as change-point and anomaly detection into a classical setting. We illustrate our methodology with real and synthetic data, and identify change points corresponding to massive shifts in pandemic policies in a communication network of a large organization.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 26 pages of supplementary material and proofs, 12 figures</p></details> |

Leveraging remote sensed data from satellite networks and advanced AI models to automatically detect hotspots (i.e., thermal anomalies caused by active fires) is an effective way to build wildfire monitoring systems. In this work, we propose a novel dataset containing time series of remotely sensed data related to European fire events and a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-based model able to analyse multi-temporal data and identify hotspots in potentially near real time. We train and evaluate the performance of our model using our dataset and Thraws, a dataset of thermal anomalies including several fire events, obtaining an F1 score of 63.58.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous identification of models and parameters of scientific simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15174v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many scientific models are composed of multiple discrete components, and scientists often make heuristic decisions about which components to include. Bayesian inference provides a mathematical framework for systematically selecting model components, but defining prior distributions over model components and developing associated inference schemes has been challenging. We approach this problem in a simulation-based inference framework: We define model priors over candidate components and, from model simulations, train neural networks to infer joint probability distributions over both model components and associated parameters. Our method, simulation-based model inference (SBMI), represents distributions over model components as a conditional mixture of multivariate binary distributions in the Grassmann formalism. SBMI can be applied to any compositional stochastic simulator without requiring likelihood evaluations. We evaluate SBMI on a simple time series model and on two scientific models from neuroscience, and show that it can discover multiple data-consistent model configurations, and that it reveals non-identifiable model components and parameters. SBMI provides a powerful tool for data-driven scientific inquiry which will allow scientists to identify essential model components and make uncertainty-informed modelling decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch: A Simple Mechanism for Improving Time-Series Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20082v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches for learning representations of time-series keep the temporal arrangement of the time-steps intact with the presumption that the original order is the most optimal for learning. However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play mechanism called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve time-series representation learning of existing models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is the most optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to create various degrees of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification and forecasting, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline.

Thus, the demand for multimodal machine learning models has sharply risen for modalities that go beyond vision and language, such as sequences, graphs, time series, or tabular data. While there are many available multimodal fusion and alignment approaches, most of them require end-to-end training, scale quadratically with the number of modalities, cannot handle cases of high modality imbalance in the training set, or are highly topology-specific, making them too restrictive for many biomedical learning tasks. This paper presents Multimodal Lego (MM-Lego), a modular and general-purpose fusion and model merging framework to turn any set of encoders into a competitive multimodal model with no or minimal fine-tuning. We achieve this by introducing a wrapper for unimodal encoders that enforces lightweight dimensionality assumptions between modalities and harmonises their representations by learning features in the frequency domain to enable model merging with little signal interference. We show that MM-Lego 1) can be used as a model merging method which achieves competitive performance with end-to-end fusion models without any fine-tuning, 2) can operate on any unimodal encoder, and 3) is a model fusion method that, with minimal fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarked multimodal biomedical tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a unique neural network architecture comprised of Radial Basis Function (RBF) layers combined with an attention mechanism designed to effectively capture nonlinear inter-dependencies inherent in the attractor's temporal evolution. Our results demonstrate successful prediction of the attractor's trajectory across 100 predictions made using a real-world dataset of 36,700 time-series observations encompassing approximately 28 minutes of activity. To further illustrate the performance of our proposed technique, we provide comprehensive visualizations depicting the attractor's original and predicted behaviors alongside quantitative measures comparing observed versus estimated outcomes. Overall, this work showcases the potential of advanced machine learning algorithms in elucidating hidden structures in complex physical systems while offering practical applications in various domains requiring accurate short-term forecasting capabilities.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

However, the ability of TSAD is limited by two key challenges: (i) the ability to model long-range dependency and (ii) the generalization issue in the presence of non-stationary data. To tackle these challenges, an anomaly detector that leverages the selective state space model known for its proficiency in capturing long-term dependencies across various domains is proposed. Additionally, a multi-stage detrending mechanism is introduced to mitigate the prominent trend component in non-stationary data to address the generalization issue. Extensive experiments conducted on realworld public datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods surpass all 12 compared baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters</p></details> |

In this paper we propose a dimensionality reduction and shape recognition approach based on the SAX algorithm, an application which requires responses on cost efficient, IoT-like, platforms. The challenge is largely dealing with the computational expense of the SAX algorithm in IoT-like applications, from simple time-series dimension reduction through shape recognition. The approach is based on lowering the dimensional space while capturing and preserving the most representative features of the shape.

The pseudo maximum likelihood setting under a large cross-sectional dimension n and a fixed time series dimension T relies on a diagonal TxT covariance matrix of the errors without imposing sphericity nor Gaussianity. We outline the asymptotic distributions of the latent factor and error covariance estimates as well as of an asymptotically uniformly most powerful invariant (AUMPI) test for the number of factors based on the likelihood ratio statistic. We derive the AUMPI characterization from inequalities ensuring the monotone likelihood ratio property for positive definite quadratic forms in normal variables. An empirical application to a large panel of monthly U.S. stock returns separates month after month systematic and idiosyncratic risks in short subperiods of bear vs. bull market based on the selected number of factors. We observe an uptrend in the paths of total and idiosyncratic volatilities while the systematic risk explains a large part of the cross-sectional total variance in bear markets but is not driven by a single factor. Rank tests show that observed factors struggle spanning latent factors with a discrepancy between the dimensions of the two factor spaces decreasing over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Change Point Estimation for High Dimensional Time Series by Sparse Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10656v2)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series may be subject to partial structural changes over certain frequency band, for instance, in neuroscience. We study the change point detection problem with high dimensional time series, within the framework of frequency domain. The overarching goal is to locate all change points and delineate which series are activated by the change, over which frequencies. In practice, the number of activated series per change and frequency could span from a few to full participation. We solve the problem by first computing a CUSUM tensor based on spectra estimated from blocks of the time series. A frequency-specific projection approach is applied for dimension reduction. The projection direction is estimated by a proposed tensor decomposition algorithm that adjusts to the sparsity level of changes. Finally, the projected CUSUM vectors across frequencies are aggregated for change point detection. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of estimated change points and the convergence rate of their locations. We derive error bounds for the estimated projection direction for identifying the frequency-specific series activated in a change. We provide data-driven rules for the choice of parameters. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation and a stock returns application.</p></details> |  |

Many existing feature selection methods fall short in effectively leveraging time-series information, primarily because they are designed for static data. Our approach addresses this limitation by enabling the selection of time-varying feature subsets for each patient. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning to optimize a policy under maximum cost restrictions. The prediction model is subsequently updated using synthetic data generated by trained policy. Our method can seamlessly integrate with non-differentiable prediction models. We conducted experiments on a sizable clinical dataset encompassing regression and classification tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong feature selection baselines, particularly when subjected to stringent cost limitations.

This paper introduces a signal-noise separation method based on time series prediction. We use Reservoir Computing (RC) to extract the maximum portion of "predictable information" from a given signal. Reproducing the deterministic component of the signal using RC, we estimate the noise distribution from the difference between the original signal and reconstructed one. The method is based on a machine learning approach and requires no prior knowledge of either the deterministic signal or the noise distribution. It provides a way to identify additivity/multiplicativity of noise and to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indirectly. The method works successfully for combinations of various signal and noise, including chaotic signal and highly oscillating sinusoidal signal which are corrupted by non-Gaussian additive/ multiplicative noise. The separation performances are robust and notably outstanding for signals with strong noise, even for those with negative SNR.</p></details> |  |

This has also brought great challenges in handling heterogeneous, multi-resolution data which arise ubiquitously in mobile health due to irregular multivariate measurements collected from individuals. In this paper, we propose an individualized dynamic latent factor model for irregular multi-resolution time series data to interpolate unsampled measurements of time series with low resolution. One major advantage of the proposed method is the capability to integrate multiple irregular time series and multiple subjects by mapping the multi-resolution data to the latent space. In addition, the proposed individualized dynamic latent factor model is applicable to capturing heterogeneous longitudinal information through individualized dynamic latent factors. Our theory provides a bound on the integrated interpolation error and the convergence rate for B-spline approximation methods. Both the simulation studies and the application to smartwatch data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |

Unfortunately, the majority of current time series prediction models fail to simultaneously learn the correlations of multivariate time series at multi-grained levels, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Multi-Grained Correlations-based Prediction (MGCP) Network, which simultaneously considers the correlations at three granularity levels to enhance prediction performance. Specifically, MGCP utilizes Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators and Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the global spatiotemporal correlations and inter-series correlations, enabling the extraction of potential features from multivariate time series at fine-grained and medium-grained levels. Additionally, MGCP employs adversarial training with an attention mechanism-based predictor and conditional discriminator to optimize prediction results at coarse-grained level, ensuring high fidelity between the generated forecast results and the actual data distribution. Finally, we compare MGCP with several state-of-the-art time series prediction algorithms on real-world benchmark datasets, and our results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |

However, an analysis reveals certain unfaithfulness issues, including high sensitivity to random seeds and minute input noise perturbations. Recognizing these challenges, we embark on a quest to define the concept of \textbf{\underline{F}aithful \underline{T}ime\underline{S}ieve \underline{(FTS)}}, a model that consistently delivers reliable and robust predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed at identifying and rectifying unfaithfulness in TimeSieve. Our framework is designed to enhance the model's stability and resilience, ensuring that its outputs are less susceptible to the aforementioned factors. Experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating improved faithfulness in the model's behavior. Looking forward, we plan to expand our experimental scope to further validate and optimize our algorithm, ensuring comprehensive faithfulness across a wide range of scenarios. Ultimately, we aspire to make this framework can be applied to enhance the faithfulness of not just TimeSieve but also other state-of-the-art temporal methods, thereby contributing to the reliability and robustness of temporal modeling as a whole.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point process analysis of geographical diffusion of news in Argentina](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19552v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion of information plays a crucial role in a society, characterizing the diffusion process is challenging because it is highly non-stationary and varies with the media type. To understand the spreading of newspaper news in Argentina, we collected data from more than 27000 articles published in six main provinces during four months. We classified the articles into 20 thematic axes and obtained a set of 120 time series that capture daily newspaper attention on different topics in different provinces. To analyze the data we use a point process approach. For each topic, $n$, and for all pairs of provinces, $i$ and $j$, we use two measures to quantify the synchronicity of the events, $Q_s(i,j)$, which quantifies the number of events that occur almost simultaneously in $i$ and $j$, and $Q_a(i,j)$, which quantifies the direction of news spreading. We also analyze the dataset using well-known measures to detect correlations and dependencies, computed from the raw time series: undirected measures (linear cross-correlation, $CC$, and nonlinear mutual information, $MI$) and directed measures (linear Granger causality, $GC$, and nonlinear Transfer entropy, $TE$). Our analysis unveils how fast the information diffusion process is, as high values of $Q_{s}$, $CC$, and $MI$ reveal pairs of provinces with very similar and almost simultaneous temporal variations of media attention. On the other hand, $GC$ and $TE$ do not perform well in this context because they often return opposite directions of information transfer. We interpret this as due to three main factors: the characteristics of the data, which is highly non-stationary, the characteristics of the information diffusion process, which is very fast and probably acts at a sub-resolution time scale, and the action of large media companies that act as global, external drivers of information dissemination.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNITS: A Unified Multi-Task Time Series Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00131v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in time series models are driving a shift from conventional deep learning methods to pre-trained foundational models. While pre-trained transformers and reprogrammed text-based LLMs report state-of-the-art results, the best-performing architectures vary significantly across tasks, and models often have limited scope, such as focusing only on time series forecasting. Models that unify predictive and generative time series tasks under a single framework remain challenging to achieve. We introduce UniTS, a multi-task time series model that uses task tokenization to express predictive and generative tasks within a single model. UniTS leverages a modified transformer block designed to obtain universal time series representations. This design induces transferability from a heterogeneous, multi-domain pre-training dataset-often with diverse dynamic patterns, sampling rates, and temporal scales-to many downstream datasets, which can also be diverse in task specifications and data domains. Across 38 datasets spanning human activity sensors, healthcare, engineering, and finance domains, UniTS model performs favorably against 12 forecasting models, 20 classification models, 18 anomaly detection models, and 16 imputation models, including repurposed text-based LLMs. UniTS demonstrates effective few-shot and prompt learning capabilities when evaluated on new data domains and tasks. In the conventional single-task setting, UniTS outperforms strong task-specialized time series models.

This methodology can be adapted to stationary time series, yet inferring causal relationships from nonstationary time series remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a new class of restricted SCM, via a time-varying filter and stationary noise, and exploit the asymmetry from nonstationarity for causal identification in both bivariate and network settings. We propose efficient procedures by leveraging powerful estimates of the bivariate evolutionary spectra for slowly varying processes. Various synthetic and real datasets that involve high-order and non-smooth filters are evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was intended as a replacement of arXiv:2012.13025 and any subsequent updates will appear there</p></details> |
| **[Efficient and Effective Time-Series Forecasting with Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01533v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of biological neurons, provide a unique pathway for capturing the intricacies of temporal data. However, applying SNNs to time-series forecasting is challenging due to difficulties in effective temporal alignment, complexities in encoding processes, and the absence of standardized guidelines for model selection. In this paper, we propose a framework for SNNs in time-series forecasting tasks, leveraging the efficiency of spiking neurons in processing temporal information. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed SNN-based approaches achieve comparable or superior results to traditional time-series forecasting methods on diverse benchmarks with much less energy consumption. Furthermore, we conduct detailed analysis experiments to assess the SNN's capacity to capture temporal dependencies within time-series data, offering valuable insights into its nuanced strengths and effectiveness in modeling the intricate dynamics of temporal data. Our study contributes to the expanding field of SNNs and offers a promising alternative for time-series forecasting tasks, presenting a pathway for the development of more biologically inspired and temporally aware forecasting models.

Such information is invaluable for monitoring large urban areas and supporting the implementation of decision-making services. When analyzed in real time, NSD can enable the early detection of critical urban events, including fires, large accidents, stampedes, terrorist attacks, and sports and leisure gatherings, especially if these events significantly impact mobile phone network activity in the affected areas. This paper presents empirical evidence that advanced NSD can detect anomalies in mobile traffic service consumption, attributable to critical urban events, with fine spatial and temporal resolutions. We introduce two methodologies for real-time anomaly detection from multivariate time series extracted from large-scale NSD, utilizing a range of algorithms adapted from the state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. Our research includes a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of these algorithms on a large-scale dataset of NSD service consumption for the Paris region. The evaluation uses an original dataset of documented critical or unusual urban events. This dataset has been built as a ground truth basis for assessing the algorithms performance. The obtained results demonstrate that our framework can detect unusual events almost instantaneously and locate the affected areas with high precision, largely outperforming random classifiers. This efficiency and effectiveness underline the potential of NSD-based anomaly detection in significantly enhancing emergency response strategies and urban planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to PLOS ONE journal</p></details> |
| **[Machine Learning in Short-Reach Optical Systems: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09557v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to explore the utilization of machine learning algorithms in various direct-detected and self-coherent short-reach communication applications. These applications encompass a wide range of tasks, including bandwidth request prediction, signal quality monitoring, fault detection, traffic prediction, and digital signal processing (DSP)-based equalization. As a versatile approach, machine learning demonstrates the ability to address stochastic phenomena in optical systems networks where deterministic methods may fall short. However, when it comes to DSP equalization algorithms, their performance improvements are often marginal, and their complexity is prohibitively high, especially in cost-sensitive short-reach communications scenarios such as passive optical networks (PONs). They excel in capturing temporal dependencies, handling irregular or nonlinear patterns effectively, and accommodating variable time intervals. Within this extensive survey, we outline the application of machine learning techniques in short-reach communications, specifically emphasizing their utilization in high-bandwidth demanding PONs. Notably, we introduce a novel taxonomy for time-series methods employed in machine learning signal processing, providing a structured classification framework. Our taxonomy categorizes current time series methods into four distinct groups: traditional methods, Fourier convolution-based methods, transformer-based models, and time-series convolutional networks. Finally, we highlight prospective research directions within this rapidly evolving field and outline specific solutions to mitigate the complexity associated with hardware implementations. We aim to pave the way for more practical and efficient deployment of machine learning approaches in short-reach optical communication systems by addressing complexity concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 figure, 3 tables, Accepted as MDPI Photonics Journal Speical Issue Machine Learning Applied to Optical Communication Systems</p></details> |

Despite advances in remote sensing data for urban monitoring, coarse-grained classification systems and the lack of continuous temporal observations hinder the application of deep learning to urban change analysis. To address this, we introduce FUSU, a multi-source, multi-temporal change segmentation dataset for fine-grained urban semantic understanding. FUSU features the most detailed land use classification system to date, with 17 classes and 30 billion pixels of annotations. It includes bi-temporal high-resolution satellite images with 20-50 cm ground sample distance and monthly optical and radar satellite time series, covering 847 km2 across five urban areas in China. The fine-grained pixel-wise annotations and high spatial-temporal resolution data provide a robust foundation for deep learning models to understand urbanization and land use changes. To fully leverage FUSU, we propose a unified time-series architecture for both change detection and segmentation and benchmark FUSU on various methods for several tasks. Dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/yuanshuai0914/FUSU.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterpretCC: Intrinsic User-Centric Interpretability through Global Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02933v3)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability for neural networks is a trade-off between three key requirements: 1) faithfulness of the explanation (i.e., how perfectly it explains the prediction), 2) understandability of the explanation by humans, and 3) model performance. Most existing methods compromise one or more of these requirements; e.g., post-hoc approaches provide limited faithfulness, automatically identified feature masks compromise understandability, and intrinsically interpretable methods such as decision trees limit model performance. These shortcomings are unacceptable for sensitive applications such as education and healthcare, which require trustworthy explanations, actionable interpretations, and accurate predictions. In this work, we present InterpretCC (interpretable conditional computation), a family of interpretable-by-design neural networks that guarantee human-centric interpretability, while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art models by adaptively and sparsely activating features before prediction. We extend this idea into an interpretable, global mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that allows humans to specify topics of interest, discretely separates the feature space for each data point into topical subnetworks, and adaptively and sparsely activates these topical subnetworks for prediction. We apply variations of the InterpretCC architecture for text, time series and tabular data across several real-world benchmarks, demonstrating comparable performance with non-interpretable baselines, outperforming interpretable-by-design baselines, and showing higher actionability and usefulness according to a user study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18975v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly advanced time series forecasting through its powerful capacity to capture sequence relationships. However, training these models with the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss often results in over-smooth predictions, making it challenging to handle the complexity and learn high-entropy features from time series data with high variability and unpredictability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing time series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while considering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic component that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a Hierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy features at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label for timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier mitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also implement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency across hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines on several real-world datasets. Code is available at:https://github.com/syrGitHub/HCAN.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, inaccuracy in detecting an event can often result from its preceding or delayed effects reflected in neighboring detections. These detections are valuable to trigger necessary actions or help mitigate unwelcome consequences. In this context, current metrics are insufficient and inadequate for the context of event detection. There is a demand for metrics that incorporate both the concept of time and temporal tolerance for neighboring detections. This paper introduces SoftED metrics, a new set of metrics designed for soft evaluating event detection methods. They enable the evaluation of both detection accuracy and the degree to which their detections represent events. They improved event detection evaluation by associating events and their representative detections, incorporating temporal tolerance in over 36\% of experiments compared to the usual classification metrics. SoftED metrics were validated by domain specialists that indicated their contribution to detection evaluation and method selection.</p></details> | 19 pages |

In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2024)</p></details> |

Automatically modeling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal labels for an existing dataset of children's stories originally annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the categorical labels to the continuous valence and arousal space. For predicting the thus obtained emotionality signals, we fine-tune a DeBERTa model and improve upon this baseline via a weakly supervised learning approach. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of $.8221$ for valence and $.7125$ for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach. A detailed analysis shows the extent to which the results vary depending on factors such as the author, the individual story, or the section within the story. In addition, we uncover the weaknesses of our approach by investigating examples that prove to be difficult to predict.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.11382</p></details> |

The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In this work, we investigate cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by jointly designing three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and user scheduling. Considering the UAV's onboard energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated in which the average achievable rate of the considered system is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory, transmission power, and user scheduling. Due to the non-convex optimization problem, a lower bound on the average achievable rate is utilized to reduce the complexity of the solution. Subsequently, the original optimization problem is decoupled into four subproblems by using block coordinate descent, and each subproblem is transformed into manageable convex optimization problems by introducing slack variables and successive convex approximation. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the 3D trajectories of UAVs can enhance the average achievable rate of aerial CRNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures,submitted to the IEEE journal for review</p></details> |

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

However, diffusion models with neural networks inevitably make prediction errors, which leads to constraint violations such as unmet goals or collisions. This paper presents a novel constraint-aware diffusion model for trajectory optimization. We introduce a novel hybrid loss function for training that minimizes the constraint violation of diffusion samples compared to the groundtruth while recovering the original data distribution. Our model is demonstrated on tabletop manipulation and two-car reach-avoid problems, outperforming traditional diffusion models in minimizing constraint violations while generating samples close to locally optimal solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCF: Cross Correcting Framework for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00749v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting future pedestrian trajectories is crucial across various domains. Due to the uncertainty in future pedestrian trajectories, it is important to learn complex spatio-temporal representations in multi-agent scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Correction Framework (CCF) to learn spatio-temporal representations of pedestrian trajectories better. Our framework consists of two trajectory prediction models, known as subnets, which share the same architecture and are trained with both cross-correction loss and trajectory prediction loss. Cross-correction leverages the learning from both subnets and enables them to refine their underlying representations of trajectories through a mutual correction mechanism. Specifically, we use the cross-correction loss to learn how to correct each other through an inter-subnet interaction. To induce diverse learning among the subnets, we use the transformed observed trajectories produced by a neural network as input to one subnet and the original observed trajectories as input to the other subnet. We utilize transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for each subnet to capture motion and social interaction among pedestrians. The encoder of the transformer captures motion patterns in trajectories, while the decoder focuses on pedestrian interactions with neighbors. Each subnet performs the primary task of predicting future trajectories (a regression task) along with the secondary task of classifying the predicted trajectories (a classification task). Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and SDD demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, CCF, in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. We also conducted several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various modules and loss functions used in our approach.</p></details> | Under review |

While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

To date, extensive works have focused on the design, modeling, and control of bi-copters. Besides, a proper motion planner utilizing bi-copters' shape characteristics is essential to efficiently and safely traverse tight spaces, yet it has rarely been studied. Current motion planning methods will significantly compromise their ability to traverse narrow spaces if the map is inflated based on the long dimension of the bi-copter. In this paper, we propose an efficient motion planning method that enables the safe navigation of bi-copters through narrow spaces. We first adapt a dynamic, feasible path-finding algorithm with whole-body collision checks to generate a collision-free path. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the position and rotation of the bi-copter to produce a trajectory that is safe, dynamically feasible, and smooth. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have been conducted to verify the reliability and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |

Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Stabilize Unknown LTI Systems on a Single Trajectory under Stochastic Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00234v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.</p></details> |  |

| **[CSDO: Enhancing Efficiency and Success in Large-Scale Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20858v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an efficient algorithm, naming Centralized Searching and Decentralized Optimization (CSDO), to find feasible solution for large-scale Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning (MVTP) problem. Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second. Source codes are released in https://github.com/YangSVM/CSDOTrajectoryPlanning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Structure-Aware Lane Graph Transformer Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20121v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories for surrounding vehicles is vital for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes a Lane Graph Transformer (LGT) model with structure-aware capabilities. Its key contribution lies in encoding the map topology structure into the attention mechanism. To address variations in lane information from different directions, four Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) matrices are introduced to capture the local details of the map topology structure. Additionally, two Shortest Path Distance (SPD) matrices are employed to capture distance information between two accessible lanes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed LGT model achieves a significantly higher prediction performance on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Specifically, the minFDE$_6$ metric was decreased by 60.73% compared to the Argoverse 2 baseline model (Nearest Neighbor) and the b-minFDE$_6$ metric was reduced by 2.65% compared to the baseline LaneGCN model. Furthermore, ablation experiments demonstrated that the consideration of map topology structure led to a 4.24% drop in the b-minFDE$_6$ metric, validating the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Human Mobility: Inferring Semantics of Trajectories with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19850v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human mobility patterns is essential for various applications, from urban planning to public safety. The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns. This study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing the semantic analysis of trajectory data, paving the way for more sophisticated and accessible human mobility research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on three real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Trajectory Inference in Wasserstein Space Using Consecutive Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19679v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing data from dynamic processes through cross-sectional measurements is seen in many fields such as computational biology. Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is instrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We rigorously evaluate our method by providing convergence guarantees and testing it on simulated cell data characterized by bifurcations and merges, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories, but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> |  |

Projecting Autonomous System Trajectories Into Naturalistic Behavior Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19292v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents operating around human actors must consider how their behaviors might affect those humans, even when not directly interacting with them. To this end, it is often beneficial to be predictable and appear naturalistic. Existing methods to address this problem use human actor intent modeling or imitation learning techniques, but these approaches rarely capture all possible motivations for human behavior or require significant amounts of data. In contrast, we propose a technique for modeling naturalistic behavior as a set of convex hulls computed over a relatively small dataset of human behavior. Given this set, we design an optimization-based filter which projects arbitrary trajectories into it to make them more naturalistic for autonomous agents to execute while also satisfying dynamics constraints. We demonstrate our methods on real-world human driving data from the inD intersection dataset (Bock et al., 2020).</p></details> |  |

DiPPeST is a zero-shot adaptation of our previously introduced diffusion-based 2D global trajectory generator (DiPPeR). The introduced system incorporates a novel strategy for local real-time path refinements, that is reactive to camera input, without requiring any further training, image processing, or environment interpretation techniques. DiPPeST achieves 92% success rate in obstacle avoidance for nominal environments and an average of 88% success rate when tested in environments that are up to 3.5 times more complex in pixel variation than DiPPeR. A visual-servoing framework is developed to allow for real-world execution, tested on the quadruped robot, achieving 80% success rate in different environments and showcasing improved behavior than complex state-of-the-art local planners, in narrow environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[WTTFNet: A Weather-Time-Trajectory Fusion Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in Urban Complex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18945v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory modelling in an urban complex is challenging because pedestrians can have many possible destinations, such as shops, escalators, and attractions. Moreover, weather and time-of-day may affect pedestrian behavior. In this paper, a new weather-time-trajectory fusion network (WTTFNet) is proposed to improve the performance of baseline deep neural network architecture. By incorporating weather and time-of-day information as an embedding structure, a novel WTTFNet based on gate multimodal unit is used to fuse the multimodal information and deep representation of trajectories. A joint loss function based on focal loss is used to co-optimize both the deep trajectory features and final classifier, which helps to improve the accuracy in predicting the intended destination of pedestrians and hence the trajectories under possible scenarios of class imbalances. Experimental results using the Osaka Asia and Pacific Trade Center (ATC) dataset shows improved performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art algorithms by 23.67% increase in classification accuracy, 9.16% and 7.07% reduction of average and final displacement error. The proposed approach may serve as an attractive approach for improving existing baseline trajectory prediction models when they are applied to scenarios with influences of weather-time conditions. It can be employed in numerous applications such as pedestrian facility engineering, public space development and technology-driven retail.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Goal-Reaching Trajectory Design Near Danger with Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15604v4)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous mobile robots must maintain safety, but should not sacrifice performance, leading to the classical reach-avoid problem: find a trajectory that is guaranteed to reach a goal and avoid obstacles. This paper addresses the near danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off the common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models and ensure safety, but doing so introduces numerical approximation error conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach avoid methods in near-danger goal reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons as athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both the average performance level of the population, $g(t)$, at age $t$ and how each $i$-th athlete differs from the average $f_i(t)$. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into changes from season-to-season, termed the between-season performance trajectory, and within-season performance trajectories which are modelled by a constrained Bernstein polynomial. Hence, the specific focus of this project is to identify the differences in performance that exist both between and within-seasons for each athlete. For the implementation of the model an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is used. An illustration of algorithm's performance on 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming in both female and male athletes is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Learning in Offline RL with Linear $q^π$-Realizability and Concentrability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16809v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

We utilize OpenCV's CSRT algorithm to accurately track the baseball and fixed reference points in 2D video frames. These tracked pixel coordinates are then used as input features for our neural network model, which comprises multiple fully connected layers to map the 2D coordinates to 3D space. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trajectories using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, optimizing the network to minimize prediction errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves high accuracy in reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D inputs. This method shows great potential for applications in sports analysis, coaching, and enhancing the accuracy of trajectory predictions in various sports.</p></details> |  |

Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v2)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of trajectory data in terms of volume, density, and inter-person interactions, limits relevant studies from being comprehensive and interactive. We mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia and tackle the generalization problem stemming from the variety and heterogeneity of the trajectory descriptions. Our ensemble model COSMOS, which combines the idea of semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning, achieves an F1 score of 85.95%. For this task, we also create a hand-curated dataset, WikiLifeTrajectory, consisting of 8,852 (person, time, location) triplets as ground truth. Besides, we perform an empirical analysis on the trajectories of 8,272 historians to demonstrate the validity of the extracted results. To facilitate the research on trajectory extractions and help the analytical studies to construct grand narratives, we make our code, the million-level extracted trajectories, and the WikiLifeTrajectory dataset publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review. 15 pages</p></details> |

Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model ensures the drivability of the predicted trajectory by integrating non-holonomic motion constraints and physical constraints into the generative prediction module. Central to the architecture of cVMD is its capacity to perform uncertainty quantification, a feature that is crucial in safety-critical applications. By integrating the quantified uncertainty into the prediction process, the cVMD's trajectory prediction performance is improved considerably. The model's performance was evaluated using the publicly available highD dataset. Experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves competitive trajectory prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, while providing guaranteed drivable trajectories and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference Workshops (CVPRW) 2024</p></details> |

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |

Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Methods for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline.

Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |

Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates.

We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |

Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |

| **[XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02377v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems help users navigate information overload by providing personalized recommendations aligned with their preferences. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted approach, but while advanced techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) have enhanced CF models for better user representations, they often lack the ability to provide explanations for the recommended items. Explainable recommendations aim to address this gap by offering transparency and insights into the recommendation decision-making process, enhancing users' understanding. This work leverages the language capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of explainable recommender systems. We introduce a model-agnostic framework called XRec, which enables LLMs to provide comprehensive explanations for user behaviors in recommender systems. By integrating collaborative signals and designing a lightweight collaborative adaptor, the framework empowers LLMs to understand complex patterns in user-item interactions and gain a deeper understanding of user preferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of XRec, showcasing its ability to generate comprehensive and meaningful explanations that outperform baseline approaches in explainable recommender systems. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/XRec.</p></details> |  |

Graph rewiring techniques have been utilised on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve expressiveness and increase model performance. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs. TGR enables communication between temporally distant nodes in a continuous time dynamic graph by utilising expander graph propagation to construct a message passing highway for message passing between distant nodes. Expander graphs are suitable candidates for rewiring as they help overcome the oversquashing problem often observed in GNNs. On the public tgbl-wiki benchmark, we show that TGR improves the performance of a widely used TGN model by a significant margin. Our code repository is accessible at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TGR-254C.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

This leads MVGNNs straggles in modality fusion and representations denoising. To address these issues, we propose adaptive modality-wise structure learning (AMoSL). AMoSL captures node correspondences between modalities via optimal transport, and jointly learning with graph embedding. To enable efficient end-to-end training, we employ an efficient solution for the resulting complex bilevel optimization problem. Furthermore, AMoSL adapts to downstream tasks through unsupervised learning on inter-modality distances. The effectiveness of AMoSL is demonstrated by its ability to train more accurate graph classifiers on six benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Heterophily for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09125v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs with heterophily have been regarded as challenging scenarios for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where nodes are connected with dissimilar neighbors through various patterns. In this paper, we present theoretical understandings of the impacts of different heterophily patterns for GNNs by incorporating the graph convolution (GC) operations into fully connected networks via the proposed Heterophilous Stochastic Block Models (HSBM), a general random graph model that can accommodate diverse heterophily patterns. Firstly, we show that by applying a GC operation, the separability gains are determined by two factors, i.e., the Euclidean distance of the neighborhood distributions and $\sqrt{\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]}$, where $\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]$ is the averaged node degree. It reveals that the impact of heterophily on classification needs to be evaluated alongside the averaged node degree. Secondly, we show that the topological noise has a detrimental impact on separability, which is equivalent to degrading $\mathbb{E}\left[\operatorname{deg}\right]$. Finally, when applying multiple GC operations, we show that the separability gains are determined by the normalized distance of the $l$-powered neighborhood distributions. It indicates that the nodes still possess separability as $l$ goes to infinity in a wide range of regimes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of our theory.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Do Not Always Oversmooth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02269v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that the features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, nonoversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Pro: A Self-Prompt and Tuning Framework for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10362v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become an important modeling tool for web applications, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning. However, the performance of traditional GNNs heavily relies on a large amount of supervision. Recently, ``pre-train, fine-tune'' has become the paradigm to address the issues of label dependency and poor generalization. However, the pre-training strategies vary for graphs with homophily and heterophily, and the objectives for various downstream tasks also differ. This leads to a gap between pretexts and downstream tasks, resulting in ``negative transfer'' and poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), many studies turn to bridge the gap and fully leverage the pre-trained model. However, existing methods for graph prompting are tailored to homophily, neglecting inherent heterophily on graphs. Meanwhile, most of them rely on the randomly initialized prompts, which negatively impact on the stability. Therefore, we propose Self-Prompt, a prompting framework for graphs based on the model and data itself. We first introduce asymmetric graph contrastive learning for pretext to address heterophily and align the objectives of pretext and downstream tasks. Then we reuse the component from pre-training phase as the self adapter and introduce self-prompts based on graph itself for task adaptation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets to demonstrate its superiority. We provide our codes at https://github.com/gongchenghua/Self-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[DFA-GNN: Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks by Direct Feedback Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02040v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are recognized for their strong performance across various applications, with the backpropagation algorithm playing a central role in the development of most GNN models. However, despite its effectiveness, BP has limitations that challenge its biological plausibility and affect the efficiency, scalability and parallelism of training neural networks for graph-based tasks. While several non-BP training algorithms, such as the direct feedback alignment, have been successfully applied to fully-connected and convolutional network components for handling Euclidean data, directly adapting these non-BP frameworks to manage non-Euclidean graph data in GNN models presents significant challenges. These challenges primarily arise from the violation of the i.i.d. assumption in graph data and the difficulty in accessing prediction errors for all samples (nodes) within the graph. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper we propose DFA-GNN, a novel forward learning framework tailored for GNNs with a case study of semi-supervised learning. The proposed method breaks the limitations of BP by using a dedicated forward training mechanism. Specifically, DFA-GNN extends the principles of DFA to adapt to graph data and unique architecture of GNNs, which incorporates the information of graph topology into the feedback links to accommodate the non-Euclidean characteristics of graph data. Additionally, for semi-supervised graph learning tasks, we developed a pseudo error generator that spreads residual errors from training data to create a pseudo error for each unlabeled node. These pseudo errors are then utilized to train GNNs using DFA. Extensive experiments on 10 public benchmarks reveal that our learning framework outperforms not only previous non-BP methods but also the standard BP methods, and it exhibits excellent robustness against various types of noise and attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChebMixer: Efficient Graph Representation Learning with MLP Mixer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16358v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in learning graph representations, especially graph Transformer, which has recently shown superior performance on various graph mining tasks. However, graph Transformer generally treats nodes as tokens, which results in quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes during self-attention computation. The graph MLP Mixer addresses this challenge by using the efficient MLP Mixer technique from computer vision. However, the time-consuming process of extracting graph tokens limits its performance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture named ChebMixer, a newly graph MLP Mixer that uses fast Chebyshev polynomials-based spectral filtering to extract a sequence of tokens. Firstly, we produce multiscale representations of graph nodes via fast Chebyshev polynomial-based spectral filtering. Next, we consider each node's multiscale representations as a sequence of tokens and refine the node representation with an effective MLP Mixer. Finally, we aggregate the multiscale representations of nodes through Chebyshev interpolation. Owing to the powerful representation capabilities and fast computational properties of MLP Mixer, we can quickly extract more informative node representations to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The experimental results prove our significant improvements in a variety of scenarios ranging from graph node classification to medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often lose critical information when simplified to lower dimensions and face challenges in parameter definition, especially with the complex 3D shapes commonly found in industrial datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian graph neural network (GNN) framework for a 3D deep-learning-based surrogate model that predicts engineering performance by directly learning geometric features from CAD using mesh representation. Our framework determines the optimal size of mesh elements through Bayesian optimization, resulting in a high-accuracy surrogate model. Additionally, it effectively handles the irregular and complex structures of 3D CADs, which differ significantly from the regular and uniform pixel structures of 2D images typically used in deep learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the quality of the mesh significantly impacts the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model, with an optimally sized mesh achieving superior performance. We compare the performance of models based on various 3D representations such as voxel, point cloud, and graph, and evaluate the computational costs of Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian optimization methods to find the optimal mesh size. We anticipate that our proposed framework has the potential to be applied to mesh-based simulations across various engineering fields, leveraging physics-based information commonly used in computer-aided engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Recently, two distinct approaches have emerged to expedite LP solving: (i) First-order methods (FOMs); (ii) Learning to optimize (L2O). In this work, we propose an FOM-unrolled neural network (NN) called PDHG-Net, and propose a two-stage L2O method to solve large-scale LP problems. The new architecture PDHG-Net is designed by unrolling the recently emerged PDHG method into a neural network, combined with channel-expansion techniques borrowed from graph neural networks. We prove that the proposed PDHG-Net can recover PDHG algorithm, thus can approximate optimal solutions of LP instances with a polynomial number of neurons. We propose a two-stage inference approach: first use PDHG-Net to generate an approximate solution, and then apply PDHG algorithm to further improve the solution. Experiments show that our approach can significantly accelerate LP solving, achieving up to a 3$\times$ speedup compared to FOMs for large-scale LP problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |

With the advent of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), facilitating the representation and processing of graph structures. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in language tasks and are widely adopted in a variety of applications such as computer vision and recommender systems. This remarkable success has also attracted interest in applying LLMs to the graph domain. Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML's generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference. Furthermore, we investigate various applications and discuss the potential future directions in this promising field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Oversmoothing in Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16102v4)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers.

| **[In-Context Learning of Physical Properties: Few-Shot Adaptation to Out-of-Distribution Molecular Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01808v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models manifest the ability of few-shot adaptation to a sequence of provided examples. This behavior, known as in-context learning, allows for performing nontrivial machine learning tasks during inference only. In this work, we address the question: can we leverage in-context learning to predict out-of-distribution materials properties? However, this would not be possible for structure property prediction tasks unless an effective method is found to pass atomic-level geometric features to the transformer model. To address this problem, we employ a compound model in which GPT-2 acts on the output of geometry-aware graph neural networks to adapt in-context information. To demonstrate our model's capabilities, we partition the QM9 dataset into sequences of molecules that share a common substructure and use them for in-context learning. This approach significantly improves the performance of the model on out-of-distribution examples, surpassing the one of general graph neural network models.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Knowledge Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06418v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While a number of knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) methods have been proposed over the past decade, very few theoretical analyses have been conducted on them. In this paper, we present the first PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for KGRL methods. To analyze a broad class of KGRL models, we propose a generic framework named ReED (Relation-aware Encoder-Decoder), which consists of a relation-aware message passing encoder and a triplet classification decoder. Our ReED framework can express at least 15 different existing KGRL models, including not only graph neural network-based models such as R-GCN and CompGCN but also shallow-architecture models such as RotatE and ANALOGY. Our generalization bounds for the ReED framework provide theoretical grounds for the commonly used tricks in KGRL, e.g., parameter-sharing and weight normalization schemes, and guide desirable design choices for practical KGRL methods. We empirically show that the critical factors in our generalization bounds can explain actual generalization errors on three real-world knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21061v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer architecture has recently gained considerable attention in the field of graph representation learning, as it naturally overcomes several limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with customized attention mechanisms or positional and structural encodings. Despite making some progress, existing works tend to overlook external information of graphs, specifically the correlation between graphs. Intuitively, graphs with similar structures should have similar representations. Therefore, we propose Graph External Attention (GEA) -- a novel attention mechanism that leverages multiple external node/edge key-value units to capture inter-graph correlations implicitly. On this basis, we design an effective architecture called Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer (GEAET), which integrates local structure and global interaction information for more comprehensive graph representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GEAET achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance.

The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, we must develop grid analysis algorithms to ensure reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling. The dataset is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PowerGraph/22820534 and the code at https://github.com/PowerGraph-Datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Uplift Modeling Under Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19289v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects in e-commerce tends to involve costly treatment assignments which can be impractical in large-scale settings. Leveraging machine learning to predict such treatment effects without actual intervention is a standard practice to diminish the risk. However, existing methods for treatment effect prediction tend to rely on training sets of substantial size, which are built from real experiments and are thus inherently risky to create. In this work we propose a graph neural network to diminish the required training set size, relying on graphs that are common in e-commerce data. Specifically, we view the problem as node regression with a restricted number of labeled instances, develop a two-model neural architecture akin to previous causal effect estimators, and test varying message-passing layers for encoding. Furthermore, as an extra step, we combine the model with an acquisition function to guide the creation of the training set in settings with extremely low experimental budget. The framework is flexible since each step can be used separately with other models or treatment policies. The experiments on real large-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the state of the art, which in many cases performs close to random, underlining the need for models that can generalize with limited supervision to reduce experimental risks.</p></details> |  |

However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, allowing both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe the exact way the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Since unpaired transmitters and receivers are often spatially distant, the distance-based threshold is proposed to reduce the computation time by excluding or including the channel state information in GNNs. In this paper, we are the first to introduce a neighbour-based threshold approach to GNNs to reduce the time complexity. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of both distance-based and neighbour-based thresholds and provide recommendations for selecting the appropriate value in different communication channel scenarios. We design the corresponding neighbour-based Graph Neural Networks (N-GNN) with the aim of allocating transmit powers to maximise the network throughput. Our results show that our proposed N-GNN offer significant advantages in terms of reducing time complexity while preserving strong performance and generalisation capacity. Besides, we show that by choosing a suitable threshold, the time complexity is reduced from O(|V|^2) to O(|V|), where |V| is the total number of transceiver pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2023 IEEE Global Communications Conference Workshops (GC Workshops)</p></details> |

In this paper, by envisioning depth as a continuous-time embedding evolution, we decouple the HGNN and reframe the information propagation as a partial differential equation, letting node-wise attention undertake the role of diffusivity within the Hyperbolic Neural PDE (HPDE). By introducing theoretical principles \textit{e.g.,} field and flow, gradient, divergence, and diffusivity on a non-Euclidean manifold for HPDE integration, we discuss both implicit and explicit discretization schemes to formulate numerical HPDE solvers. Further, we propose the Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Equation (HGDE) -- a flexible vector flow function that can be integrated to obtain expressive hyperbolic node embeddings. By analyzing potential energy decay of embeddings, we demonstrate that HGDE is capable of modeling both low- and high-order proximity with the benefit of local-global diffusivity functions. Experiments on node classification and link prediction and image-text classification tasks verify the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently outperforms various competitive models by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The short version of this work will appear in the Proceedings of the 2024 European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2024)</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly construct social networks as graph and utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) for bot detection. However, most of these methods focus on how to improve the performance of GNNs while neglecting the community structure within social networks. Moreover, GNNs based methods still face problems such as poor model generalization due to the relatively small scale of the dataset and over-smoothness caused by information propagation mechanism. To address these problems, we propose a Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CACL), which constructs social network as heterogeneous graph with multiple node types and edge types, and then utilizes community-aware module to dynamically mine both hard positive samples and hard negative samples for supervised graph contrastive learning with adaptive graph enhancement algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework addresses the previously mentioned challenges and outperforms competitive baselines on three social media bot benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 findings</p></details> |

Current methods for encoding such graphs typically either (i) linearize them for embedding with LMs -- which underutilize structural information, or (ii) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to preserve the graph structure -- but GNNs cannot represent text features as well as pretrained LMs. In our work we introduce a novel LM type, the Graph Language Model (GLM), that integrates the strengths of both approaches and mitigates their weaknesses. The GLM parameters are initialized from a pretrained LM to enhance understanding of individual graph concepts and triplets. Simultaneously, we design the GLM's architecture to incorporate graph biases, thereby promoting effective knowledge distribution within the graph. This enables GLMs to process graphs, texts, and interleaved inputs of both. Empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks show that GLM embeddings surpass both LM- and GNN-based baselines in supervised and zero-shot setting, demonstrating their versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2024. 9 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Equivariant Machine Learning on Graphs with Nonlinear Spectral Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01249v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space. We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flood and Echo Net: Algorithmically Aligned GNNs that Generalize](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06970v3)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Graph Neural Networks follow the standard message-passing framework where, in each step, all nodes simultaneously communicate with each other. We want to challenge this paradigm by aligning the computation more closely to the execution of distributed algorithms and propose the Flood and Echo Net. A single round of a Flood and Echo Net consists of an origin node and a flooding phase followed by an echo phase. First, during the flooding, messages are sent from the origin and propagated outwards throughout the entire graph. Then, during the echo, the message flow reverses and messages are sent back towards the origin. As nodes are only sparsely activated upon receiving a message, this leads to a wave-like activation pattern that traverses the graph. Through these sparse but parallel activations, the Net becomes more expressive than traditional MPNNs which are limited by the 1-WL test and also is provably more efficient in terms of message complexity. Moreover, the mechanism's inherent ability to generalize across graphs of varying sizes positions it as a practical architecture for the task of algorithmic learning. We test the Flood and Echo Net on a variety of synthetic tasks and the SALSA-CLRS benchmark and find that the algorithmic alignment of the execution improves generalization to larger graph sizes.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions, particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |

Existing LLM reasoning methods overlook the importance of compositional learning on KG to supply with precise knowledge. Besides, the fine-tuning and frequent interaction with LLMs incur substantial time and resource costs. This paper focuses on the Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) task and proposes an Explore-then-Determine (EtD) framework that synergizes LLMs with graph neural networks (GNNs) for reasoning over KGs. The Explore stage employs a lightweight GNN to explore promising candidates and relevant fine-grained knowledge to the questions, while the Determine stage utilizes the explored information to construct a knowledge-enhanced multiple-choice prompt, guiding a frozen LLM to determine the final answer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that EtD achieves state-of-the-art performance and generates faithful reasoning results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Mutual Learning of Dialogue Discourse Parsing and Topic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19799v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has propelled the development of dialogue systems. Unlike the popular ChatGPT-like assistant model, which only satisfies the user's preferences, task-oriented dialogue systems have also faced new requirements and challenges in the broader business field. They are expected to provide correct responses at each dialogue turn, at the same time, achieve the overall goal defined by the task. By understanding rhetorical structures and topic structures via topic segmentation and discourse parsing, a dialogue system may do a better planning to achieve both objectives. However, while both structures belong to discourse structure in linguistics, rhetorical structure and topic structure are mostly modeled separately or with one assisting the other in the prior work. The interaction between these two structures has not been considered for joint modeling and mutual learning. Furthermore, unsupervised learning techniques to achieve the above are not well explored. To fill this gap, we propose an unsupervised mutual learning framework of two structures leveraging the global and local connections between them. We extend the topic modeling between non-adjacent discourse units to ensure global structural relevance with rhetorical structures. We also incorporate rhetorical structures into the topic structure through a graph neural network model to ensure local coherence consistency. Finally, we utilize the similarity between the two fused structures for mutual learning. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods outperform all strong baselines on two dialogue rhetorical datasets (STAC and Molweni), as well as dialogue topic datasets (Doc2Dial and TIAGE).

In this work, we propose GNCE, a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to accurately predict the cardinality of conjunctive queries. GNCE first creates semantically meaningful embeddings for all entities in the KG, which are then integrated into the given query, which is processed by a GNN to estimate the cardinality of the query. We evaluate GNCE on several KGs in terms of q-Error and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches based on sampling, summaries, and (machine) learning in terms of estimation accuracy while also having lower execution time and less parameters. Additionally, we show that GNCE can inductively generalise to unseen entities, making it suitable for use in dynamic query processing scenarios. Our proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve query optimization and related applications that rely on accurate cardinality estimates of conjunctive queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Aware Dynamic Reweighting for Distribution Shifts on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01066v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification tasks but often fail to generalize when training and test nodes come from different distributions, limiting their practicality. To overcome this, recent approaches adopt invariant learning techniques from the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization field, which seek to establish stable prediction methods across environments. However, the applicability of these invariant assumptions to graph data remains unverified, and such methods often lack solid theoretical support. In this work, we introduce the Topology-Aware Dynamic Reweighting (TAR) framework, which dynamically adjusts sample weights through gradient flow in the geometric Wasserstein space during training. Instead of relying on strict invariance assumptions, we prove that our method is able to provide distributional robustness, thereby enhancing the out-of-distribution generalization performance on graph data. By leveraging the inherent graph structure, TAR effectively addresses distribution shifts. Our framework's superiority is demonstrated through standard testing on four graph OOD datasets and three class-imbalanced node classification datasets, exhibiting marked improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, molecular data encompasses more than just graph structures, including textual and visual information that GNNs do not handle well. To bridge this gap, we present an innovative framework that utilizes multimodal molecular data to extract insights from Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce GALLON (Graph Learning from Large Language Model Distillation), a framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs and GNNs by distilling multimodal knowledge into a unified Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). This method integrates the rich textual and visual data of molecules with the structural analysis power of GNNs. Extensive experiments reveal that our distilled MLP model notably improves the accuracy and efficiency of molecular property predictions.</p></details> |  |

Most HGNN models leverage attention mechanisms to significantly improvemodel accuracy, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. Fortunately, the attention disparity from source vertices towards a common target vertex unveils an opportunity to boost the model execution performance by pruning unimportant source vertices during neighbor aggregation. In this study, we commence with a quantitative analysis of the attention disparity in HGNN models, where the importance of different source vertices varies for the same target vertex. To fully exploit this finding for inference acceleration, we propose a runtime pruning method based on min-heap and map it to a dedicated hardware pruner to discard unimportant vertices. Given that the pruning overhead itself is non-negligible and cannot be amortized by conventional staged execution paradigm, an operation-fusion execution fow of HGNNs is introduced to overlap the pruning overhead while harnessing inter-stage parallelism. Finally, we present the design of a novel HGNN accelerator, ADE-HGNN, tailored to support the proposed execution framework. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADE-HGNN achieves an average performance improvement of 28.21x over the NVIDIA GPU T4 platform and 7.98x over the advanced GPU A100, with the inference accuracy loss kept within a negligible range of 0.11%~1.47%. Furthermore, ADE-HGNN significantly reduces energy consumption to 1.97% and 5.37% of the two platforms, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, accepted by Euro-PAR 2024</p></details> |

However, applications involving graph-structured data remain a tough nut for foundation models, due to challenges in the unique feature- and label spaces associated with each graph. Traditional graph ML models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on graphs cannot perform inference on a new graph with feature and label spaces different from the training ones. Furthermore, existing models learn functions specific to the training graph and cannot generalize to new graphs. In this work, we tackle these two challenges with a new foundational architecture for inductive node classification named GraphAny. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, thereby solving the first challenge. To solve the second challenge, we learn attention scores for each node to fuse the predictions of multiple LinearGNNs. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance-features between multiple LinearGNNs predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on the Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can effectively generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26\% in an inductive manner, surpassing GCN and GAT trained in the supervised regime, as well as other inductive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

With a long history in network science, community detection typically relies on objective functions, optimised with custom-tailored search algorithms, but often without leveraging recent advances in deep learning. Recently, first works have started incorporating such objectives into loss functions for neural graph clustering and pooling. We consider the map equation, a popular information-theoretic objective function for unsupervised community detection, and express it in differentiable tensor form for optimisation through gradient descent. Our formulation turns the map equation compatible with any neural network architecture, enables end-to-end learning, incorporates node features, and chooses the optimal number of clusters automatically, all without requiring explicit regularisation. Applied to unsupervised graph clustering tasks, we achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art neural graph clustering baselines in synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 27 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for ill-conditioned problems, in part because they better approximate the matrix inverse from appropriately generated training data. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable than other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few.</p></details> |  |
| **[IENE: Identifying and Extrapolating the Node Environment for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00764v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the performance degradation of graph neural networks (GNNs) under distribution shifts, the work on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs has received widespread attention. A novel perspective involves distinguishing potential confounding biases from different environments through environmental identification, enabling the model to escape environmentally-sensitive correlations and maintain stable performance under distribution shifts. However, in graph data, confounding factors not only affect the generation process of node features but also influence the complex interaction between nodes. We observe that neglecting either aspect of them will lead to a decrease in performance. In this paper, we propose IENE, an OOD generalization method on graphs based on node-level environmental identification and extrapolation techniques. It strengthens the model's ability to extract invariance from two granularities simultaneously, leading to improved generalization. Specifically, to identify invariance in features, we utilize the disentangled information bottleneck framework to achieve mutual promotion between node-level environmental estimation and invariant feature learning. Furthermore, we extrapolate topological environments through graph augmentation techniques to identify structural invariance. We implement the conceptual method with specific algorithms and provide theoretical analysis and proofs for our approach. Extensive experimental evaluations on two synthetic and four real-world OOD datasets validate the superiority of IENE, which outperforms existing techniques and provides a flexible framework for enhancing the generalization of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods do not consider this property into neural networks for image deraining, thus affecting recovery performance. Motivated by this property, we find that there exists significant patch recurrence property of a rainy image, that is, similar patches tend to recur many times in one image and its multi-scale images and external images. To better model this property for image detaining, we develop a multi-scale graph network with exemplars, called MSGNN, that contains two branches: 1) internal data-based supervised branch is used to model the internal relations of similar patches from the rainy image itself and its multi-scale images and 2) external data-participated unsupervised branch is used to model the external relations of the similar patches in the rainy image and exemplar. Specifically, we construct a graph model by searching the k-nearest neighboring patches from both the rainy images in a multi-scale framework and the exemplar. After obtaining the corresponding k neighboring patches from the multi-scale images and exemplar, we build a graph and aggregate them in an attentional manner so that the graph can provide more information from similar patches for image deraining. We embed the proposed graph in a deep neural network and train it in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against eight state-of-the-art methods on five public synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset.

| **[Weisfeiler Leman for Euclidean Equivariant Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02484v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The $k$-Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$-WL) graph isomorphism test hierarchy is a common method for assessing the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs). Recently, GNNs whose expressive power is equivalent to the $2$-WL test were proven to be universal on weighted graphs which encode $3\mathrm{D}$ point cloud data, yet this result is limited to invariant continuous functions on point clouds. In this paper, we extend this result in three ways: Firstly, we show that PPGN can simulate $2$-WL uniformly on all point clouds with low complexity. Secondly, we show that $2$-WL tests can be extended to point clouds which include both positions and velocities, a scenario often encountered in applications. Finally, we provide a general framework for proving equivariant universality and leverage it to prove that a simple modification of this invariant PPGN architecture can be used to obtain a universal equivariant architecture that can approximate all continuous equivariant functions uniformly. Building on our results, we develop our WeLNet architecture, which sets new state-of-the-art results on the N-Body dynamics task and the GEOM-QM9 molecular conformation generation task.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-CBA: Explainability Aided CatBoosted Anomal-E for Intrusion Detection System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00839v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is critical in an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly complex. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying attacks and anomalies in computer networks. However, using ML and DL models in IDS has led to a trust deficit due to their non-transparent decision-making. This transparency gap in IDS research is significant, affecting confidence and accountability. To address, this paper introduces a novel Explainable IDS approach, called X-CBA, that leverages the structural advantages of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to effectively process network traffic data, while also adapting a new Explainable AI (XAI) methodology. Unlike most GNN-based IDS that depend on labeled network traffic and node features, thereby overlooking critical packet-level information, our approach leverages a broader range of traffic data through network flows, including edge attributes, to improve detection capabilities and adapt to novel threats. Through empirical testing, we establish that our approach not only achieves high accuracy with 99.47% in threat detection but also advances the field by providing clear, actionable explanations of its analytical outcomes. This research also aims to bridge the current gap and facilitate the broader integration of ML/DL technologies in cybersecurity defenses by offering a local and global explainability solution that is both precise and interpretable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Graph Neural Operator for Modeling 3D Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11037v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the complex three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of relational systems is an important problem in the natural sciences, with applications ranging from molecular simulations to particle mechanics. Machine learning methods have achieved good success by learning graph neural networks to model spatial interactions. However, these approaches do not faithfully capture temporal correlations since they only model next-step predictions. In this work, we propose Equivariant Graph Neural Operator (EGNO), a novel and principled method that directly models dynamics as trajectories instead of just next-step prediction. Different from existing methods, EGNO explicitly learns the temporal evolution of 3D dynamics where we formulate the dynamics as a function over time and learn neural operators to approximate it. To capture the temporal correlations while keeping the intrinsic SE(3)-equivariance, we develop equivariant temporal convolutions parameterized in the Fourier space and build EGNO by stacking the Fourier layers over equivariant networks. EGNO is the first operator learning framework that is capable of modeling solution dynamics functions over time while retaining 3D equivariance. Comprehensive experiments in multiple domains, including particle simulations, human motion capture, and molecular dynamics, demonstrate the significantly superior performance of EGNO against existing methods, thanks to the equivariant temporal modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/MinkaiXu/egno.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria.

| **[Future Directions in the Theory of Graph Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02287v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Graph Neural Network Training Systems: A Performance Comparison of Full-Graph and Mini-Batch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00552v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to learn representations of graph structured data. Two common methods for training GNNs are mini-batch training and full-graph training. Since these two methods require different training pipelines and systems optimizations, two separate categories of GNN training systems emerged, each tailored for one method. Works that introduce systems belonging to a particular category predominantly compare them with other systems within the same category, offering limited or no comparison with systems from the other category. Some prior work also justifies its focus on one specific training method by arguing that it achieves higher accuracy than the alternative. The literature, however, has incomplete and contradictory evidence in this regard. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of full-graph and mini-batch GNN training systems to get a clearer picture of the state of the art in the field. We find that the mini-batch training systems we consider consistently converge faster than the full-graph training ones across multiple datasets, GNN models, and system configurations, with speedups between 2.4x - 15.2x. We also find that both training techniques converge to similar accuracy values, so comparing systems across the two categories in terms of time-to-accuracy is a sound approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 appendix, 8 Figures, 16 Tables, Graph Neural Network, Graph Neural Networks, Full-graph training, Mini-batch training, full-batch training, distributed training, performance, epoch time, time to accuracy, accuracy</p></details> |

In particular, a recent study proposes an algorithm to protect each user's feature vector in an attributed graph, which includes feature vectors along with node IDs and edges, with LDP (Local Differential Privacy), a strong privacy notion without a trusted third party. However, this algorithm does not protect edges (friendships) in a social graph, hence cannot protect user privacy in unattributed graphs, which include only node IDs and edges. How to provide strong privacy with high accuracy in unattributed graphs remains open. In this paper, we propose a novel LDP algorithm called the DPRR (Degree-Preserving Randomized Response) to provide LDP for edges in GNNs. Our DPRR preserves each user's degree hence a graph structure while providing edge LDP. Technically, our DPRR uses Warner's RR (Randomized Response) and strategic edge sampling, where each user's sampling probability is automatically tuned using the Laplacian mechanism to preserve the degree information under edge LDP. We also propose a privacy budget allocation method to make the noise in both Warner's RR and the Laplacian mechanism small. We focus on graph classification as a task of GNNs and evaluate the DPRR using three social graph datasets. Our experimental results show that the DPRR significantly outperforms three baselines and provides accuracy close to a non-private algorithm in all datasets with a reasonable privacy budget, e.g., epsilon=1. Finally, we introduce data poisoning attacks to our DPRR and a defense against the attacks. We evaluate them using the three social graph datasets and discuss the experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Data Privacy</p></details> |
| **[Dual-perspective Cross Contrastive Learning in Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00403v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a popular method for leaning graph representations by maximizing the consistency of features across augmented views. Traditional GCL methods utilize single-perspective i.e. data or model-perspective) augmentation to generate positive samples, restraining the diversity of positive samples. In addition, these positive samples may be unreliable due to uncontrollable augmentation strategies that potentially alter the semantic information. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a innovative framework termed dual-perspective cross graph contrastive learning (DC-GCL), which incorporates three modifications designed to enhance positive sample diversity and reliability: 1) We propose dual-perspective augmentation strategy that provide the model with more diverse training data, enabling the model effective learning of feature consistency across different views. 2) From the data perspective, we slightly perturb the original graphs using controllable data augmentation, effectively preserving their semantic information. 3) From the model perspective, we enhance the encoder by utilizing more powerful graph transformers instead of graph neural networks. Based on the model's architecture, we propose three pruning-based strategies to slightly perturb the encoder, providing more reliable positive samples. These modifications collectively form the DC-GCL's foundation and provide more diverse and reliable training inputs, offering significant improvements over traditional GCL methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-GCL consistently outperforms different baselines on various datasets and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Graph Pooling with Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16346v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been an emerging trend to integrate persistent homology (PH) into graph neural networks (GNNs) to enrich expressive power. However, naively plugging PH features into GNN layers always results in marginal improvement with low interpretability. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism for injecting global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, motivated by the observation that filtration operation in PH naturally aligns graph pooling in a cut-off manner. In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance. Experimentally, we apply our mechanism to a collection of graph pooling methods and observe consistent and substantial performance gain over several popular datasets, demonstrating its wide applicability and flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Realized GNN Expressiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07702v4)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on the theoretical expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has developed rapidly, and many methods have been proposed to enhance the expressiveness. However, most methods do not have a uniform expressiveness measure except for a few that strictly follow the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman ($k$-WL) test hierarchy, leading to difficulties in quantitatively comparing their expressiveness. Previous research has attempted to use datasets for measurement, but facing problems with difficulty (any model surpassing 1-WL has nearly 100% accuracy), granularity (models tend to be either 100% correct or near random guess), and scale (only several essentially different graphs involved). To address these limitations, we study the realized expressive power that a practical model instance can achieve using a novel expressiveness dataset, BREC, which poses greater difficulty (with up to 4-WL-indistinguishable graphs), finer granularity (enabling comparison of models between 1-WL and 3-WL), a larger scale (consisting of 800 1-WL-indistinguishable graphs that are non-isomorphic to each other). We synthetically test 23 models with higher-than-1-WL expressiveness on BREC. Our experiment gives the first thorough measurement of the realized expressiveness of those state-of-the-art beyond-1-WL GNN models and reveals the gap between theoretical and realized expressiveness. Dataset and evaluation codes are released at: https://github.com/GraphPKU/BREC.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2201.12884 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[PSP: Pre-Training and Structure Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17394v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful in learning semantics of graph data. Recently, a new paradigm "pre-train and prompt" has shown promising results in adapting GNNs to various tasks with less supervised data. The success of such paradigm can be attributed to the more consistent objectives of pre-training and task-oriented prompt tuning, where the pre-trained knowledge can be effectively transferred to downstream tasks. Most existing methods are based on the class prototype vector framework. However, in the few-shot scenarios, given few labeled data, class prototype vectors are difficult to be accurately constructed or learned. Meanwhile, the structure information of graph is usually exploited during pre-training for learning node representations, while neglected in the prompt tuning stage for learning more accurate prototype vectors. In addition, they generally ignore the impact of heterophilous neighborhoods on node representation and are not suitable for heterophilous graphs. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel pre-training and structure prompt tuning framework for GNNs, namely PSP, which consistently exploits structure information in both pre-training and prompt tuning stages. In particular, PSP 1) employs a dual-view contrastive learning to align the latent semantic spaces of node attributes and graph structure, and 2) incorporates structure information in prompted graph to construct more accurate prototype vectors and elicit more pre-trained knowledge in prompt tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on node classification and graph classification tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of PSP. We show that PSP can lead to superior performance in few-shot scenarios on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. The implemented code is available at https://github.com/gqq1210/PSP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Reconstructing Graph Diffusion History from a Single Snapshot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00488v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion on graphs is ubiquitous with numerous high-impact applications. In these applications, complete diffusion histories play an essential role in terms of identifying dynamical patterns, reflecting on precaution actions, and forecasting intervention effects. Despite their importance, complete diffusion histories are rarely available and are highly challenging to reconstruct due to ill-posedness, explosive search space, and scarcity of training data. To date, few methods exist for diffusion history reconstruction. They are exclusively based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) formulation and require to know true diffusion parameters. In this paper, we study an even harder problem, namely reconstructing Diffusion history from A single SnapsHot} (DASH), where we seek to reconstruct the history from only the final snapshot without knowing true diffusion parameters. We start with theoretical analyses that reveal a fundamental limitation of the MLE formulation. We prove: (a) estimation error of diffusion parameters is unavoidable due to NP-hardness of diffusion parameter estimation, and (b) the MLE formulation is sensitive to estimation error of diffusion parameters. To overcome the inherent limitation of the MLE formulation, we propose a novel barycenter formulation: finding the barycenter of the posterior distribution of histories, which is provably stable against the estimation error of diffusion parameters. We further develop an effective solver named DIffusion hiTting Times with Optimal proposal (DITTO) by reducing the problem to estimating posterior expected hitting times via the Metropolis--Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo method (M--H MCMC) and employing an unsupervised graph neural network to learn an optimal proposal to accelerate the convergence of M--H MCMC. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the KDD 2023 paper (including the appendix)</p></details> |

Our objective is to address the challenge of scaling edge-based graph neural networks as the number of nodes increases. Through our distributed training approach, coupled with Nystr\"om-approximation sampling techniques, we present a scalable graph neural network, referred to as DS-MPNN (D and S standing for distributed and sampled, respectively), capable of scaling up to $O(10^5)$ nodes. We validate our sampling and distributed training approach on two cases: (a) a Darcy flow dataset and (b) steady RANS simulations of 2-D airfoils, providing comparisons with both single-GPU implementation and node-based graph convolution networks (GCNs). The DS-MPNN model demonstrates comparable accuracy to single-GPU implementation, can accommodate a significantly larger number of nodes compared to the single-GPU variant (S-MPNN), and significantly outperforms the node-based GCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Inference of Removal-Based Node Influence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08333v3)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely utilized to capture the information spreading patterns in graphs. While remarkable performance has been achieved, there is a new trending topic of evaluating node influence. We propose a new method of evaluating node influence, which measures the prediction change of a trained GNN model caused by removing a node. A real-world application is, "In the task of predicting Twitter accounts' polarity, had a particular account been removed, how would others' polarity change?". We use the GNN as a surrogate model whose prediction could simulate the change of nodes or edges caused by node removal. Our target is to obtain the influence score for every node, and a straightforward way is to alternately remove every node and apply the trained GNN on the modified graph to generate new predictions. It is reliable but time-consuming, so we need an efficient method. The related lines of work, such as graph adversarial attack and counterfactual explanation, cannot directly satisfy our needs, since their problem settings are different. We propose an efficient, intuitive, and effective method, NOde-Removal-based fAst GNN inference (NORA), which uses the gradient information to approximate the node-removal influence. It only costs one forward propagation and one backpropagation to approximate the influence score for all nodes. Extensive experiments on six datasets and six GNN models verify the effectiveness of NORA.

Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Active Sensing for Multiuser Beam Tracking with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03129v2)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs). Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem, because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open Ad Hoc Teamwork with Cooperative Game Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15259v3)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ad hoc teamwork poses a challenging problem, requiring the design of an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination or joint training. Open ad hoc teamwork (OAHT) further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. One promising solution in practice to this problem is leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks to handle an unrestricted number of agents, named graph-based policy learning (GPL). However, its joint Q-value representation over a coordination graph lacks convincing explanations. In this paper, we establish a new theory to understand the joint Q-value representation for OAHT, from the perspective of cooperative game theory, and validate its learning paradigm. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm named CIAO, compatible with GPL framework, with additional provable implementation tricks that can facilitate learning.

Despite GNNs and HNs being individually successful, we show that GHNs present problems compromising their performance, such as over-smoothing and heterophily. Moreover, we cannot apply GHNs directly to personalized federated learning (PFL) scenarios, where a priori client relation graph may be absent, private, or inaccessible. To mitigate these limitations in the context of PFL, we propose a novel class of HNs, sheaf hypernetworks (SHNs), which combine cellular sheaf theory with HNs to improve parameter sharing for PFL. We thoroughly evaluate SHNs across diverse PFL tasks, including multi-class classification, traffic and weather forecasting. Additionally, we provide a methodology for constructing client relation graphs in scenarios where such graphs are unavailable. We show that SHNs consistently outperform existing PFL solutions in complex non-IID scenarios. While the baselines' performance fluctuates depending on the task, SHNs show improvements of up to 2.7% in accuracy and 5.3% in lower mean squared error over the best-performing baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables, pre-print under review</p></details> |
| **[SelfGNN: Self-Supervised Graph Neural Networks for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20878v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation effectively addresses information overload by modeling users' temporal and sequential interaction patterns. To overcome the limitations of supervision signals, recent approaches have adopted self-supervised learning techniques in recommender systems. However, there are still two critical challenges that remain unsolved. Firstly, existing sequential models primarily focus on long-term modeling of individual interaction sequences, overlooking the valuable short-term collaborative relationships among the behaviors of different users. Secondly, real-world data often contain noise, particularly in users' short-term behaviors, which can arise from temporary intents or misclicks. Such noise negatively impacts the accuracy of both graph and sequence models, further complicating the modeling process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network (SelfGNN) for sequential recommendation. The SelfGNN framework encodes short-term graphs based on time intervals and utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn short-term collaborative relationships. It captures long-term user and item representations at multiple granularity levels through interval fusion and dynamic behavior modeling. Importantly, our personalized self-augmented learning structure enhances model robustness by mitigating noise in short-term graphs based on long-term user interests and personal stability. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SelfGNN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Our model implementation codes are available at https://github.com/HKUDS/SelfGNN.</p></details> | Accepted by SIGIR'24 |
| **[Robust Collaborative Perception without External Localization and Clock Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02965v2)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A consistent spatial-temporal coordination across multiple agents is fundamental for collaborative perception, which seeks to improve perception abilities through information exchange among agents. To achieve this spatial-temporal alignment, traditional methods depend on external devices to provide localization and clock signals. However, hardware-generated signals could be vulnerable to noise and potentially malicious attack, jeopardizing the precision of spatial-temporal alignment. Rather than relying on external hardwares, this work proposes a novel approach: aligning by recognizing the inherent geometric patterns within the perceptual data of various agents. Following this spirit, we propose a robust collaborative perception system that operates independently of external localization and clock devices. The key module of our system,~\emph{FreeAlign}, constructs a salient object graph for each agent based on its detected boxes and uses a graph neural network to identify common subgraphs between agents, leading to accurate relative pose and time.

However, applying hypernetworks in FL, while aiming to facilitate model personalization, often encounters challenges due to inadequate representation of client-specific characteristics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model called FedSheafHN, using enhanced collaboration graph embedding and efficient personalized model parameter generation. Specifically, our model embeds each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph. We utilize sheaf diffusion in the collaboration graph to learn client representations. Our model improves the integration and interpretation of complex client characteristics. Furthermore, our model ensures the generation of personalized models through advanced hypernetworks optimized for parallel operations across clients. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing methods in most scenarios, in terms of client model performance on various graph-structured datasets. It also has fast model convergence and effective new clients generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to ICML 2024 in Feb 2024.

| **[Network Analytics for Anti-Money Laundering -- A Systematic Literature Review and Experimental Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19383v2)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Money laundering presents a pervasive challenge, burdening society by financing illegal activities. To more effectively combat and detect money laundering, the use of network information is increasingly being explored, exploiting that money laundering necessarily involves interconnected parties. This has lead to a surge in literature on network analytics (NA) for anti-money laundering (AML). The literature, however, is fragmented and a comprehensive overview of existing work is missing. This results in limited understanding of the methods that may be applied and their comparative detection power. Therefore, this paper presents an extensive and systematic review of the literature. We identify and analyse 97 papers in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, resulting in a taxonomy of approaches following the fraud analytics framework of Bockel-Rickermann et al.. Moreover, this paper presents a comprehensive experimental framework to evaluate and compare the performance of prominent NA methods in a uniform setup. The framework is applied on the publicly available Elliptic data set and implements manual feature engineering, random walk-based methods, and deep learning GNNs. We conclude from the results that network analytics increases the predictive power of the AML model with graph neural networks giving the best results. An open source implementation of the experimental framework is provided to facilitate researchers and practitioners to extend upon these results and experiment on proprietary data. As such, we aim to promote a standardised approach towards the analysis and evaluation of network analytics for AML.</p></details> |  |

To empower GNNs in heterophilic graphs, where adjacent nodes exhibit dissimilar labels or features, Signed Message Passing (SMP) has been widely adopted. However, there is a lack of theoretical and empirical analysis regarding the limitations of SMP. In this work, we unveil some potential pitfalls of SMP and their remedies. We first identify two limitations of SMP: undesirable representation update for multi-hop neighbors and vulnerability against oversmoothing issues. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel message passing function called Multiset to Multiset GNN(M2M-GNN). Our theoretical analyses and extensive experiments demonstrate that M2M-GNN effectively alleviates the aforementioned limitations of SMP, yielding superior performance in comparison</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Heterophilous Distribution Propagation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20640v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph mining tasks by aggregating information from neighborhoods for representation learning. The success relies on the homophily assumption that nearby nodes exhibit similar behaviors, while it may be violated in many real-world graphs. Recently, heterophilous graph neural networks (HeterGNNs) have attracted increasing attention by modifying the neural message passing schema for heterophilous neighborhoods. However, they suffer from insufficient neighborhood partition and heterophily modeling, both of which are critical but challenging to break through. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose heterophilous distribution propagation (HDP) for graph neural networks. Instead of aggregating information from all neighborhoods, HDP adaptively separates the neighbors into homophilous and heterphilous parts based on the pseudo assignments during training. The heterophilous neighborhood distribution is learned with orthogonality-oriented constraint via a trusted prototype contrastive learning paradigm. Both the homophilous and heterophilous patterns are propagated with a novel semantic-aware message passing mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets with different levels of homophily. Experimental results show that our method outperforms representative baselines on heterophilous datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSPI: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Classification Aggregation Algorithm Based on Size Neighbor Path Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18933v2)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing heterogeneous graph neural network algorithms (HGNNs) mostly rely on meta-paths to capture the rich semantic information contained in heterogeneous graphs (also known as heterogeneous information networks (HINs)), but most of these HGNNs focus on different ways of feature aggre gation and ignore the properties of the meta-paths themselves. This paper studies meta-paths in three commonly used data sets and finds that there are huge differences in the number of neighbors connected by different meta paths. At the same time, the noise information contained in large neigh bor paths will have an adverse impact on model performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Classification and Aggregation Algorithm Based on Large and Small Neighbor Path Iden tification(LSPI). LSPI firstly divides the meta-paths into large and small neighbor paths through the path discriminator , and in order to reduce the noise interference problem in large neighbor paths, LSPI selects neighbor nodes with higher similarity from both topology and feature perspectives, and passes small neighbor paths and filtered large neighbor paths through different graph convolution components. Aggregation is performed to obtain feature information under different subgraphs, and then LSPI uses subgraph level attention to fuse the feature information under different subgraphs to generate the final node embedding. Finally this paper verifies the superiority of the method through extensive experiments and also gives suggestions on the number of nodes to be retained in large neighbor paths through exper iments. The complete reproducible code adn data has been published at: https://github.com/liuhua811/LSPIA.</p></details> |  |

However, the use of GNNs (and machine learning more generally) to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems is much less explored. Here, we introduce a novel GNN architecture which leverages a complex filter bank and localized attention mechanisms designed to solve CO problems on graphs. We show how our method differentiates itself from prior GNN-based CO solvers and how it can be effectively applied to the maximum clique, minimum dominating set, and maximum cut problems in a self-supervised learning setting. In addition to demonstrating competitive overall performance across all tasks, we establish state-of-the-art results for the max cut problem.</p></details> | 15 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Position: Graph Foundation Models are Already Here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02216v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are emerging as a significant research topic in the graph domain, aiming to develop graph models trained on extensive and diverse data to enhance their applicability across various tasks and domains. Developing GFMs presents unique challenges over traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are typically trained from scratch for specific tasks on particular datasets. The primary challenge in constructing GFMs lies in effectively leveraging vast and diverse graph data to achieve positive transfer. Drawing inspiration from existing foundation models in the CV and NLP domains, we propose a novel perspective for the GFM development by advocating for a ``graph vocabulary'', in which the basic transferable units underlying graphs encode the invariance on graphs. We ground the graph vocabulary construction from essential aspects including network analysis, expressiveness, and stability. Such a vocabulary perspective can potentially advance the future GFM design in line with the neural scaling laws. All relevant resources with GFM design can be found here.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Graph as Point Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02795v2)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph is a fundamental data structure to model interconnections between entities. Set, on the contrary, stores independent elements. To learn graph representations, current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily use message passing to encode the interconnections. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel graph-to-set conversion method that bijectively transforms interconnected nodes into a set of independent points and then uses a set encoder to learn the graph representation. This conversion method holds dual significance. Firstly, it enables using set encoders to learn from graphs, thereby significantly expanding the design space of GNNs. Secondly, for Transformer, a specific set encoder, we provide a novel and principled approach to inject graph information losslessly, different from all the heuristic structural/positional encoding methods adopted in previous graph transformers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce Point Set Transformer (PST), a transformer architecture that accepts a point set converted from a graph as input. Theoretically, PST exhibits superior expressivity for both short-range substructure counting and long-range shortest path distance tasks compared to existing GNNs. Extensive experiments further validate PST's outstanding real-world performance. Besides Transformer, we also devise a Deepset-based set encoder, which achieves performance comparable to representative GNNs, affirming the versatility of our graph-to-set method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in ICML 2024</p></details> |

Question Answering over KGs (KGQA) is the task of answering natural questions grounding the reasoning to the information provided by the KG. Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models for QA tasks due to their remarkable ability to understand natural language. On the other hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for KGQA as they can handle the complex graph information stored in the KG. In this work, we introduce GNN-RAG, a novel method for combining language understanding abilities of LLMs with the reasoning abilities of GNNs in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style. First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for a given question. Second, the shortest paths in the KG that connect question entities and answer candidates are extracted to represent KG reasoning paths. The extracted paths are verbalized and given as input for LLM reasoning with RAG. In our GNN-RAG framework, the GNN acts as a dense subgraph reasoner to extract useful graph information, while the LLM leverages its natural language processing ability for ultimate KGQA. Furthermore, we develop a retrieval augmentation (RA) technique to further boost KGQA performance with GNN-RAG. Experimental results show that GNN-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in two widely used KGQA benchmarks (WebQSP and CWQ), outperforming or matching GPT-4 performance with a 7B tuned LLM. In addition, GNN-RAG excels on multi-hop and multi-entity questions outperforming competing approaches by 8.9--15.5% points at answer F1.</p></details> |  |

Recently, GNNs have been widely applied in various domains, but they also face some issues, such as overfitting, over-smoothing and non-robustness. The existing research indicates that random dropout methods are an effective way to address these issues. However, random dropout methods in GNNs still face unresolved problems. Currently, the choice of dropout rate, often determined by heuristic or grid search methods, can increase the generalization error, contradicting the principal aims of dropout. In this paper, we propose a novel random dropout method for GNNs called FlexiDrop. First, we conduct a theoretical analysis of dropout in GNNs using rademacher complexity and demonstrate that the generalization error of traditional random dropout methods is constrained by a function related to the dropout rate. Subsequently, we use this function as a regularizer to unify the dropout rate and empirical loss within a single loss function, optimizing them simultaneously. Therefore, our method enables adaptive adjustment of the dropout rate and theoretically balances the trade-off between model complexity and generalization ability. Furthermore, extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets show that FlexiDrop outperforms traditional random dropout methods in GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, many PINN-like methods are poorly scalable and are limited to in-sample scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel discrete approach termed Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (PIGNN) to solve forward and inverse nonlinear PDEs. In particular, our approach seamlessly integrates the strength of graph neural networks (GNN), physical equations and finite difference to approximate solutions of physical systems. Our approach is compared with the PINN baseline on three well-known nonlinear PDEs (heat, Burgers and FitzHugh-Nagumo). We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method to work with irregular meshes, longer time steps, arbitrary spatial resolutions, varying initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) by conducting extensive numerical experiments. Numerical results also illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, time extrapolability, generalizability and scalability. The main advantage of our approach is that models trained in small domains with simple settings have excellent fitting capabilities and can be directly applied to more complex situations in large domains.</p></details> |  |

As task-relevant relations might be unknown, graph structure learning approaches have been proposed to learn them while solving the downstream prediction task. In this paper, we demonstrate that minimization of a point-prediction loss function, e.g., the mean absolute error, does not guarantee proper learning of the latent relational information and its associated uncertainty. Conversely, we prove that a suitable loss function on the stochastic model outputs simultaneously grants (i) the unknown adjacency matrix latent distribution and (ii) optimal performance on the prediction task. Finally, we propose a sampling-based method that solves this joint learning task. Empirical results validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

However, existing task offloading methods often fall short of adequately modeling the dependency topology relationships between offloaded tasks, which limits their effectiveness in capturing the complex interdependencies of task features. To address this limitation, we propose a task offloading mechanism based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Our modeling approach takes into account factors such as task characteristics, network conditions, and available resources at the edge, and embeds these captured features into the graph structure. By utilizing GNNs, our mechanism can capture and analyze the intricate relationships between task features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying dependency topology. Through extensive evaluations in heterogeneous networks, our proposed algorithm improves 18.6\%-53.8\% over greedy and approximate algorithms in optimizing system throughput and resource utilization. Our experiments showcase the advantage of considering the intricate interplay of task features using GNN-based modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Insuf...</summary><p>Insufficient completion, there are some errors in the current version</p></details> |

Signal analysis, data statistical learning, and conventional deep learning techniques face constraints under these conditions due to their substantial data requirements and the necessity for transfer learning to accommodate new failure modes. To effectively leverage information and extract the intrinsic characteristics of faults across different domains under limited sample conditions, this paper introduces a fault diagnosis approach employing Multi-Scale Graph Convolution Filtering (MSGCF). MSGCF enhances the traditional Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework by integrating both local and global information fusion modules within the graph convolution filter block. This advancement effectively mitigates the over-smoothing issue associated with excessive layering of graph convolutional layers while preserving a broad receptive field. It also reduces the risk of overfitting in few-shot diagnosis, thereby augmenting the model's representational capacity. Experiments on the University of Paderborn bearing dataset (PU) demonstrate that the MSGCF method proposed herein surpasses alternative approaches in accuracy, thereby offering valuable insights for industrial fault diagnosis in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 63rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

The growing needs to deploy GNNs in high-stakes applications necessitate explainability for users in the decision-making processes. A popular paradigm for the explainability of GNNs is to identify explainable subgraphs by comparing their labels with the ones of original graphs. This task is challenging due to the substantial distributional shift from the original graphs in the training set to the set of explainable subgraphs, which prevents accurate prediction of labels with the subgraphs. To address it, in this paper, we propose a novel method that generates proxy graphs for explainable subgraphs that are in the distribution of training data. We introduce a parametric method that employs graph generators to produce proxy graphs. A new training objective based on information theory is designed to ensure that proxy graphs not only adhere to the distribution of training data but also preserve explanatory factors. Such generated proxy graphs can be reliably used to approximate the predictions of the labels of explainable subgraphs. Empirical evaluations across various datasets demonstrate our method achieves more accurate explanations for GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Most existing methods for heterogeneous graphs mainly learn node embeddings by stacking multiple convolutional or attentional layers, which can be considered as capturing the high-order information from node-level aspect. However, different types of nodes in heterogeneous graphs have diverse features, it is also necessary to capture interactions among node features, namely the high-order information from feature-level aspect. In addition, most methods first align node features by mapping them into one same low-dimensional space, while they may lose some type information of nodes in this way. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph Cascade Attention Network (HetCAN) composed of multiple cascade blocks. Each cascade block includes two components, the type-aware encoder and the dimension-aware encoder. Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and aims to make full use of graph heterogeneity. The dimension-aware encoder is able to learn the feature-level high-order information by capturing the interactions among node features. With the assistance of these components, HetCAN can comprehensively encode information of node features, graph heterogeneity and graph structure in node embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HetCAN over advanced competitors and also exhibit its efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |

However, without any form of uncertainty quantification, it can be difficult to trust such models in high-risk scenarios. Conformal prediction aims to address this problem, however, an assumption of exchangeability is required for its validity which has limited its applicability to static graphs and transductive regimes. We propose to use unfolding, which allows any existing static GNN to output a dynamic graph embedding with exchangeability properties. Using this, we extend the validity of conformal prediction to dynamic GNNs in both transductive and semi-inductive regimes. We provide a theoretical guarantee of valid conformal prediction in these cases and demonstrate the empirical validity, as well as the performance gains, of unfolded GNNs against standard GNN architectures on both simulated and real datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

It aims to break down complex user requests into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests. In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them. Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design. Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs). This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance. Additionally, our approach complements prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques, with performance further enhanced by improved prompts or a fine-tuned model.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates a new research task: self-interpretable GNNs for CTDGs. We aim to predict future links within the dynamic graph while simultaneously providing causal explanations for these predictions. There are two key challenges: (1) capturing the underlying structural and temporal information that remains consistent across both independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and (2) efficiently generating high-quality link prediction results and explanations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel causal inference model, namely the Independent and Confounded Causal Model (ICCM). ICCM is then integrated into a deep learning architecture that considers both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods across link prediction accuracy, explanation quality, and robustness to shortcut features.

The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK.

As a lightweight alternative, Hyper-Dimensional Computing (HDC), which leverages high-dimensional vectors for data encoding and processing, offers a more efficient solution by addressing computational bottleneck. However, current HDC methods primarily focus on static graphs and neglect to effectively capture node attributes and structural information, which leads to poor accuracy. In this work, we propose CiliaGraph, an enhanced expressive yet ultra-lightweight HDC model for graph classification. This model introduces a novel node encoding strategy that preserves relative distance isomorphism for accurate node connection representation. In addition, node distances are utilized as edge weights for information aggregation, and the encoded node attributes and structural information are concatenated to obtain a comprehensive graph representation. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between orthogonality and dimensionality to reduce the dimensions, thereby further enhancing computational efficiency. Compared to the SOTA GNNs, extensive experiments show that CiliaGraph reduces memory usage and accelerates training speed by an average of 292 times(up to 2341 times) and 103 times(up to 313 times) respectively while maintaining comparable accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Secondly, we have proposed a novel graph learning strategy to concurrently learn both static and dynamic spatial associations between different traffic nodes in road networks. Meanwhile, in order to enhance the learning ability of time-varying graphs, a coupled graph learning mechanism was designed to couple the graphs learned at each time step. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method HTVGNN was demonstrated with four real data sets. Simulation results revealed that HTVGNN achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to the state of the art space-time graph neural network models. Additionally, the ablation experiment verifies that the coupled graph learning mechanism can effectively improve the long-term prediction performance of HTVGNN.</p></details> | 16 pages 7 figures |

However, current methods often rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), leading to increased runtimes and memory use. Moreover, these methods typically operate within 1-hop neighborhoods, exacerbating the reduction of the receptive field. Causal Graph Processes (CGPs) offer an alternative, using graph filters instead of MLP layers to reduce parameters and minimize memory consumption. This paper introduces the Causal Graph Process Neural Network (CGProNet), a non-linear model combining CGPs and GNNs for spatiotemporal forecasting. CGProNet employs higher-order graph filters, optimizing the model with fewer parameters, reducing memory usage, and improving runtime efficiency.

| **[Continuous Product Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18877v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing multidomain data defined on multiple graphs holds significant potential in various practical applications in computer science. However, current methods are mostly limited to discrete graph filtering operations. Tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (TPDEGs) provide a principled framework for modeling structured data across multiple interacting graphs, addressing the limitations of the existing discrete methodologies. In this paper, we introduce Continuous Product Graph Neural Networks (CITRUS) that emerge as a natural solution to the TPDEG. CITRUS leverages the separability of continuous heat kernels from Cartesian graph products to efficiently implement graph spectral decomposition. We conduct thorough theoretical analyses of the stability and over-smoothing properties of CITRUS in response to domain-specific graph perturbations and graph spectra effects on the performance. We evaluate CITRUS on well-known traffic and weather spatiotemporal forecasting datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Node Injection Attack Based on Label Propagation Against Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18824v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved remarkable success in various graph learning tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. The key to the success of GNN lies in its effective structure information representation through neighboring aggregation. However, the attacker can easily perturb the aggregation process through injecting fake nodes, which reveals that GNN is vulnerable to the graph injection attack. Existing graph injection attack methods primarily focus on damaging the classical feature aggregation process while overlooking the neighborhood aggregation process via label propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose the label-propagation-based global injection attack (LPGIA) which conducts the graph injection attack on the node classification task. Specifically, we analyze the aggregation process from the perspective of label propagation and transform the graph injection attack problem into a global injection label specificity attack problem. To solve this problem, LPGIA utilizes a label propagation-based strategy to optimize the combinations of the nodes connected to the injected node. Then, LPGIA leverages the feature mapping to generate malicious features for injected nodes. In extensive experiments against representative GNNs, LPGIA outperforms the previous best-performing injection attack method in various datasets, demonstrating its superiority and transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TCSS;DOI:10.1109/TCSS.2024.3395794</p></details> |
| **[A Graph is Worth $K$ Words: Euclideanizing Graph using Pure Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02464v3)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can we model Non-Euclidean graphs as pure language or even Euclidean vectors while retaining their inherent information? The Non-Euclidean property have posed a long term challenge in graph modeling. Despite recent graph neural networks and graph transformers efforts encoding graphs as Euclidean vectors, recovering the original graph from vectors remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce GraphsGPT, featuring an Graph2Seq encoder that transforms Non-Euclidean graphs into learnable Graph Words in the Euclidean space, along with a GraphGPT decoder that reconstructs the original graph from Graph Words to ensure information equivalence. We pretrain GraphsGPT on $100$M molecules and yield some interesting findings: (1) The pretrained Graph2Seq excels in graph representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on $8/9$ graph classification and regression tasks. (2) The pretrained GraphGPT serves as a strong graph generator, demonstrated by its strong ability to perform both few-shot and conditional graph generation. (3) Graph2Seq+GraphGPT enables effective graph mixup in the Euclidean space, overcoming previously known Non-Euclidean challenges. (4) The edge-centric pretraining framework GraphsGPT demonstrates its efficacy in graph domain tasks, excelling in both representation and generation.

As the interpretation of GNNs becomes increasingly important, the demand for robust baselines and expansive graph datasets is accentuated, particularly in the context of Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN). Addressing this, we introduce SynHING, a novel framework for Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network Generation aimed at enhancing graph learning and explanation. SynHING systematically identifies major motifs in a target HIN and employs a bottom-up generation process with intra-cluster and inter-cluster merge modules. This process, supplemented by post-pruning techniques, ensures the synthetic HIN closely mirrors the original graph's structural and statistical properties. Crucially, SynHING provides ground-truth motifs for evaluating GNN explainer models, setting a new standard for explainable, synthetic HIN generation and contributing to the advancement of interpretable machine learning in complex networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update figures, tables, and content</p></details> |
| **[DeepHGNN: Study of Graph Neural Network based Forecasting Methods for Hierarchically Related Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18693v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained significant traction in the forecasting domain, especially for their capacity to simultaneously account for intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series relationships. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical GNN (DeepHGNN) framework, explicitly designed for forecasting in complex hierarchical structures. The uniqueness of DeepHGNN lies in its innovative graph-based hierarchical interpolation and an end-to-end reconciliation mechanism. This approach ensures forecast accuracy and coherence across various hierarchical levels while sharing signals across them, addressing a key challenge in hierarchical forecasting. A critical insight in hierarchical time series is the variance in forecastability across levels, with upper levels typically presenting more predictable components. DeepHGNN capitalizes on this insight by pooling and leveraging knowledge from all hierarchy levels, thereby enhancing the overall forecast accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation set against several state-of-the-art models confirm the superior performance of DeepHGNN. This research not only demonstrates DeepHGNN's effectiveness in achieving significantly improved forecast accuracy but also contributes to the understanding of graph-based methods in hierarchical time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-based Feature Augmentation of Graph Neural Networks for Variant Emergence Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03390v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major driver of new surges has been the emergence of new variants. When a new variant emerges in one or more countries, other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The impact of the new variant and the timings of epidemic peaks in a country highly depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest and has a significant prevalence. Can we predict when a variant existing elsewhere will arrive in a given region? To address this question, we propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach. First, we derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across pairs of regions (countries) that apply to a large class of epidemic models. The dynamics motivate the introduction of certain features in the GNN. We demonstrate that our proposed dynamics-informed GNN outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). To advance research in this area, we introduce a benchmarking tool to assess a user-defined model's prediction performance across 87 countries and 36 variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-CoRP: Differentiable Connectivity Refinement for Functional Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18658v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain network is an important tool for understanding the brain, offering insights for scientific research and clinical diagnosis. Existing models for brain networks typically primarily focus on brain regions or overlook the complexity of brain connectivities. MRI-derived brain network data is commonly susceptible to connectivity noise, underscoring the necessity of incorporating connectivities into the modeling of brain networks. To address this gap, we introduce a differentiable module for refining brain connectivity. We develop the multivariate optimization based on information bottleneck theory to address the complexity of the brain network and filter noisy or redundant connections. Also, our method functions as a flexible plugin that is adaptable to most graph neural networks. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of various baseline models and outperform other state-of-the-art methods, indicating the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method in refining brain network connectivity. The code will be released for public availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on the attention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist in leveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper link predictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. We will implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcase benchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, not published nor submitted yet</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Text-attributed Graphs: Automatic Relation Decomposition via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18581v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have significantly improved the quality of node features by using the textual modeling capabilities of language models. Despite this success, utilizing text attributes to enhance the predefined graph structure remains largely unexplored. Our extensive analysis reveals that conventional edges on TAGs, treated as a single relation (e.g., hyperlinks) in previous literature, actually encompass mixed semantics (e.g., "advised by" and "participates in"). This simplification hinders the representation learning process of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on downstream tasks, even when integrated with advanced node features. In contrast, we discover that decomposing these edges into distinct semantic relations significantly enhances the performance of GNNs. Despite this, manually identifying and labeling of edges to corresponding semantic relations is labor-intensive, often requiring domain expertise. To this end, we introduce RoSE (Relation-oriented Semantic Edge-decomposition), a novel framework that leverages the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose the graph structure by analyzing raw text attributes - in a fully automated manner. RoSE operates in two stages: (1) identifying meaningful relations using an LLM-based generator and discriminator, and (2) categorizing each edge into corresponding relations by analyzing textual contents associated with connected nodes via an LLM-based decomposer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model-agnostic framework significantly enhances node classification performance across various datasets, with improvements of up to 16% on the Wisconsin dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Transformer Reasoning Capabilities via Graph Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18512v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Which transformer scaling regimes are able to perfectly solve different classes of algorithmic problems? While tremendous empirical advances have been attained by transformer-based neural networks, a theoretical understanding of their algorithmic reasoning capabilities in realistic parameter regimes is lacking. We investigate this question in terms of the network's depth, width, and number of extra tokens for algorithm execution. Our novel representational hierarchy separates 9 algorithmic reasoning problems into classes solvable by transformers in different realistic parameter scaling regimes. We prove that logarithmic depth is necessary and sufficient for tasks like graph connectivity, while single-layer transformers with small embedding dimensions can solve contextual retrieval tasks. We also support our theoretical analysis with ample empirical evidence using the GraphQA benchmark. These results show that transformers excel at many graph reasoning tasks, even outperforming specialized graph neural networks.</p></details> | 43 pages, 8 figures |

This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors. The proposed approach highlights the importance of structured inductive biases for gaining improved generalization in complex biological prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, ICML Conference Workshop 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.18610</p></details> |
