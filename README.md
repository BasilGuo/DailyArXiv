| **[A Detailed Measurement View on IPv6 Scanners and Their Adaption to BGP Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20383v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scanners are daily visitors of public IPv4 hosts. Scanning IPv6 nodes successfully is still a challenge, which an increasing crowd of actors tries to master. In this paper, we analyze current IPv6 scanning under various network conditions. We observe scanner behavior during eleven months in four network telescopes, one of which is periodically reconfigured by changing BGP announcements. We analyze and classify the observed scanners w.r.t. their temporal behavior, their target, and network selection strategy, as well as their individual tools, fingerprints, and correlations across categories. We find that silent subnets of larger prefixes remain invisible, whereas BGP prefix announcements quickly attract attention by scanners. Based on our findings, we derive operational guidance on how to deploy network telescopes to increase visibility of IPv6 scanners.</p></details> |  |

BGP hijacks still occurr daily. While full deployment of Route Origin Validation (ROV) is ongoing, attackers have already adapted, launching post-ROV attacks such as forged-origin hijacks. To detect these, recent approaches like DFOH [Holterbach et al., USENIX NSDI '24] and BEAM [Chen et al., USENIX Security '24] apply machine learning (ML) to analyze data from globally distributed BGP monitors, assuming anomalies will stand out against historical patterns. However, this assumption overlooks a key threat: BGP monitors themselves can be misled by adversaries injecting bogus routes. This paper shows that state-of-the-art hijack detection systems like DFOH and BEAM are vulnerable to data poisoning. Using large-scale BGP simulations, we show that attackers can evade detection with just a handful of crafted announcements beyond the actual hijack. These announcements are indeed sufficient to corrupt the knowledge base used by ML-based defenses and distort the metrics they rely on. Our results highlight a worrying weakness of relying solely on public BGP data.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Blind Spot of BGP Anomaly Detection: Why LSTM Autoencoders Fail on Real-World Outages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17821v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significant potential to make the Internet's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) secure by detecting anomalous routing activity. However, all but a few of these approaches rely on the implicit assumption that anomalies manifest as noisy, high-complexity outliers from some normal baseline. This work challenges this assumption by investigating if a best-in-class detection model built on this assumption can effectively deal with real-world security events' diverse signatures. We employ an LSTM-based autoencoder, a classical example of a reconstruction-based anomaly detector, as our test vehicle. We then contrast this model with a representative sampling of historical BGP anomalies, including the Slammer worm and the Moscow blackout, and with a simulated 'BGP storm' designed as a positive control. Our experience unveils a blind spot of our model: the model easily identifies the synthetic anomaly of high complexity but invariably fails to identify real-world events that manifest in the form of a "signal loss" (e.g., Slammer, Moscow Blackout) or "low-deviation" (e.g., WannaCry) signature. We demonstrate that the model mistakenly recognizes the abrupt cut-off of BGP updates during catastrophic failures as a signal of extreme stability, leading to reconstruction errors of virtually zero and total failure to detect. We conclude that the characterization of BGP anomalies as high-reconstruction-error events alone is a weak and dangerous oversimplification. Our research provides the data-driven case for why hybrid, multi-modal detection systems capable of identifying both high-complexity and signal-loss signatures are required to enable end-to-end BGP security.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEAR: BGP Event Analysis and Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04514v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy, outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering valuable operational insights for network management.</p></details> |  |

| **[Global BGP Attacks that Evade Route Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09622v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the deployment of comprehensive Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) security measures is still in progress, BGP monitoring continues to play a critical role in protecting the Internet from routing attacks. Fundamentally, monitoring involves observing BGP feeds to detect suspicious announcements and taking defensive action. However, BGP monitoring relies on seeing the malicious BGP announcement in the first place! In this paper, we develop a novel attack that can hide itself from all state-of-the-art BGP monitoring systems we tested while affecting the entire Internet. The attack involves launching a sub-prefix hijack with the RFC-specified NO_EXPORT community attached to prevent networks with the malicious route installed from sending the route to BGP monitoring systems. We study the viability of this attack at four tier-1 networks and find all networks we studied were vulnerable to the attack. Finally, we propose a mitigation that significantly improves the robustness of the BGP monitoring ecosystem. Our paper aims to raise awareness of this issue and offer guidance to providers to protect against such attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[MAD-MulW: A Multi-Window Anomaly Detection Framework for BGP Security Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11225v1)** | 2023-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, various international security events have occurred frequently and interacted between real society and cyberspace. Traditional traffic monitoring mainly focuses on the local anomalous status of events due to a large amount of data. BGP-based event monitoring makes it possible to perform differential analysis of international events. For many existing traffic anomaly detection methods, we have observed that the window-based noise reduction strategy effectively improves the success rate of time series anomaly detection. Motivated by this observation, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model, MAD-MulW, which incorporates a multi-window serial framework. Firstly, we design the W-GAT module to adaptively update the sample weights within the window and retain the updated information of the trailing sample, which not only reduces the outlier samples' noise but also avoids the space consumption of data scale expansion. Then, the W-LAT module based on predictive reconstruction both captures the trend of sample fluctuations over a certain period of time and increases the interclass variation through the reconstruction of the predictive sample. Our model has been experimentally validated on multiple BGP anomalous events with an average F1 score of over 90\%, which demonstrates the significant improvement effect of the stage windows and adaptive strategy on the efficiency and stability of the timing model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[BGP Typo: A Longitudinal Study and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00335v1)** | 2023-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP is the protocol that keeps Internet connected. Operators use it by announcing Address Prefixes (APs), namely IP address blocks, that they own or that they agree to serve as transit for. BGP enables ISPs to devise complex policies to control what AP announcements to accept (import policy), the route selection, and what AP to announce and to whom (export policy). In addition, BGP is also used to coarse traffic engineering for incoming traffic via the prepend mechanism. However, there are no wide-spread good tools for managing BGP and much of the complex configuration is done by home-brewed scripts or simply by manually configuring router with bare-bone terminal interface. This process generates many configuration mistakes. In this study, we examine typos that propagates in BGP announcements and can be found in many of the public databases. We classify them and quantify their presence, and surprisingly found tens of ASNs and hundreds of APs affected by typos on any given time. In addition, we suggest a simple algorithm that can detect (and clean) most of them with almost no false positives.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIGHTYEAR: Using Modularity to Scale BGP Control Plane Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09635v2)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current network control plane verification tools cannot scale to large networks, because of the complexity of jointly reasoning about the behaviors of all nodes in the network. In this paper we present a modular approach to control plane verification, whereby end-to-end network properties are verified via a set of purely local checks on individual nodes and edges. The approach targets the verification of safety properties for BGP configurations and provides guarantees in the face of both arbitrary external route announcements from neighbors and arbitrary node/link failures. We have proven the approach correct and also implemented it in a tool called Lightyear. Experimental results show that Lightyear scales dramatically better than prior control plane verifiers. Further, we have used Lightyear to verify three properties of the wide area network of a major cloud provider, containing hundreds of routers and tens of thousands of edges. To our knowledge no prior tool has been demonstrated to provide such guarantees at that scale. Finally, in addition to the scaling benefits, our modular approach to verification makes it easy to localize the causes of configuration errors and to support incremental re-verification as configurations are updated.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (+ 2 pages references), 3 figures, Accepted at SIGCOMM '23</p></details> |
| **[Live Long and Prosper:Analyzing Long-Lived MOAS Prefixes in BGP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08490v1)** | 2023-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP exchanges reachability information in the form of prefixes, which are usually originated by a single Autonomous System (AS). If multiple ASes originate the same prefix, this is referred to as a Multiple Origin ASes (MOAS) prefix. One reason for MOAS prefixes are BGP prefix hijacks, which are mostly short-lived and have been studied extensively in the past years. In contrast to short-lived MOAS, long-lived MOAS have remained largely understudied. In this paper, we focus on long-lived MOAS prefixes and perform an in-depth study over six years. We identify around 24k long-lived MOAS prefixes in IPv4 and 1.4k in IPv6 being announced in January 2023. By analyzing the RPKI status we find that more than 40% of MOAS prefixes have all origins registered correctly, with only a minority of MOAS having invalid origins. Moreover, we find that the most prominent CIDR size of MOAS prefixes is /24 for IPv4 and /48 for IPv6, suggesting their use for fine-grained traffic steering. We attribute a considerable number of MOAS prefixes to mergers and acquisitions of companies. Additionally, more than 90% of MOAS prefixes are originated by two origin ASes, with the majority of detected origin AS relations being customer-provider. Finally, we identify that the majority of MOAS users are IT companies, and just 0.9% of IPv4 MOAS and 6.3% of IPv6 MOAS prefixes are used for anycast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oscilloscope: Detecting BGP Hijacks in the Data Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12843v1)** | 2023-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lack of security of the Internet routing protocol (BGP) has allowed attackers to divert Internet traffic and consequently perpetrate service disruptions, monetary frauds, and even citizen surveillance for decades. State-of-the-art defenses rely on geo-distributed BGP monitors to detect rogue BGP announcements. As we show, though, attackers can easily evade detection by engineering their announcements. This paper presents Oscilloscope, an approach to accurately detect BGP hijacks by relying on real-time traffic analysis. As hijacks inevitably change the characteristics of the diverted traffic, the key idea is to track these changes in real time and flag them. The main challenge is that "normal" Internet events (e.g., network reconfigurations, link failures, load balancing) also change the underlying traffic characteristics - and they are way more frequent than hijacks. Naive traffic analyses would hence lead to too many false positives. We observe that hijacks typically target a subset of the prefixes announced by Internet service providers and only divert a subset of their traffic. In contrast, normal events lead to more uniform changes across prefixes and traffic. Oscilloscope uses this observation to filter out non-hijack events by checking whether they affect multiple related prefixes or not. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Oscilloscope quickly and accurately detects hijacks in realistic traffic traces containing hundreds of events.</p></details> |  |
| **[BGP-Multipath Routing in the Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10938v2)** | 2022-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP-Multipath (BGP-M) is a multipath routing technique for load balancing. Distinct from other techniques deployed at a router inside an Autonomous System (AS), BGP-M is deployed at a border router that has installed multiple inter-domain border links to a neighbour AS. It uses the equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) function of a border router to share traffic to a destination prefix on different border links. Despite recent research interests in multipath routing, there is little study on BGP-M. Here we provide the first measurement and a comprehensive analysis of BGP-M routing in the Internet. We extracted information on BGP-M from query data collected from Looking Glass (LG) servers. We revealed that BGP-M has already been extensively deployed and used in the Internet. A particular example is Hurricane Electric (AS6939), a Tier-1 network operator, which has implemented >1,000 cases of BGP-M at 69 of its border routers to prefixes in 611 of its neighbour ASes, including many hyper-giant ASes and large content providers, on both IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. We examined the distribution and operation of BGP-M. We also ran traceroute using RIPE Atlas to infer the routing paths, the schemes of traffic allocation, and the delay on border links. This study provided the state-of-the-art knowledge on BGP-M with novel insights into the unique features and the distinct advantages of BGP-M as an effective and readily available technique for load balancing.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-View Framework for BGP Anomaly Detection via Graph Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12793v1)** | 2021-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the default protocol for exchanging routing reachability information on the Internet, the abnormal behavior in traffic of Border Gateway Protocols (BGP) is closely related to Internet anomaly events. The BGP anomalous detection model ensures stable routing services on the Internet through its real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities. Previous studies either focused on the feature selection problem or the memory characteristic in data, while ignoring the relationship between features and the precise time correlation in feature (whether it's long or short term dependence). In this paper, we propose a multi-view model for capturing anomalous behaviors from BGP update traffic, in which Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method is used to reduce the noise in the original time-series data, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to discover feature relationships and time correlations in feature, respectively. Our results outperform the state-of-the-art methods at the anomaly detection task, with the average F1 score up to 96.3% and 93.2% on the balanced and imbalanced datasets respectively. Meanwhile, our model can be extended to classify multiple anomalous and to detect unknown events.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

| **[Latency-Aware Inter-domain Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13019v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite efforts from cloud and content providers to lower latency to acceptable levels for current and future services (e.g., augmented reality or cloud gaming), there are still opportunities for improvement. A major reason that traffic engineering efforts are challenged to lower latency is that the Internet's inter-domain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol, is oblivious to any performance metric, and circuitous routing is still pervasive. In this work, we propose two implementation modifications that networks can leverage to make BGP latency-aware and reduce excessive latency inflation. These proposals, latency-proportional AS prepending and local preference neutralization, show promise towards providing a method for propagating abstract latency information with a reasonable increase in routing overhead.</p></details> |  |

| **[Secure Inter-domain Routing and Forwarding via Verifiable Forwarding Commitments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13271v2)** | 2023-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet inter-domain routing system is vulnerable. On the control plane, the de facto Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) does not have built-in mechanisms to authenticate routing announcements, so an adversary can announce virtually arbitrary paths to hijack network traffic; on the data plane, it is difficult to ensure that actual forwarding path complies with the control plane decisions. The community has proposed significant research to secure the routing system. Yet, existing secure BGP protocols (e.g., BGPsec) are not incrementally deployable, and existing path authorization protocols are not compatible with the current Internet routing infrastructure. In this paper, we propose FC-BGP, the first secure Internet inter-domain routing system that can simultaneously authenticate BGP announcements and validate data plane forwarding in an efficient and incrementally-deployable manner. FC-BGP is built upon a novel primitive, name Forwarding Commitment, to certify an AS's routing intent on its directly connected hops. We analyze the security benefits of FC-BGP in the Internet at different deployment rates. Further, we implement a prototype of FC-BGP and extensively evaluate it over a large-scale overlay network with 100 virtual machines deployed globally. The results demonstrate that FC-BGP saves roughly 55% of the overhead required to validate BGP announcements compared with BGPsec, and meanwhile FC-BGP introduces a small overhead for building a globally-consistent view on the desirable forwarding paths.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Creating a Secure Underlay for the Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06879v2)** | 2022-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversaries can exploit inter-domain routing vulnerabilities to intercept communication and compromise the security of critical Internet applications. Meanwhile the deployment of secure routing solutions such as Border Gateway Protocol Security (BGPsec) and Scalability, Control and Isolation On Next-generation networks (SCION) are still limited. How can we leverage emerging secure routing backbones and extend their security properties to the broader Internet? We design and deploy an architecture to bootstrap secure routing. Our key insight is to abstract the secure routing backbone as a virtual Autonomous System (AS), called Secure Backbone AS (SBAS). While SBAS appears as one AS to the Internet, it is a federated network where routes are exchanged between participants using a secure backbone. SBAS makes BGP announcements for its customers' IP prefixes at multiple locations (referred to as Points of Presence or PoPs) allowing traffic from non-participating hosts to be routed to a nearby SBAS PoP (where it is then routed over the secure backbone to the true prefix owner). In this manner, we are the first to integrate a federated secure non-BGP routing backbone with the BGP-speaking Internet. We present a real-world deployment of our architecture that uses SCIONLab to emulate the secure backbone and the PEERING framework to make BGP announcements to the Internet. A combination of real-world attacks and Internet-scale simulations shows that SBAS substantially reduces the threat of routing attacks. Finally, we survey network operators to better understand optimal governance and incentive models.</p></details> | Usenix Security 2022 |
| **[Cutting Through the Noise to Infer Autonomous System Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07328v1)** | 2022-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a distributed protocol that manages interdomain routing without requiring a centralized record of which autonomous systems (ASes) connect to which others. Many methods have been devised to infer the AS topology from publicly available BGP data, but none provide a general way to handle the fact that the data are notoriously incomplete and subject to error. This paper describes a method for reliably inferring AS-level connectivity in the presence of measurement error using Bayesian statistical inference acting on BGP routing tables from multiple vantage points. We employ a novel approach for counting AS adjacency observations in the AS-PATH attribute data from public route collectors, along with a Bayesian algorithm to generate a statistical estimate of the AS-level network. Our approach also gives us a way to evaluate the accuracy of existing reconstruction methods and to identify advantageous locations for new route collectors or vantage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[BlockJack: Towards Improved Prevention of IP Prefix Hijacking Attacks in Inter-Domain Routing Via Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07063v1)** | 2021-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose BlockJack, a system based on a distributed and tamper-proof consortium Blockchain that aims at blocking IP prefix hijacking in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). In essence, BlockJack provides synchronization among BlockChain and BGP network through interfaces ensuring operational independence and this approach preserving the legacy system and accommodates the impact of a race condition if the Blockchain process exceeds the BGP update interval. BlockJack is also resilient to dynamic routing path changes during the occurrence of the IP prefix hijacking in the routing tables. We implement BlockJack using Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain and Quagga software package and we perform initial sets of experiments to evaluate its efficacy. We evaluate the performance and resilience of BlockJack in various attack scenarios including single path attacks, multiple path attacks, and attacks from random sources in the random network topology. The Evaluation results show that BlockJack is able to handle multiple attacks caused by AS paths changes during a BGP prefix hijacking. In experiment settings with 50 random routers, BlockJack takes on average 0.08 seconds (with a standard deviation of 0.04 seconds) to block BGP prefix hijacking attacks. The test result showing that BlockJack conservative approach feasible to handle the IP Prefix hijacking in the Border Gateway Protocol.</p></details> |  |
| **[APVAS: Reducing Memory Size of AS\_PATH Validation by Using Aggregate Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13346v1)** | 2020-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The \textit{BGPsec} protocol, which is an extension of the border gateway protocol (BGP), uses digital signatures to guarantee the validity of routing information. However, BGPsec's use of digital signatures in routing information causes a lack of memory in BGP routers and therefore creates a gaping security hole in today's Internet. This problem hinders the practical realization and implementation of BGPsec. In this paper, we present APVAS (AS path validation based on aggregate signatures), a new validation method that reduces memory consumption of BGPsec when validating paths in routing information. To do this, APVAS relies on a novel aggregate signature scheme that compresses individually generated signatures into a single signature in two ways, i.e., in sequential and interactive fashions. Furthermore, we implement a prototype of APVAS on \textit{BIRD Internet Routing Daemon} and demonstrate its efficiency on actual BGP connections. Our results show that APVAS can reduce memory consumption by 80\% in comparison with the conventional BGPsec.</p></details> |  |

However, all but a few of these approaches rely on the implicit assumption that anomalies manifest as noisy, high-complexity outliers from some normal baseline. This work challenges this assumption by investigating if a best-in-class detection model built on this assumption can effectively deal with real-world security events' diverse signatures. We employ an LSTM-based autoencoder, a classical example of a reconstruction-based anomaly detector, as our test vehicle. We then contrast this model with a representative sampling of historical BGP anomalies, including the Slammer worm and the Moscow blackout, and with a simulated 'BGP storm' designed as a positive control. Our experience unveils a blind spot of our model: the model easily identifies the synthetic anomaly of high complexity but invariably fails to identify real-world events that manifest in the form of a "signal loss" (e.g., Slammer, Moscow Blackout) or "low-deviation" (e.g., WannaCry) signature. We demonstrate that the model mistakenly recognizes the abrupt cut-off of BGP updates during catastrophic failures as a signal of extreme stability, leading to reconstruction errors of virtually zero and total failure to detect. We conclude that the characterization of BGP anomalies as high-reconstruction-error events alone is a weak and dangerous oversimplification. Our research provides the data-driven case for why hybrid, multi-modal detection systems capable of identifying both high-complexity and signal-loss signatures are required to enable end-to-end BGP security.</p></details> |  |

Fundamentally, monitoring involves observing BGP feeds to detect suspicious announcements and taking defensive action. However, BGP monitoring relies on seeing the malicious BGP announcement in the first place! In this paper, we develop a novel attack that can hide itself from all state-of-the-art BGP monitoring systems we tested while affecting the entire Internet. The attack involves launching a sub-prefix hijack with the RFC-specified NO_EXPORT community attached to prevent networks with the malicious route installed from sending the route to BGP monitoring systems. We study the viability of this attack at four tier-1 networks and find all networks we studied were vulnerable to the attack. Finally, we propose a mitigation that significantly improves the robustness of the BGP monitoring ecosystem. Our paper aims to raise awareness of this issue and offer guidance to providers to protect against such attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Traditional traffic monitoring mainly focuses on the local anomalous status of events due to a large amount of data. BGP-based event monitoring makes it possible to perform differential analysis of international events. For many existing traffic anomaly detection methods, we have observed that the window-based noise reduction strategy effectively improves the success rate of time series anomaly detection. Motivated by this observation, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model, MAD-MulW, which incorporates a multi-window serial framework. Firstly, we design the W-GAT module to adaptively update the sample weights within the window and retain the updated information of the trailing sample, which not only reduces the outlier samples' noise but also avoids the space consumption of data scale expansion. Then, the W-LAT module based on predictive reconstruction both captures the trend of sample fluctuations over a certain period of time and increases the interclass variation through the reconstruction of the predictive sample. Our model has been experimentally validated on multiple BGP anomalous events with an average F1 score of over 90\%, which demonstrates the significant improvement effect of the stage windows and adaptive strategy on the efficiency and stability of the timing model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Securing BGP has been a long-term objective of several research and industrial efforts during the last decades, that have culminated in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for the cryptographic verification of prefix-to-AS assignments. However, there is still no widely adopted solution for securing IP prefixes and the (AS-)paths leading to them; approaches such as BGPsec have seen minuscule deployment. In this work, we design and implement a Blockchain-based system that (i) can be used to validate both of these resource types, (ii) can work passively and does not require any changes in the inter-domain routing system (BGP, RPKI), and (iii) can be combined with currently available systems for the detection and mitigation of routing attacks. We present early results and insights w.r.t. scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>draft...</summary><p>draft report on BGP blockchain PoC</p></details> |
| **[An SDN-based approach to enhance BGP security](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06924v2)** | 2016-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP is vulnerable to a series of attacks. Many solutions have been proposed in the past two decades, but the most effective remain largely undeployed. This is due to three fundamental reasons: the solutions are too computationally expensive for current routers, they require changes to BGP, and/or they do not give the right incentives to promote deployment. In this abstract we propose a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture to secure BGP routing. Our solution, BGPSecX, targets an IXP and it includes techniques to allow different IXPs to collaborate. With SDN we remove the computational burden from routers and do not make changes to BGP. Targeting IXPs and promoting inter-IXP collaboration enables the creation of incentives to foster adoption of BGP security services.</p></details> |  |
| **[BGP Security in Partial Deployment: Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2690v1)** | 2013-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i.e., S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in "partial deployment" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on BGP Issues and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4815v1)** | 2009-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP is the de facto protocol used for inter-autonomous system routing in the Internet. Generally speaking, BGP has been proven to be secure, efficient, scalable, and robust. However, with the rapid evolving of the Internet in the past few decades, there are increasing concerns about BGS's ability to meet the needs of the Internet routing. There are two major limitations of BGP which are its failure to address several key security issues, and some operational related problems. The design and ubiquity of BGP have complicated past efforts at securing inter-domain routing. This paper surveys the past work related to BGP security and operational issues. We explore the limitations and advantages of proposed solutions in these two limitations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pruning the Tree: Rethinking RPKI Architecture From The Ground Up](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01465v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a critical security mechanism for BGP, but the complexity of its architecture is a growing concern as its adoption scales. Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such as X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols, which introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and inefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design choices, although based on established standards, create significant performance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder scalability for wide-scale Internet deployment. In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of complexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world impact. We show that over 70\% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is spent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it unnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI), a backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while substantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and ROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose encodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more efficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of iRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time, 18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory footprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to at least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the feasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in constrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without impacting existing operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at NDSS2026</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Identify Conflicts in RPKI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03378v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long history of misconfigurations and errors in RPKI indicates that they cannot be easily avoided and will most probably persist also in the future. These errors create conflicts between BGP announcements and their covering ROAs, causing the RPKI validation to result in status invalid. Networks that enforce RPKI filtering with Route Origin Validation (ROV) would block such conflicting BGP announcements and as a result lose traffic from the corresponding origins. Since the business incentives of networks are tightly coupled with the traffic they relay, filtering legitimate traffic leads to a loss of revenue, reducing the motivation to filter invalid announcements with ROV. In this work, we introduce a new mechanism, LOV, designed for whitelisting benign conflicts on an Internet scale. The resulting whitelist is made available to RPKI supporting ASes to avoid filtering RPKI-invalid but benign routes. Saving legitimate traffic resolves one main obstacle towards RPKI deployment. We measure live BGP updates using LOV during a period of half a year and whitelist 52,846 routes with benign origin errors.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have exploited routing attacks to observe Tor traffic and deanonymize Tor users. Subsequently, location-aware relay selection algorithms have been proposed to defend against such attacks on Tor. However, location-aware relay selection algorithms are known to be vulnerable to information leakage on client locations and guard placement attacks. Can we design a new location-unaware approach to relay selection while achieving the similar goal of defending against routing attacks? Towards this end, we leverage the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) in designing new guard relay selection algorithms. We develop a lightweight Discount Selection algorithm by only incorporating Route Origin Authorization (ROA) information, and a more secure Matching Selection algorithm by incorporating both ROA and Route Origin Validation (ROV) information. Our evaluation results show an increase in the number of ROA-ROV matched client-relay pairs using our Matching Selection algorithm, reaching 48.47% with minimal performance overhead through custom Shadow simulations and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures, for data and intermediate results see: https://torstudy.cs.virginia.edu/ , to be published in Issue 2 of PoPETs 2025</p></details> |

We discuss the unique impact of this RCE on networks that use RPKI, illustrating that RCE vulnerabilities are especially severe in the context of RPKI. The design of RPKI makes RCE easy to exploit on a large scale, allows compromise of RPKI validation integrity, and enables a powerful vector for additional attacks on other critical components of the network, like the border routers. We analyze the vulnerability exposing to this RCE and identify indications that the discovered vulnerability could constitute an intentional backdoor to compromise systems running the software over a benign coding mistake.

| **[RPKI: Not Perfect But Good Enough](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14518v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) protocol was standardized to add cryptographic security to Internet routing. With over 50% of Internet resources protected with RPKI today, the protocol already impacts significant parts of Internet traffic. In addition to its growing adoption, there is also increasing political interest in RPKI. The White House indicated in its Roadmap to Enhance Internet Routing Security, on 4 September 2024, that RPKI is a mature and readily available technology for securing inter-domain routing. The Roadmap attributes the main obstacles towards wide adoption of RPKI to a lack of understanding, lack of prioritization, and administrative barriers. This work presents the first comprehensive study of the maturity of RPKI as a viable production-grade technology. We find that current RPKI implementations still lack production-grade resilience and are plagued by software vulnerabilities, inconsistent specifications, and operational challenges, raising significant security concerns. The deployments lack experience with full-fledged strict RPKI-validation in production environments and operate in fail-open test mode. We provide recommendations to improve RPKI resilience and guide stakeholders in securing their deployments against emerging threats. The numerous issues we have discovered with the current RPKI specifications and implementations inevitably lead to the question: Is RPKI sufficiently stable to align with the expectations outlined in the White House roadmap? Certainly, it is not perfect, but is it good enough? The answer, as we will explore, varies depending on one's viewpoint.</p></details> |  |

It has already been widely deployed by large providers and the adoption rate is getting to a critical point. Almost half of all the global prefixes are now covered by RPKI and measurements show that 27% of networks are already using RPKI to validate BGP announcements. Over the past 10 years, there has been much research effort in RPKI, analyzing different facets of the protocol, such as software vulnerabilities, robustness of the infrastructure or the proliferation of RPKI validation. In this work we compile the first systemic overview of the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in RPKI and quantify the security landscape of the global RPKI deployments based on our measurements and analysis. Our study discovers that 56% of the global RPKI validators suffer from at least one documented vulnerability. We also do a systematization of knowledge for existing RPKI security research and complement the existing knowledge with novel measurements in which we discover new trends in availability of RPKI repositories, and their communication patterns with the RPKI validators. We weave together the results of existing research and our study, to provide a comprehensive tableau of vulnerabilities, their sources, and to derive future research paths necessary to prepare RPKI for full global deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper was accepted at USENIX Security '25</p></details> |
| **[Byzantine-Secure Relying Party for Resilient RPKI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00531v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To protect against prefix hijacks, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been standardized. To enjoy the security guarantees of RPKI validation, networks need to install a new component, the relying party validator, which fetches and validates RPKI objects and provides them to border routers. However, recent work shows that relying parties experience failures when retrieving RPKI objects and are vulnerable to attacks, all of which can disable RPKI validation. Therefore even the few adopters are not necessarily secure. We make the first proposal that significantly improves the resilience and security of RPKI. We develop BRP, a Byzantine-Secure relying party implementation. In BRP the relying party nodes redundantly validate RPKI objects and reach a global consensus through voting. BRP provides an RPKI equivalent of public DNS, removing the need for networks to install, operate, and upgrade their own relying party instances while avoiding the need to trust operators of BRP nodes. We show through simulations and experiments that BRP, as an intermediate RPKI service, results in less load on RPKI publication points and a robust output despite RPKI repository failures, jitter, and attacks. We engineer BRP to be fully backward compatible and readily deployable - it does not require any changes to the border routers and the RPKI repositories. We demonstrate that BRP can protect many networks transparently, with either a decentralized or centralized deployment. BRP can be set up as a network of decentralized volunteer deployments, similarly to NTP and TOR, where different operators participate in the peering process with their node, and provide resilient and secure relying party validation to the Internet. BRP can also be hosted by a single operator as a centralized service, e.g., on one cloud or CDN, and provides RPKI validation benefits even when hosted on a single network.</p></details> |  |
| **[The CURE To Vulnerabilities in RPKI Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01872v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over recent years, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has seen increasing adoption, with now 37.8% of the major networks filtering bogus BGP routes. Systems interact with the RPKI over Relying Party (RP) implementations that fetch RPKI objects and feed BGP routers with the validated prefix-ownership data. Consequently, any vulnerabilities or flaws within the RP software can substantially threaten the stability and security of Internet routing. We uncover severe flaws in all popular RP implementations, making them susceptible to path traversal attacks, remotely triggered crashes, and inherent inconsistencies, violating RPKI standards. We report a total of 18 vulnerabilities that canbe exploited to downgrade RPKI validation in border routers or, worse, enable poisoning of the validation process, resulting in malicious prefixes being wrongfully validated and legitimate RPKI-covered prefixes failing validation. Furthermore, our research discloses inconsistencies in the validation process, with two popular implementations leaving 8149 prefixes unprotected from hijacks, 6405 of which belong to Amazon. While these findings are significant in their own right, our principal contribution lies in developing CURE, the first-of-its-kind system to systematically detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and RFC compliance issues in RP implementations via automated test generation. CURE is a powerful RPKI publication point emulator that enables easy and efficient fuzzing of complex RP validation pipelines. It is designed with a set of novel techniques, utilizing differential and stateful fuzzing. We generated over 600 million test cases and tested all popular RPs on them. Following our disclosure, the vendors already assigned CVEs to the vulnerabilities we found.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NDSS '24</p></details> |

To prevent prefix hijacks, networks should deploy RPKI and filter bogus BGP announcements with invalid routes. In this work we evaluate the impact of RPKI deployments on the security and resilience of the Internet. We aim to understand which networks filter invalid routes and how effective that filtering is in blocking prefix hijacks. We extend previous data acquisition and analysis methodologies to obtain more accurate identification of networks that filter invalid routes with RPKI. We find that more than 27% of networks enforce RPKI filtering and show for the first time that deployments follow the business incentives of inter-domain routing: providers have an increased motivation to filter in order to avoid losing customers' traffic. Analyzing the effectiveness of RPKI, we find that the current trend to deploy RPKI on routeservers of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) only provides a localized protection against hijacks but has negligible impact on preventing their spread globally. In contrast, we show that RPKI filtering in Tier-1 providers greatly benefits the security of the Internet as it limits the spread of hijacks to a localized scope. Based on our observations, we provide recommendations on the future roadmap of RPKI deployment.

The key design property in RPKI that allows our attacks is the tradeoff between connectivity and security: when networks cannot retrieve RPKI information from publication points, they make routing decisions in BGP without validating RPKI. We exploit this tradeoff to develop attacks that prevent the retrieval of the RPKI objects from the public repositories, thereby disabling RPKI validation and exposing the RPKI-protected networks to prefix hijack attacks. We demonstrate experimentally that at least 47% of the public repositories are vulnerable against a specific version of our attacks, a rate-limiting off-path downgrade attack. We also show that all the current RPKI relying party implementations are vulnerable to attacks by a malicious publication point. This translates to 20.4% of the IPv4 address space. We provide recommendations for preventing our downgrade attacks. However, resolving the fundamental problem is not straightforward: if the relying parties prefer security over connectivity and insist on RPKI validation when ROAs cannot be retrieved, the victim AS may become disconnected from many more networks than just the one that the adversary wishes to hijack. Our work shows that the publication points are a critical infrastructure for Internet connectivity and security. Our main recommendation is therefore that the publication points should be hosted on robust platforms guaranteeing a high degree of connectivity.</p></details> |  |

RPKI Certificate Authorities issue these attestations and publish them at Publication Points. Relying Party software retrieves and processes the RPKI-related data from all publication points, validates the data and makes it available to routers so they can make secure routing decisions. In this work, we create a threat model for Relying Party software, where an attacker controls a Certificate Authority and Publication Point. We implement a prototype testbed to analyse how current Relying Party software implementations react to scenarios originating from that threat model. Our results show that all current Relying Party software was susceptible to at least one of the identified threats. In addition to this, we also identified threats stemming from choices made in the protocol itself. Taken together, these threats potentially allow an attacker to fully disrupt all RPKI Relying Party software on a global scale. We performed a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure to the implementers and have made our testbed software available for future studies.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, RPKI enables Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) to unilaterally takedown IP prefixes - indeed, such attacks have been launched by nation-state adversaries. The threat of IP prefix takedowns is one of the factors hindering RPKI adoption. In this work, we propose the first distributed RPKI system, based on threshold signatures, that requires the coordination of a number of RIRs to make changes to RPKI objects; hence, preventing unilateral prefix takedown. We perform extensive evaluations using our implementation demonstrating the practicality of our solution. Furthermore, we show that our system is scalable and remains efficient even when RPKI is widely deployed.</p></details> |  |

Access to websites is typically secured via TLS. However, this security model does not account for prefix hijacking on the network layer, which may lead to traffic blackholing or transparent interception. Thus, to achieve comprehensive security and service availability, additional protective mechanisms are necessary such as the RPKI, a recently deployed Resource Public Key Infrastructure to prevent hijacking of traffic by networks. This paper argues two positions. First, that modern web hosting practices make route protection challenging due to the propensity to spread servers across many different networks, often with unpredictable client redirection strategies, and, second, that we need a better understanding why protection mechanisms are not deployed. To initiate this, we empirically explore the relationship between web hosting infrastructure and RPKI deployment. Perversely, we find that less popular websites are more likely to be secured than the prominent sites. Worryingly, we find many large-scale CDNs do not support RPKI, thus making their customers vulnerable. This leads us to explore business reasons why operators are hesitant to deploy RPKI, which may help to guide future research on improving Internet security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previous arXiv version of this paper has been published under the title "When BGP Security Meets Content Deployment: Measuring and Analysing RPKI-Protection of Websites", Proc. of Fourteenth ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets), New York:ACM, 2015</p></details> |

The first SAV scheme is based on the original SAV method for the gradient flow model, while the second scheme features an updated scalar auxiliary variable to better align with the associated energy. To address the challenging constraint of pointwise constant magnetization length, an implicit projection method is designed, and verified by both SAV schemes. Both proposed SAV schemes partially preserve energy dissipation and exhibit exceptional efficiency, requiring two linear systems with constant coefficients to be solved. The computational efficiency is further enhanced by applying the Discrete Cosine Transform during the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our SAV schemes outperform commonly used numerical methods in terms of both efficiency and stability.</p></details> |  |

However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language models (LLM)-powered conversational SAV agents affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational SAV agents powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors, such as psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We designed four SAV agents with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results indicate that an SAV designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities, and its responses were perceived as more positive but also more subjective compared to the control conditions. Qualitative findings support established routes to psychological ownership in the SAV context and suggest that the conversational agent's perceived performance may also influence psychological ownership. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes highlight the importance of personalization in designing effective SAV interactions. These findings provide practical guidance for designing conversational SAV agents that enhance user experience and adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams, we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality, highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e., perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method. Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IEEE ITSC 2025 and for publication in its Proceedings. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

More precisely, the fully discrete scheme combines the marker-and-cell (MAC) finite difference spatial approximation and BDF2 temporal discretization, as well as the Adams-Bashforth extrapolation for the nonlinear terms, based on the SAV-ZEC reformulation. A pressure correction approach is applied to decouple the Stokes equation. Only constant-coefficient Poisson-like solvers are needed in the implementation for the resulting numerical system. The numerical scheme is unconditionally stable with respect to a rewritten total energy functional, represented in terms of one auxiliary variable in the double-well potential, another auxiliary variable to balance all the nonlinear and coupled terms, the surface energy in the original phase variable, combined with the kinematic energy part. Specifically, the error estimate for the phase variable in the $\ell^{\infty}(0,T;H_h^1)\cap\ell^2(0,T;H_h^3)$ norm, the velocity variable in the $\ell^{\infty}(0,T;\ell^2)\cap\ell^2(0,T;H_h^1)$ norm, is derived with optimal convergence rates.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, their theoretical properties are not yet fully understood, especially when finite elements are used for the spatial discretisation. This work proposes a simple scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) technique that, when combined with standard finite elements in space, guarantees unconditional stability for first- and second-order consistent splitting schemes. The framework is implicit-explicit (IMEX) and only requires solving linear transport equations and a pressure Poisson problem per time step. Furthermore, pressure stability is attained with respect to a stronger norm than in classical projection schemes, which allows eliminating the inf-sup compatibility requirement on the velocity-pressure pairs. The accuracy of the new framework is assessed through numerical examples.</p></details> |  |

For time discretization, we employ the two scalar auxiliary variables (SAVs) and the pressure-correction projection method. For spatial discretization, we choose the $P_r \times P_r \times \mathbf{P}_{r+1} \times P_r$ finite element spaces, where $r$ is the degree of the local polynomials, and derive the optimal $L^2$ error estimates for the phase-field variable, chemical potential, and pressure in the case of $r \geq 1$, and for the velocity when $r \geq 2$, without relying on the quasi-projection operator technique proposed in \textit{[Cai et al. SIAM J Numer Anal, 2023]}. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, confirming the unconditional energy stability and optimal convergence rates of the proposed scheme. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the optimal $L^2$ convergence rate for the velocity when $r=1$.</p></details> |  |

We employ the BDF2 scheme for time discretization and a conservative VEM for spatial discretization, in which the mass conservation in the velocity field is kept by taking advantage of the virtual element method's adaptability and its divergence-free characteristics. In our scheme, the nonlinear terms are handled explicitly using the SAV method, and the magnetic field is decoupled from the velocity and pressure. This decoupling only requires solving a sequence of linear systems with constant coefficient at each time step. The stability estimate of the fully discrete scheme is developed, demonstrating the scheme is unconditionally stable. Moreover, rigorous error estimates for the velocity and magnetic field are provided. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the valid of theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, stability of IMEX schemes cannot be guaranteed for general nonlinear problems. In this article, we present a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) stabilization of high-order IMEX time integration schemes that leads to unconditional stability. The proposed IMEX-BDFk-SAV schemes treat linear terms implicitly using kth-order backward difference formulas (BDFk) and nonlinear terms explicitly. This eliminates the need for iterations in nonlinear problems and leads to low computational cost. Truncation error analysis of the proposed IMEX-BDFk-SAV schemes confirms that up to kth-order accuracy can be achieved and this is verified through a series of convergence tests. Unlike existing SAV schemes for first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a novel SAV for the proposed schemes that allows direct solution of the second-order ODEs without transforming them to a system of first-order ODEs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes by solving several nonlinear problems in structural dynamics and show that the proposed schemes can achieve high accuracy at a low computational cost while maintaining unconditional stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[High-efficiency and positivity-preserving stabilized SAV methods for gradient flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08893v1)** | 2023-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV)-type methods are very popular techniques for solving various nonlinear dissipative systems. Compared to the semi-implicit method, the baseline SAV method can keep a modified energy dissipation law but doubles the computational cost. The general SAV approach does not add additional computation but needs to solve a semi-implicit solution in advance, which may potentially compromise the accuracy and stability. In this paper, we construct a novel first- and second-order unconditional energy stable and positivity-preserving stabilized SAV (PS-SAV) schemes for $L^2$ and $H^{-1}$ gradient flows. The constructed schemes can reduce nearly half computational cost of the baseline SAV method and preserve its accuracy and stability simultaneously. Meanwhile, the introduced auxiliary variable is always positive while the baseline SAV cannot guarantee this positivity-preserving property. Unconditionally energy dissipation laws are derived for the proposed numerical schemes. We also establish a rigorous error analysis of the first-order scheme for the Allen-Cahn type equation in $l^{\infty}(0,T; H^1(\Omega) ) $ norm. In addition we propose an energy optimization technique to optimize the modified energy close to the original energy. Several interesting numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A mobility-SAV approach for a Cahn-Hilliard equation with degenerate mobilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15329v2)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel numerical strategy is introduced for computing approximations of solutions to a Cahn-Hilliard model with degenerate mobilities. This model has recently been introduced as a second-order phase-field approximation for surface diffusion flows. Its numerical discretization is challenging due to the degeneracy of the mobilities, which generally requires an implicit treatment to avoid stability issues at the price of increased complexity costs. To mitigate this drawback, we consider new first- and second-order Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) schemes that, differently from existing approaches, focus on the relaxation of the mobility, rather than the Cahn-Hilliard energy. These schemes are introduced and analysed theoretically in the general context of gradient flows and then specialised for the Cahn-Hilliard equation with mobilities. Various numerical experiments are conducted to highlight the advantages of these new schemes in terms of accuracy, effectiveness and computational cost.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |

It enjoys several distinct advantages over popular gradient based methods: (i) it is unconditionally energy diminishing with a modified energy which is intrinsically related to the original energy, thus no parameter tuning is needed for stability; (ii) it allows the use of large step-sizes which can effectively accelerate the convergence rate. We also present a convergence analysis for some SAV based algorithms, which include our new algorithm without the relaxation step as a special case. We apply our new algorithm to several illustrative and benchmark problems, and compare its performance with several popular gradient based methods. The numerical results indicate that the new algorithm is very robust, and its adaptive version usually converges significantly faster than those popular gradient descent based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel energy-optimal scalar auxiliary variable (EOP-SAV) approach for gradient flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11288v1)** | 2023-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach has become very popular and hot in the design of linear, high-order and unconditional energy stable schemes of gradient flow models. However, the nature of SAV-based numerical schemes preserving modified energy dissipation limits its wider application. A relaxation technique to correct the modified energy for the baseline SAV method (RSAV) was proposed by Zhao et al. and Shen et al.. The RSAV approach is unconditionally energy stable with respect to a modified energy that is closer to the original free energy, and provides a much improved accuracy when compared with the SAV approach. In this paper, inspired by the RSAV approach, we propose a novel technique to correct the modified energy of the SAV approach, which can be proved to be an optimal energy approximation. We construct new high-order implicit-explicit schemes based on the proposed energy-optimal SAV (EOP-SAV) approach. The constructed EOP-SAV schemes not only provide an improved accuracy but also simplify calculation, and can be viewed as the optimal relaxation. We also prove that the numerical schemes based on the EOP-SAV approach are unconditionally energy stable. Compared with the RSAV approach, the proposed EOP-SAV approach does not need introduce any relaxed factors and can share the similar procedure for error estimates. Several interesting numerical examples have been presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Scala...</summary><p>Scalar auxiliary variable, Gradient flow, Relaxation, Optimal, Error analysis</p></details> |

First, by applying a finite volume method with upwind numerical fluxes to the degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation rewritten by the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, we creatively obtain an unconditionally bound-preserving, energy-stable and fully-discrete scheme, which, for the first time, addresses the boundedness of the classical SAV approach under $H^{-1}$-gradient flow. Then, a dimensional-splitting technique is introduced in high-dimensional cases, which greatly reduces the computational complexity while preserves original structural properties. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the bound-preserving and energy-stable properties of the proposed scheme. Finally, by applying the proposed structure-preserving scheme, we numerically demonstrate that surface diffusion can be approximated by the Cahn--Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility and Flory--Huggins potential when the absolute temperature is sufficiently low, which agrees well with the theoretical result by using formal asymptotic analysis.wn theoretically by formal matched asymptotics.</p></details> |  |

The key to our analysis is to convert the structure of the SAV time-stepping scheme back to a form compatible with the original format of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which makes it feasible to use spectral estimates to handle the nonlinear term. Based on the transformation of the SAV numerical scheme, the optimal error estimate for the temporal semi-discrete scheme which depends only on the low polynomial order of $\varepsilon^{-1}$ instead of the exponential order, is derived by using mathematical induction, spectral arguments, and the superconvergence properties of some nonlinear terms. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the discrete energy decay property and validate our theoretical convergence analysis.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

It is proved that the modified energy dissipation law is unconditionally preserved at discrete levels. Under a mild ratio restriction, i.e., \Ass{1}: $0<r_k:=\tau_k/\tau_{k-1}< r_{\max}\approx 4.8645$, we establish a rigorous error estimate in $H^1$-norm and achieve optimal second-order accuracy in time. The proof involves the tools of discrete orthogonal convolution (DOC) kernels and inequality zoom. It is worth noting that the presented adaptive time-step scheme only requires solving one linear system with constant coefficients at each time step. In our analysis, the first-consistent BDF1 for the first step does not bring the order reduction in $H^1$-norm. The $H^1$ bound of the numerical solution under periodic boundary conditions can be derived without any restriction (such as zero mean of the initial data).

We prove that they can be solved explicitly and preserve the modified energy evolution law and the regularity structure of the original system. These structure-preserving properties are the keys to overcoming the mutual effect of the noise and nonlinearity. By proving new regularity estimates of the introduced SAV, we establish the strong convergence rate of stochastic SAV schemes and the further fully-discrete schemes with the finite element method in spatial direction.

In recent years, the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method and many of its variants have attracted much attention in numerical solution for gradient flow problems due to their inherent advantage of preserving certain discrete analogues of the energy dissipation law. However, existing SAV schemes usually fail to preserve the MBP when applied to the Allen-Cahn equation. In this paper, we develop and analyze new first- and second-order stabilized exponential-SAV schemes for a class of Allen-Cahn type equations, which are shown to simultaneously preserve the energy dissipation law and MBP in discrete settings. In addition, optimal error estimates for the numerical solutions are rigorously obtained for both schemes. Extensive numerical tests and comparisons are also conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes.</p></details> |  |

While some commonly-used first-order time stepping schemes have turned out to preserve unconditionally both energy dissipation law and MBP for the equation, restrictions on the time step size are still needed for existing second-order or even higher-order schemes in order to have such simultaneous preservation. In this paper, we develop and analyze novel first- and second-order linear numerical schemes for a class of Allen-Cahn type gradient flows. Our schemes combine the generalized scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach and the exponential time integrator with a stabilization term, while the standard central difference stencil is used for discretization of the spatial differential operator. We not only prove their unconditional preservation of the energy dissipation law and the MBP in the discrete setting, but also derive their optimal temporal error estimates under fixed spatial mesh.

However, the discrete value of the SAV is not directly linked to the free energy of the dissipative system, and may lead to inaccurate solutions if the time step is not sufficiently small.

The R-GSAV approach preserves all the advantages of the GSAV appraoch, in addition, it dissipates a modified energy that is directly linked to the original free energy. We prove that the $k$-th order implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes based on R-GSAV are unconditionally energy stable, and we carry out a rigorous error analysis for $k=1,2,3,4,5$.

While extensively studied in IPv4 networks, DDoS implications in IPv6 remain underexplored. The vast IPv6 address space renders brute-force scanning and amplifier testing for all active addresses impractical. Innovatively, this work investigates AS-level vulnerabilities to reflection amplification attacks in IPv6. One prerequisite for amplification presence is that it is located in a vulnerable autonomous system (AS) without inbound source address validation (ISAV) deployment. Hence, the analysis focuses on two critical aspects: global detection of ISAV deployment and identification of amplifiers within vulnerable ASes. Specifically, we develop a methodology combining ICMP Time Exceeded mechanisms for ISAV detection, employ IPv6 address scanning for amplifier identification, and utilize dual vantage points for amplification verification. Experimental results reveal that 4,460 ASes (61.36% of measured networks) lack ISAV deployment. Through scanning approximately 47M active addresses, we have identified reflection amplifiers in 3,507 ASes. The analysis demonstrates that current IPv6 networks are fertile grounds for reflection amplification attacks, alarming network security.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IWQoS 2025 as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Martians Among Us: Observing Private or Reserved IPs on the Public Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16805v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoofed traffic has been identified as one of the main issues of concern for network hygiene nowadays, as it facilitates Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by hiding their origin and complicating forensic investigations. Some indicators of poor network hygiene are packets with Bogon or Martian source addresses representing either misconfigurations or spoofed packets. Despite the development of Source Address Validation (SAV) techniques and guidelines such as BCP 38 and BCP 84, Bogons are often overlooked in the filtering practices of network operators. This study uses traceroute measurements from the CAIDA Ark dataset, enriched with historical BGP routing information from RIPE RIS and RouteViews, to investigate the prevalence of Bogon addresses over seven years (2017-2023). Our analysis reveals widespread non-compliance with best practices, with Bogon traffic detected across thousands of ASes. Notably, 82.69%-97.83% of CAIDA Ark vantage points observe paths containing Bogon IPs, primarily RFC1918 addresses. Additionally, 19.70% of all analyzed traceroutes include RFC1918 addresses, while smaller proportions involve RFC6598 (1.50%) and RFC3927 (0.10%) addresses. We identify more than 13,000 unique ASes transiting Bogon traffic, with only 11.64% appearing in more than half of the measurements. Cross-referencing with the Spoofer project and MANRS initiatives shows a concerning gap: 62.67% of ASes that do not filter packets with Bogon sources are marked as non-spoofable, suggesting incomplete SAV implementation. Our contributions include an assessment of network hygiene using the transiting of Bogon packets as a metric, an analysis of the main types of Bogon addresses found in traceroutes, and several proposed recommendations to address the observed gaps, enforcing the need for stronger compliance with best practices to improve global network security.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multicast Scheme for Live Streaming Courses in Large-Scale, Geographically Dense Campus Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06334v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video courses have become a significant component of modern education. However, the increasing demand for live streaming video courses places considerable strain on the service capabilities of campus networks. The challenges associated with live streaming course videos in campus network environments exhibit distinct spatial distribution characteristics. The audience for specific video courses may be highly concentrated in certain areas, leading to a large number of users attempting to access the same live stream simultaneously. Utilizing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute videos in these campus scenarios creates substantial unicast pressure on edge CDN servers. This paper proposes a two-layer dynamic partitioning Recursive Bit String (RBS) virtual domain network layer multicast architecture specifically designed for large-scale, geographically dense multicast scenarios within campus networks. This approach reduces redundant multicast messages by approximately 10-30\% compared to the two-layer fixed partitioning method. Additionally, it establishes multicast source authentication capabilities based on Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) and facilitates secure multicast group key exchange using a concise exchange protocol within the WebRTC framework. In the next-generation data plane of programmable software-defined networks, the RBS stateless multicast technology can be integrated with the unique characteristics of large-scale, geographically dense campus network scenarios to dynamically and efficiently extend multicast coverage to every dormitory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guardians of DNS Integrity: A Remote Method for Identifying DNSSEC Validators Across the Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19851v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide the most effective way to fight DNS cache poisoning attacks. Yet, very few DNS resolvers perform DNSSEC validation. Identifying such systems is non-trivial and the existing methods are not suitable for Internet-scale measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel remote technique for identifying DNSSEC-validating resolvers. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, we identify open resolvers by scanning 3.1 billion end hosts and request every non-forwarder to resolve one correct and seven deliberately misconfigured domains. We then build a classifier that discriminates validators from non-validators based on query patterns and DNS response codes. We find that while most open resolvers are DNSSEC-enabled, less than 18% in IPv4 (38% in IPv6) validate received responses. In the second step, we remotely identify closed non-forwarders in networks that do not have inbound Source Address Validation (SAV) in place. Using the classifier built in step one, we identify 37.4% IPv4 (42.9% IPv6) closed DNSSEC validators and cross-validate the results using RIPE Atlas probes. Finally, we show that the discovered (non)-validators actively send requests to DNS root servers, suggesting that we deal with operational recursive resolvers rather than misconfigured machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Router is My Prober: Measuring IPv6 Networks via ICMP Rate Limiting Side Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13088v3)** | 2023-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active Internet measurements face challenges when some measurements require many remote vantage points. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for measuring remote IPv6 networks via side channels in ICMP rate limiting, a required function for IPv6 nodes to limit the rate at which ICMP error messages are generated. This technique, iVantage, can to some extent use 1.1M remote routers distributed in 9.5k autonomous systems and 182 countries as our "vantage points". We apply iVantage to two different, but both challenging measurement tasks: 1) measuring the deployment of inbound source address validation (ISAV) and 2) measuring reachability between arbitrary Internet nodes. We accomplish these two tasks from only one local vantage point without controlling the targets or relying on other services within the target networks. Our large-scale ISAV measurements cover ~50% of all IPv6 autonomous systems and find ~79% of them are vulnerable to spoofing, which is the most large-scale measurement study of IPv6 ISAV to date. Our method for reachability measurements achieves over 80% precision and recall in our evaluation. Finally, we perform an Internet-wide measurement of the ICMP rate limiting implementations, present a detailed discussion on ICMP rate limiting, particularly the potential security and privacy risks in the mechanism of ICMP rate limiting, and provide possible mitigation measures. We make our code available to the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Closed Resolver Project: Measuring the Deployment of Source Address Validation of Inbound Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05277v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source Address Validation (SAV) is a standard aimed at discarding packets with spoofed source IP addresses. The absence of SAV for outgoing traffic has been known as a root cause of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and received widespread attention. While less obvious, the absence of inbound filtering enables an attacker to appear as an internal host of a network and may reveal valuable information about the network infrastructure. Inbound IP spoofing may amplify other attack vectors such as DNS cache poisoning or the recently discovered NXNSAttack. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of the Closed Resolver Project that aims at mitigating the problem of inbound IP spoofing. We perform the first Internet-wide active measurement study to enumerate networks that filter or do not filter incoming packets by their source address, for both the IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces. To achieve this, we identify closed and open DNS resolvers that accept spoofed requests coming from the outside of their network. The proposed method provides the most complete picture of inbound SAV deployment by network providers. Our measurements cover over 55 % IPv4 and 27 % IPv6 Autonomous Systems (AS) and reveal that the great majority of them are fully or partially vulnerable to inbound spoofing. By identifying dual-stacked DNS resolvers, we additionally show that inbound filtering is less often deployed for IPv6 than it is for IPv4. Overall, we discover 13.9 K IPv6 open resolvers that can be exploited for amplification DDoS attacks - 13 times more than previous work. Furthermore, we enumerate uncover 4.25 M IPv4 and 103 K IPv6 vulnerable closed resolvers that could only be detected thanks to our spoofing technique, and that pose a significant threat when combined with the NXNSAttack.</p></details> |  |

| **[Subverting Stateful Firewalls with Protocol States (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09604v5)** | 2022-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyzed the generation of protocol header fields in the implementations of multiple TCP/IP network stacks and found new ways to leak information about global protocol states. We then demonstrated new covert channels by remotely observing and modifying the system's global state via these protocol fields. Unlike earlier works, our research focuses on hosts that reside in firewalled networks (including source address validation -- SAV), which is a very common scenario nowadays. Our attacks are designed to be non-disruptive -- in the exfiltration scenario, this makes the attacks stealthier and thus extends their longevity, and in case of host alias resolution and similar techniques -- this ensures the techniques are ethical. We focused on ICMP, which is commonly served by firewalls, and on UDP, which is forecasted to take a more prominent share of the Internet traffic with the advent of HTTP/3 and QUIC, though we report results for TCP as well. The information leakage scenarios we discovered enable the construction of practical covert channels which directly pierce firewalls, or indirectly establish communication via hosts in firewalled networks that also employ SAV. We describe and test three novel attacks in this context: exfiltration via the firewall itself, exfiltration via a DMZ host, and exfiltration via co-resident containers. These are three generic, new use cases for covert channels that work around firewalling and enable devices that are not allowed direct communication with the Internet, to still exfiltrate data out of the network. In other words, we exfiltrate data from isolated networks to the Internet. We also explain how to mount known attacks such as host alias resolution, de-NATting and container co-residence detection, using the new information leakage techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this paper is to be presented in NDSS 2022.

Inferring the Deployment of Source Address Validation of Inbound Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00441v1)** | 2020-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper concerns the problem of the absence of ingress filtering at the network edge, one of the main causes of important network security issues. Numerous network operators do not deploy the best current practice - Source Address Validation (SAV) that aims at mitigating these issues. We perform the first Internet-wide active measurement study to enumerate networks not filtering incoming packets by their source address. The measurement method consists of identifying closed and open DNS resolvers handling requests coming from the outside of the network with the source address from the range assigned inside the network under the test. The proposed method provides the most complete picture of the inbound SAV deployment state at network providers. We reveal that 32 673 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and 197 641 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) prefixes are vulnerable to spoofing of inbound traffic. Finally, using the data from the Spoofer project and performing an open resolver scan, we compare the filtering policies in both directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeZone: A Hierarchical Inter-Domain Authenticated Source Address Validation Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3766v1)** | 2011-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next generation Internet is highly concerned about the issue of reliability. Principally, the foundation of reliability is authentication of the source IP address. With the signature-and-verification based defense mechanisms available today, unfortunately, there is a lack of hierarchical architecture, which makes the structure of the trust alliance excessively flat and single. Moreover, with the increasing scale of the trust alliance, costs of validation grow so quickly that they do not adapt to incremental deployment. Via comparison with traditional solutions, this article proposes a hierarchical, inter-domain authenticated source address validation solution named SafeZone. SafeZone employs two intelligent designs, lightweight tag replacement and a hierarchical partitioning scheme, each of which helps to ensure that SafeZone can construct trustworthy and hierarchical trust alliances without the negative influences and complex operations on de facto networks. Extensive experiments also indicate that SafeZone can effectively obtain the design goals of a hierarchical architecture, along with lightweight, loose coupling and "multi-fence support" and as well as an incremental deployment scheme.</p></details> |  |
