| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCycle: Fast and Efficient Long Time Series Forecasting with Residual Cyclic Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03429v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have recently gained prominence in long time series forecasting by elevating accuracies in a variety of use cases. Regrettably, in the race for better predictive performance the overhead of model architectures has grown onerous, leading to models with computational demand infeasible for most practical applications. To bridge the gap between high method complexity and realistic computational resources, we introduce the Residual Cyclic Transformer, ReCycle. ReCycle utilizes primary cycle compression to address the computational complexity of the attention mechanism in long time series. By learning residuals from refined smoothing average techniques, ReCycle surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy in a variety of application use cases. The reliable and explainable fallback behavior ensured by simple, yet robust, smoothing average techniques additionally lowers the barrier for user acceptance. At the same time, our approach reduces the run time and energy consumption by more than an order of magnitude, making both training and inference feasible on low-performance, low-power and edge computing devices. Code is available at https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/ReCycle</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, to be published at IEEE CAI 2024, Associated code available at https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/ReCycle</p></details> |
| **[Synergy and Redundancy Dominated Effects in Time Series via Transfer Entropy Decompositions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05728v3)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new decomposition of transfer entropy to characterize the degree of synergy- and redundancy-dominated influence a time series has upon the interaction between other time series. We prove the existence of a class of time series, where the early past of the conditioning time series yields a synergistic effect upon the interaction, whereas the late past has a redundancy-dominated effect. In general, different parts of the past can have different effects. Our information theoretic quantities are easy to compute in practice, and we demonstrate their usage on real-world brain data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at the NeurIT: Information theory in neuroscience and neuroengineering workshop.

| **[Understanding the Vulnerability of Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition via Black-box Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11312v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been employed in a wide range of applications, e.g. self-driving cars, where safety and lives are at stake. Recently, the robustness of skeleton-based HAR methods have been questioned due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, the proposed attacks require the full-knowledge of the attacked classifier, which is overly restrictive. In this paper, we show such threats indeed exist, even when the attacker only has access to the input/output of the model. To this end, we propose the very first black-box adversarial attack approach in skeleton-based HAR called BASAR. BASAR explores the interplay between the classification boundary and the natural motion manifold. To our best knowledge, this is the first time data manifold is introduced in adversarial attacks on time series. Via BASAR, we find on-manifold adversarial samples are extremely deceitful and rather common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation, we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across classifiers, datasets, and attack modes. By attack, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of the model vulnerability and provides insights on possible improvements. Finally, to mitigate the newly identified threat, we propose a new adversarial training approach by leveraging the sophisticated distributions of on/off-manifold adversarial samples, called mixed manifold-based adversarial training (MMAT). MMAT can successfully help defend against adversarial attacks without compromising classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Pattern Recognition. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.05266</p></details> |
| **[Denoising of Geodetic Time Series Using Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: Application to Slow Slip Event Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03320v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet, as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals. Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Detecting and Early Predicting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease from Spirogram Time Series: A UK Biobank Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03239v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung condition that causes airflow obstruction. The existing methods can only detect patients who already have COPD based on obvious features shown in the spirogram (In this article, the spirogram specifically involves measuring Volume-Flow curve time series). Early prediction of COPD risk is vital for monitoring COPD disease progression, slowing it down, or even preventing its onset. However, these methods fail to early predict an individual's probability of COPD in the future based on subtle features in the spirogram. To address this gap, for the first time, we propose DeepSpiro, a method based on deep learning for early prediction of future COPD risk. DeepSpiro consists of four parts. First, we construct Volume-Flow curves guided by Time-Volume instability smoothing (SpiroSmoother) to enhance the stability of the original Volume-Flow curves precisely. Second, we extract critical features from the evolution of varied-length key patches (SpiroEncoder) to capture the key temporal evolution from original high-dimensional dynamic sequences to a unified low-dimensional temporal representation. Third, we explain the model based on temporal attention and heterogeneous feature fusion (SpiroExplainer), which integrates information from heterogeneous data such as spirogram and demographic information. Fourth, we predict the risk of COPD based on the evolution of key patch concavity (SpiroPredictor), enabling accurate prediction of the risk of disease in high-risk patients who are not yet diagnosed, for up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, and beyond. We conduct experiments on the UK Biobank dataset. Results show that DeepSpiro achieves an AUC value of 0.8328 in the task of detecting COPD. In early prediction tasks, high-risk and low-risk groups show significant differences in the future, with a p-value of <0.001.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reliable Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Anomaly Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03234v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performed models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights to detect such issues by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation with two time series datasets and user studies demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD in fostering a deeper human understanding, immediate corrective actions, and the reliability enhancement of models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Boosting MLPs with a Coarsening Strategy for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03199v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have been exerting their strengths in long-term time series forecasting. However, they often struggle to strike a balance between expressive power and computational efficiency. Here, we propose the Coarsened Perceptron Network (CP-Net), a novel architecture that efficiently enhances the predictive capability of MLPs while maintains a linear computational complexity. It utilizes a coarsening strategy as the backbone that leverages two-stage convolution-based sampling blocks. Based purely on convolution, they provide the functionality of extracting short-term semantic and contextual patterns, which is relatively deficient in the global point-wise projection of the MLP layer. With the architectural simplicity and low runtime, our experiments on seven time series forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that CP-Net achieves an improvement of 4.1% compared to the SOTA method. The model further shows effective utilization of the exposed information with a consistent improvement as the look-back window expands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Stock Price Forecasting Based on Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03151v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a time series algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) optimization is used to forecast stock prices effectively, taking into account the trend of the big data era. The data are first analyzed by descriptive statistics, and then the model is built and trained and tested on the dataset. After optimization and adjustment, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the model gradually decreases from 0.11 to 0.01 and tends to be stable, indicating that the model prediction effect is gradually close to the real value. The results on the test set show that the time series algorithm optimized based on Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) is able to accurately predict the stock prices, and is highly consistent with the actual price trends and values, with strong generalization ability. The MAE on the test set is 2.41, the MSE is 9.84, the RMSE is 3.13, and the R2 is 0.87. This research result not only provides a novel stock price prediction method, but also provides a useful reference for financial market analysis using computer technology and big data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSLANet: Rethinking Transformers for Time Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08472v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data, characterized by its intrinsic long and short-range dependencies, poses a unique challenge across analytical applications. While Transformer-based models excel at capturing long-range dependencies, they face limitations in noise sensitivity, computational efficiency, and overfitting with smaller datasets. In response, we introduce a novel Time Series Lightweight Adaptive Network (TSLANet), as a universal convolutional model for diverse time series tasks. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Spectral Block, harnessing Fourier analysis to enhance feature representation and to capture both long-term and short-term interactions while mitigating noise via adaptive thresholding. Additionally, we introduce an Interactive Convolution Block and leverage self-supervised learning to refine the capacity of TSLANet for decoding complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness on different datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TSLANet outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks spanning classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, showcasing its resilience and adaptability across a spectrum of noise levels and data sizes. The code is available at https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TSLANet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[TimeMIL: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Classification via a Time-aware Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03140v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks, including transformers and convolutional neural networks, have significantly improved multivariate time series classification (MTSC). However, these methods often rely on supervised learning, which does not fully account for the sparsity and locality of patterns in time series data (e.g., diseases-related anomalous points in ECG). To address this challenge, we formally reformulate MTSC as a weakly supervised problem, introducing a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for better localization of patterns of interest and modeling time dependencies within time series. Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized learnable wavelet positional token. The proposed method surpassed 26 recent state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the effectiveness of the weakly supervised TimeMIL in MTSC.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2024 |
| **[Bayesian Functional Graphical Models with Change-Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03041v1)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional data analysis, which models data as realizations of random functions over a continuum, has emerged as a useful tool for time series data. Often, the goal is to infer the dynamic connections (or time-varying conditional dependencies) among multiple functions or time series. For this task, we propose a dynamic and Bayesian functional graphical model. Our modeling approach prioritizes the careful definition of an appropriate graph to identify both time-invariant and time-varying connectivity patterns. We introduce a novel block-structured sparsity prior paired with a finite basis expansion, which together yield effective shrinkage and graph selection with efficient computations via a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Crucially, the model includes (one or more) graph changepoints, which are learned jointly with all model parameters and incorporate graph dynamics. Simulation studies demonstrate excellent graph selection capabilities, with significant improvements over competing methods. We apply the proposed approach to study of dynamic connectivity patterns of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and discovers meaningful edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised for Computational Statistics and Data Analysis</p></details> |
| **[Analysis of the Identifying Regulation with Adversarial Surrogates Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02953v1)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a time-series of noisy measured outputs of a dynamical system z[k], k=1...N, the Identifying Regulation with Adversarial Surrogates (IRAS) algorithm aims to find a non-trivial first integral of the system, namely, a scalar function g() such that g(z[i]) = g(z[j]), for all i,j. IRAS has been suggested recently and was used successfully in several learning tasks in models from biology and physics. Here, we give the first rigorous analysis of this algorithm in a specific setting. We assume that the observations admit a linear first integral and that they are contaminated by Gaussian noise. We show that in this case the IRAS iterations are closely related to the self-consistent-field (SCF) iterations for solving a generalized Rayleigh quotient minimization problem. Using this approach, we derive several sufficient conditions guaranteeing local convergence of IRAS to the correct first integral.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine learning of network inference enhancement from noisy measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02050v2)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring networks from observed time series data presents a clear glimpse into the interconnections among nodes. Network inference models, when dealing with real-world open cases, especially in the presence of observational noise, experience a sharp decline in performance, significantly undermining their practical applicability. We find that in real-world scenarios, noisy samples cause parameter updates in network inference models to deviate from the correct direction, leading to a degradation in performance. Here, we present an elegant and efficient model-agnostic framework tailored to amplify the capabilities of model-based and model-free network inference models for real-world cases. Extensive experiments across nonlinear dynamics, evolutionary games, and epidemic spreading, showcases substantial performance augmentation under varied noise types, particularly thriving in scenarios enriched with clean samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limiting Behavior of Maxima under Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02833v1)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weak convergence of maxima of dependent sequences of identically distributed continuous random variables is studied under normalizing sequences arising as subsequences of the normalizing sequences from an associated iid sequence. This general framework allows one to derive several generalizations of the well-known Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem under conditions on the univariate marginal distribution and the dependence structure of the sequence. The limiting distributions are shown to be compositions of a generalized extreme value distribution and a distortion function which reflects the limiting behavior of the diagonal of the underlying copula. Uniform convergence rates for the weak convergence to the limiting distribution are also derived. Examples covering well-known dependence structures are provided. Several existing results, e.g. for exchangeable sequences or stationary time series, are embedded in the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position Paper: Quo Vadis, Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02678v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current state of machine learning scholarship in Timeseries Anomaly Detection (TAD) is plagued by the persistent use of flawed evaluation metrics, inconsistent benchmarking practices, and a lack of proper justification for the choices made in novel deep learning-based model designs. Our paper presents a critical analysis of the status quo in TAD, revealing the misleading track of current research and highlighting problematic methods, and evaluation practices. Our position advocates for a shift in focus from pursuing only the novelty in model design to improving benchmarking practices, creating non-trivial datasets, and placing renewed emphasis on studying the utility of model architectures for specific tasks. Our findings demonstrate the need for rigorous evaluation protocols, the creation of simple baselines, and the revelation that state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection models effectively learn linear mappings. These findings suggest the need for more exploration and development of simple and interpretable TAD methods. The increment of model complexity in the state-of-the-art deep-learning based models unfortunately offers very little improvement. We offer insights and suggestions for the field to move forward.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[From Generalization Analysis to Optimization Designs for State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02670v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A State Space Model (SSM) is a foundation model in time series analysis, which has recently been shown as an alternative to transformers in sequence modeling. In this paper, we theoretically study the generalization of SSMs and propose improvements to training algorithms based on the generalization results. Specifically, we give a \textit{data-dependent} generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences. Leveraging the generalization bound, we (1) set up a scaling rule for model initialization based on the proposed generalization measure, which significantly improves the robustness of the output value scales on SSMs to different temporal patterns in the sequence data; (2) introduce a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the generalization performance. Numerical results are conducted to validate our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assembling ensembling: An adventure in approaches across disciplines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02599v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we think of model ensembling or ensemble modeling, there are many possibilities that come to mind in different disciplines. For example, one might think of a set of descriptions of a phenomenon in the world, perhaps a time series or a snapshot of multivariate space, and perhaps that set is comprised of data-independent descriptions, or perhaps it is quite intentionally fit *to* data, or even a suite of data sets with a common theme or intention. The very meaning of 'ensemble' - a collection together - conjures different ideas across and even within disciplines approaching phenomena. In this paper, we present a typology of the scope of these potential perspectives. It is not our goal to present a review of terms and concepts, nor is it to convince all disciplines to adopt a common suite of terms, which we view as futile. Rather, our goal is to disambiguate terms, concepts, and processes associated with 'ensembles' and 'ensembling' in order to facilitate communication, awareness, and possible adoption of tools across disciplines.</p></details> | 33 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Deep Representation Learning-Based Dynamic Trajectory Phenotyping for Acute Respiratory Failure in Medical Intensive Care Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02563v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis-induced acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a serious complication with a poor prognosis. This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02485v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[FocusLearn: Fully-Interpretable, High-Performance Modular Neural Networks for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16834v4)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series have many applications, from healthcare and meteorology to life science. Although deep learning models have shown excellent predictive performance for time series, they have been criticised for being "black-boxes" or non-interpretable. This paper proposes a novel modular neural network model for multivariate time series prediction that is interpretable by construction. A recurrent neural network learns the temporal dependencies in the data while an attention-based feature selection component selects the most relevant features and suppresses redundant features used in the learning of the temporal dependencies. A modular deep network is trained from the selected features independently to show the users how features influence outcomes, making the model interpretable. Experimental results show that this approach can outperform state-of-the-art interpretable Neural Additive Models (NAM) and variations thereof in both regression and classification of time series tasks, achieving a predictive performance that is comparable to the top non-interpretable methods for time series, LSTM and XGBoost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Ferry Passenger Flow Using Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02098v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent studies related to Neural Networks being used on different forecasting and time series investigations, this study aims to expand these contexts to ferry passenger traffic. The primary objective of the study is to investigate and evaluate an LSTM-based Neural Networks' capability to forecast ferry passengers of two ports in the Philippines. The proposed model's fitting and evaluation of the passenger flow forecasting of the two ports is based on monthly passenger traffic from 2016 to 2022 data that was acquired from the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA). This work uses Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as its primary metric to evaluate the model's forecasting capability. The proposed LSTM-based Neural Networks model achieved 72% forecasting accuracy to the Batangas port ferry passenger data and 74% forecasting accuracy to the Mindoro port ferry passenger data. Using Keras and Scikit-learn Python libraries, this work concludes a reasonable forecasting performance of the presented LSTM model. Aside from these notable findings, this study also recommends further investigation and studies on employing other statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods on forecasting ferry passenger flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of Long-Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks for Real-Time Bridge Scour Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16549v2)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scour around bridge piers is a critical challenge for infrastructures around the world. In the absence of analytical models and due to the complexity of the scour process, it is difficult for current empirical methods to achieve accurate predictions. In this paper, we exploit the power of deep learning algorithms to forecast the scour depth variations around bridge piers based on historical sensor monitoring data, including riverbed elevation, flow elevation, and flow velocity. We investigated the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time scour forecasting using data collected from bridges in Alaska and Oregon from 2006 to 2021. The LSTM models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.1m to 0.5m for predicting bed level variations a week in advance, showing a reasonable performance. The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) variant of CNN outperformed other CNN configurations, showing a comparable performance to LSTMs with significantly lower computational costs. We explored various innovative random-search heuristics for hyperparameter tuning and model optimisation which resulted in reduced computational cost compared to grid-search method. The impact of different combinations of sensor features on scour prediction showed the significance of the historical time series of scour for predicting upcoming events. Overall, this study provides a greater understanding of the potential of Deep Learning algorithms for real-time scour prediction and early warning for bridges with distinct geology, geomorphology and flow characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Time Series Foundation Models: Generalizing Time Series Representation with Large Language Mode](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02358v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across various domains, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely \textbf{pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series} and \textbf{adapting large language foundation models for time series}. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis. This survey offers a 3E analytical framework for comprehensive examination of related research. Specifically, we examine existing works from three dimensions, namely \textbf{Effectiveness}, \textbf{Efficiency} and \textbf{Explainability}. In each dimension, we focus on discussing how related works devise tailored solution by considering unique challenges in the realm of time series.Furthermore, we provide a domain taxonomy to help followers keep up with the domain-specific advancements. In addition, we introduce extensive resources to facilitate the field's development, including datasets, open-source, time series libraries.

| **[Adaptive deep learning for nonlinear time series models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02546v3)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a general theory for adaptive nonparametric estimation of the mean function of a non-stationary and nonlinear time series model using deep neural networks (DNNs). We first consider two types of DNN estimators, non-penalized and sparse-penalized DNN estimators, and establish their generalization error bounds for general non-stationary time series. We then derive minimax lower bounds for estimating mean functions belonging to a wide class of nonlinear autoregressive (AR) models that include nonlinear generalized additive AR, single index, and threshold AR models. Building upon the results, we show that the sparse-penalized DNN estimator is adaptive and attains the minimax optimal rates up to a poly-logarithmic factor for many nonlinear AR models. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the usefulness of the DNN methods for estimating nonlinear AR models with intrinsic low-dimensional structures and discontinuous or rough mean functions, which is consistent with our theory.</p></details> | 49 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Interpretable Vital Sign Forecasting with Model Agnostic Attention Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01714v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), representing a substantial medical challenge. The complexity of analyzing diverse vital signs to predict sepsis further aggravates this issue. While deep learning techniques have been advanced for early sepsis prediction, their 'black-box' nature obscures the internal logic, impairing interpretability in critical settings like ICUs. This paper introduces a framework that combines a deep learning model with an attention mechanism that highlights the critical time steps in the forecasting process, thus improving model interpretability and supporting clinical decision-making. We show that the attention mechanism could be adapted to various black box time series forecasting models such as N-HiTS and N-BEATS. Our method preserves the accuracy of conventional deep learning models while enhancing interpretability through attention-weight-generated heatmaps. We evaluated our model on the eICU-CRD dataset, focusing on forecasting vital signs for sepsis patients. We assessed its performance using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW) metrics. We explored the attention maps of N-HiTS and N-BEATS, examining the differences in their performance and identifying crucial factors influencing vital sign forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, training models for SITS segmentation remains a challenging task due to the lack of abundant training data, which requires fine grained annotation. We propose S4 a new self-supervised pre-training approach that significantly reduces the requirement for labeled training data by utilizing two new insights: (a) Satellites capture images in different parts of the spectrum such as radio frequencies, and visible frequencies. (b) Satellite imagery is geo-registered allowing for fine-grained spatial alignment. We use these insights to formulate pre-training tasks in S4. We also curate m2s2-SITS, a large-scale dataset of unlabeled, spatially-aligned, multi-modal and geographic specific SITS that serves as representative pre-training data for S4. Finally, we evaluate S4 on multiple SITS segmentation datasets and demonstrate its efficacy against competing baselines while using limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and model checkpoints available at https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose PACE (PAttern-based user Consumption Embedding), a framework for building user embeddings that takes advantage of periodic listening behaviors. PACE leverages users' multichannel time-series consumption patterns to build understandable user vectors. We believe the embeddings learned with PACE unveil much about the repetitive nature of user listening dynamics. By applying this framework on long-term user histories, we evaluate the embeddings through a predictive task of activities performed while listening to music. The validation task's interest is two-fold, while it shows the relevance of our approach, it also offers an insightful way of understanding users' musical consumption habits.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, CHIIR'24 conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Embed Time Series Patches Independently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16427v4)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked time series modeling has recently gained much attention as a self-supervised representation learning strategy for time series. Inspired by masked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and partially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the dependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked patches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be an optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning to embed patches independently results in better time series representations. Specifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which autoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple patch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce complementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time series information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series forecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and training/inference time.

| **[Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01404v4)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron & Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |

Prediction of chaotic time series remains a significant challenge, an area where the conventional reservoir computing framework encounters limitations of prediction accuracy. We introduce an attention mechanism to the reservoir computing model in the output stage. This attention layer is designed to prioritize distinct features and temporal sequences, thereby substantially enhancing the prediction accuracy. Our results show that a photonic reservoir computer enhanced with the attention mechanism exhibits improved prediction capabilities for smaller reservoirs. These advancements highlight the transformative possibilities of reservoir computing for practical applications where accurate prediction of chaotic time series is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wildfire Risk Prediction: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01607v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wildfires have significant impacts on global vegetation, wildlife, and humans. They destroy plant communities and wildlife habitats and contribute to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and other pollutants. The prediction of wildfires relies on various independent variables combined with regression or machine learning methods. In this technical review, we describe the options for independent variables, data processing techniques, models, independent variables collinearity and importance estimation methods, and model performance evaluation metrics. First, we divide the independent variables into 4 aspects, including climate and meteorology conditions, socio-economical factors, terrain and hydrological features, and wildfire historical records. Second, preprocessing methods are described for different magnitudes, different spatial-temporal resolutions, and different formats of data. Third, the collinearity and importance evaluation methods of independent variables are also considered. Fourth, we discuss the application of statistical models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in wildfire risk prediction. In this subsection, compared with other reviews, this manuscript particularly discusses the evaluation metrics and recent advancements in deep learning methods. Lastly, addressing the limitations of current research, this paper emphasizes the need for more effective deep learning time series forecasting algorithms, the utilization of three-dimensional data including ground and trunk fuel, extraction of more accurate historical fire point data, and improved model evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than 1k parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data.

| **[MTDT: A Multi-Task Deep Learning Digital Twin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00922v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion has significant impacts on both the economy and the environment. Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) have long been the standard for evaluating the level of service and operational efficiency of traffic intersections. However, the scarcity of traditional high-resolution loop detector data (ATSPM) presents challenges in accurately measuring MOEs or capturing the intricate temporospatial characteristics inherent in urban intersection traffic. In response to this challenge, we have introduced the Multi-Task Deep Learning Digital Twin (MTDT) as a solution for multifaceted and precise intersection traffic flow simulation. MTDT enables accurate, fine-grained estimation of loop detector waveform time series for each lane of movement, alongside successful estimation of several MOEs for each lane group associated with a traffic phase concurrently and for all approaches of an arbitrary urban intersection. Unlike existing deep learning methodologies, MTDT distinguishes itself through its adaptability to local temporal and spatial features, such as signal timing plans, intersection topology, driving behaviors, and turning movement counts. While maintaining a straightforward design, our model emphasizes the advantages of multi-task learning in traffic modeling. By consolidating the learning process across multiple tasks, MTDT demonstrates reduced overfitting, increased efficiency, and enhanced effectiveness by sharing representations learned by different tasks. Furthermore, our approach facilitates sequential computation and lends itself to complete parallelization through GPU implementation. This not only streamlines the computational process but also enhances scalability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Leveraging these bounds, we propose semiparametric mean and variance joint (MVJ) models utilizing a clipped-Laplace link function. These models offer a flexible and feasible structure for both mean and variance, accommodating various scenarios of under-dispersion, equi-dispersion, or over-dispersion in bounded time series. The proposed MVJ models feature a linear mean structure with positive regression coefficients summing to one and allow for negative regression cefficients and autocorrelations. We demonstrate that the autocorrelation structure of MVJ models mirrors that of an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) process, provided the proposed clipped-Laplace link functions with nonnegative regression coefficients summing to one are utilized. We establish conditions ensuring the stationarity and ergodicity properties of the MVJ process, along with demonstrating the consistency and asymptotic normality of the conditional least squares estimators. To aid model selection and diagnostics, we introduce two model selection criteria and apply two model diagnostics statistics. Finally, we conduct simulations and real data analyses to investigate the finite-sample properties of the proposed MVJ models, providing insights into their efficacy and applicability in practical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.18421</p></details> |
| **[Mixture-of-Linear-Experts for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06786v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future values of a time series given the past values. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on this problem is attained in some cases by linear-centric models, which primarily feature a linear mapping layer. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they are not able to adapt their prediction rules to periodic changes in time series patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts-style augmentation for linear-centric models and propose Mixture-of-Linear-Experts (MoLE). Instead of training a single model, MoLE trains multiple linear-centric models (i.e., experts) and a router model that weighs and mixes their outputs. While the entire framework is trained end-to-end, each expert learns to specialize in a specific temporal pattern, and the router model learns to compose the experts adaptively. Experiments show that MoLE reduces forecasting error of linear-centric models, including DLinear, RLinear, and RMLP, in over 78% of the datasets and settings we evaluated. By using MoLE existing linear-centric models can achieve SOTA LTSF results in 68% of the experiments that PatchTST reports and we compare to, whereas existing single-head linear-centric models achieve SOTA results in only 25% of cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARMA: Scalable Low-Rank High-Dimensional Autoregressive Moving Averages via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00626v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing models for high-dimensional time series are overwhelmingly developed within the finite-order vector autoregressive (VAR) framework, whereas the more flexible vector autoregressive moving averages (VARMA) have been much less considered. This paper introduces a high-dimensional model for capturing VARMA dynamics, namely the Scalable ARMA (SARMA) model, by combining novel reparameterization and tensor decomposition techniques. To ensure identifiability and computational tractability, we first consider a reparameterization of the VARMA model and discover that this interestingly amounts to a Tucker-low-rank structure for the AR coefficient tensor along the temporal dimension. Motivated by this finding, we further consider Tucker decomposition across the response and predictor dimensions of the AR coefficient tensor, enabling factor extraction across variables and time lags. Additionally, we consider sparsity assumptions on the factor loadings to accomplish automatic variable selection and greater estimation efficiency. For the proposed model, we develop both rank-constrained and sparsity-inducing estimators. Algorithms and model selection methods are also provided. Simulation studies and empirical examples confirm the validity of our theory and advantages of our approaches over existing competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separation capacity of linear reservoirs with random connectivity matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17429v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that the success of reservoir computing lies within the separation capacity of the reservoirs and show that the expected separation capacity of random linear reservoirs is fully characterised by the spectral decomposition of an associated generalised matrix of moments. Of particular interest are reservoirs with Gaussian matrices that are either symmetric or whose entries are all independent. In the symmetric case, we prove that the separation capacity always deteriorates with time; while for short inputs, separation with large reservoirs is best achieved when the entries of the matrix are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the dimension of the reservoir and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum length of the input time series. In the i.i.d. case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation in function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and the impact of the chosen architecture on separation consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Volume-Preserving Transformers for Learning Time Series Data with Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11166v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the many trends in neural network research of the past few years have been (i) the learning of dynamical systems, especially with recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and (ii) the introduction of transformer neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Both of these trends have created enormous amounts of traction, particularly the second one: transformer networks now dominate the field of NLP. Even though some work has been performed on the intersection of these two trends, those efforts was largely limited to using the vanilla transformer directly without adjusting its architecture for the setting of a physical system. In this work we use a transformer-inspired neural network to learn a dynamical system and furthermore (for the first time) imbue it with structure-preserving properties to improve long-term stability. This is shown to be of great advantage when applying the neural network to real world applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite their potential, current research on cryptocurrency trend forecasting often falls short by simplistically merging sentiment data without fully considering the nuanced interplay between financial market dynamics and external sentiment influences. This paper presents a novel Dual Attention Mechanism (DAM) for forecasting cryptocurrency trends using multimodal time-series data. Our approach, which integrates critical cryptocurrency metrics with sentiment data from news and social media analyzed through CryptoBERT, addresses the inherent volatility and prediction challenges in cryptocurrency markets. By combining elements of distributed systems, natural language processing, and financial forecasting, our method outperforms conventional models like LSTM and Transformer by up to 20\% in prediction accuracy. This advancement deepens the understanding of distributed systems and has practical implications in financial markets, benefiting stakeholders in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Moreover, our enhanced forecasting approach can significantly support decentralized science (DeSci) by facilitating strategic planning and the efficient adoption of blockchain technologies, improving operational efficiency and financial risk management in the rapidly evolving digital asset domain, thus ensuring optimal resource allocation.</p></details> |  |

Its efficacy is established through testing on synthetic signals, such as uncorrelated and correlated noise, showcasing its adeptness in discerning various levels of dependency and complexity. The robustness of mvDEG is further validated with real-world datasets, effectively differentiating various two-phase flow regimes and capturing distinct dynamics in weather data analysis. An important advancement of mvDEG is its computational efficiency. Our optimized algorithm displays a computational time that grows linearly with the number of vertices or nodes, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in classical methods. This efficiency is achieved through refined matrix power calculations that exploit matrix and Kronecker product properties, making our method faster than the state of the art. The significant acceleration in computational time positions mvDEG as a transformative tool for extensive and real-time applications, setting a new benchmark in the analysis of time series recorded at distributed locations and opening avenues for innovative applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Directed Redundancy in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00368v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We quantify the average amount of redundant information that is transferred from a subset of relevant random source processes to a target process. To identify the relevant source processes, we consider those that are connected to the target process and in addition share a certain proportion of the total information causally provided to the target. Even if the relevant processes have no directed information exchange between them, they can still causally provide redundant information to the target. This makes it difficult to identify the relevant processes. To solve this issue, we propose the existence of a hidden redundancy process that governs the shared information among the relevant processes. We bound the redundancy by the minimal average directed redundancy from the relevant processes to the target, from the hidden redundancy process to the target, and from the hidden redundancy process to the relevant processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory 2024</p></details> |

While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Extreme Modeling for Point-to-Area Random Effects (PARE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17271v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One measurement modality for rainfall is a fixed location rain gauge. However, extreme rainfall, flooding, and other climate extremes often occur at larger spatial scales and affect more than one location in a community. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey impacted all of Houston and the surrounding region causing widespread flooding. Flood risk modeling requires understanding of rainfall for hydrologic regions, which may contain one or more rain gauges. Further, policy changes to address the risks and damages of natural hazards such as severe flooding are usually made at the community/neighborhood level or higher geo-spatial scale. Therefore, spatial-temporal methods which convert results from one spatial scale to another are especially useful in applications for evolving environmental extremes. We develop a point-to-area random effects (PARE) modeling strategy for understanding spatial-temporal extreme values at the areal level, when the core information are time series at point locations distributed over the region.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

The framework identifies and characterizes inter-subject similarities and differences between two pre-determined groups by considering a combination of group spatial information and individual temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it enables the identification of intra-subject similarities and differences over time by employing different model configurations for each subject. Methodologically, the framework combines a novel principal angle-based rank selection algorithm and a non-iterative integrative analysis framework. Inspired by simultaneous component analysis, this approach also reconstructs identifiable latent factor series with flexible covariance structures. The performance of the GRIDY models is evaluated through simulations conducted under various scenarios. An application is also presented to compare resting-state functional MRI data collected from multiple subjects in autism spectrum disorder and control groups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Discovery from Time Series with Hybrids of Constraint-Based and Noise-Based Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08765v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint-based methods and noise-based methods are two distinct families of methods proposed for uncovering causal graphs from observational data. However, both operate under strong assumptions that may be challenging to validate or could be violated in real-world scenarios. In response to these challenges, there is a growing interest in hybrid methods that amalgamate principles from both methods, showing robustness to assumption violations. This paper introduces a novel comprehensive framework for hybridizing constraint-based and noise-based methods designed to uncover causal graphs from observational time series. The framework is structured into two classes. The first class employs a noise-based strategy to identify a super graph, containing the true graph, followed by a constraint-based strategy to eliminate unnecessary edges. In the second class, a constraint-based strategy is applied to identify a skeleton, which is then oriented using a noise-based strategy. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for each class under the condition that all assumptions are satisfied, and it outlines some properties when assumptions are violated. To validate the efficacy of the framework, two algorithms from each class are experimentally tested on simulated data, realistic ecological data, and real datasets sourced from diverse applications. Notably, two novel datasets related to Information Technology monitoring are introduced within the set of considered real datasets. The experimental results underscore the robustness and effectiveness of the hybrid approaches across a broad spectrum of datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in TMLR: https://openreview.net/forum?id=PGLbZpVk2n</p></details> |
| **[Regularized Estimation of Sparse Spectral Precision Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11128v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral precision matrix, the inverse of a spectral density matrix, is an object of central interest in frequency-domain analysis of multivariate time series. Estimation of spectral precision matrix is a key step in calculating partial coherency and graphical model selection of stationary time series. When the dimension of a multivariate time series is moderate to large, traditional estimators of spectral density matrices such as averaged periodograms tend to be severely ill-conditioned, and one needs to resort to suitable regularization strategies involving optimization over complex variables. In this work, we propose complex graphical Lasso (CGLASSO), an $\ell_1$-penalized estimator of spectral precision matrix based on local Whittle likelihood maximization. We develop fast $\textit{pathwise coordinate descent}$ algorithms for implementing CGLASSO on large dimensional time series data sets. At its core, our algorithmic development relies on a ring isomorphism between complex and real matrices that helps map a number of optimization problems over complex variables to similar optimization problems over real variables. This finding may be of independent interest and more broadly applicable for high-dimensional statistical analysis with complex-valued data. We also present a complete non-asymptotic theory of our proposed estimator which shows that consistent estimation is possible in high-dimensional regime as long as the underlying spectral precision matrix is suitably sparse. We compare the performance of CGLASSO with competing alternatives on simulated data sets, and use it to construct partial coherence network among brain regions from a real fMRI data set.</p></details> | 55 pages, 8 figures |

Yet, the proliferation of more diverse time series data, coupled with the expanding landscape of available forecasting methods, poses significant challenges for forecasters. To meet the growing demand for efficient forecasting, we introduce auto-sktime, a novel framework for automated time series forecasting. The proposed framework uses the power of automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to automate the creation of the entire forecasting pipeline. The framework employs Bayesian optimization, to automatically construct pipelines from statistical, machine learning (ML) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Furthermore, we propose three essential improvements to adapt AutoML to time series data. First, pipeline templates to account for the different supported forecasting models. Second, a novel warm-starting technique to start the optimization from prior optimization runs. Third, we adapt multi-fidelity optimizations to make them applicable to a search space containing statistical, ML and DNN models. Experimental results on 64 diverse real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework, outperforming traditional methods while requiring minimal human involvement.</p></details> | Accepted at LION18 |

To address this issue, we compare the performance of a foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a baseline Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for missing value imputation in time series of multispectral satellite imagery. We randomly mask time series of satellite images using real-world cloud masks and train each model to reconstruct the missing pixels. The ViT model is fine-tuned from a pretrained model, while the CGAN is trained from scratch. Using quantitative evaluation metrics such as structural similarity index and mean absolute error as well as qualitative visual analysis, we assess imputation accuracy and contextual preservation.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce the Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation (TG-ODE) framework, which learns both the temporal and spatial dynamics from graph streams where the intervals between observations are not regularly spaced. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several graph benchmarks, showing that TG-ODE can achieve state-of-the-art performance in irregular graph stream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Evaluating ROCKET and Catch22 features for calf behaviour classification from accelerometer data using Machine Learning models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18159v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring calf behaviour continuously would be beneficial to identify routine practices (e.g., weaning, dehorning, etc.) that impact calf welfare in dairy farms. In that regard, accelerometer data collected from neck collars can be used along with Machine Learning models to classify calf behaviour automatically. Hand-crafted features are commonly used in Machine Learning models, while ROCKET and Catch22 features are specifically designed for time-series classification problems in related fields. This study aims to compare the performance of ROCKET and Catch22 features to Hand-Crafted features. 30 Irish Holstein Friesian and Jersey pre-weaned calves were monitored using accelerometer sensors allowing for 27.4 hours of annotated behaviors. Additional time-series were computed from the raw X, Y and Z-axis and split into 3-second time windows. ROCKET, Catch22 and Hand-Crafted features were calculated for each time window, and the dataset was then split into the train, validation and test sets. Each set of features was used to train three Machine Learning models (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and RidgeClassifierCV) to classify six behaviours indicative of pre-weaned calf welfare (drinking milk, grooming, lying, running, walking and other). Models were tuned with the validation set, and the performance of each feature-model combination was evaluated with the test set. The best performance across the three models was obtained with ROCKET [average balanced accuracy +/- standard deviation] (0.70 +/- 0.07), followed by Catch22 (0.69 +/- 0.05), surpassing Hand-Crafted (0.65 +/- 0.034). The best balanced accuracy (0.77) was obtained with ROCKET and RidgeClassifierCV, followed by Catch22 and Random Forest (0.73). Thus, tailoring these approaches for specific behaviours and contexts will be crucial in advancing precision livestock farming and enhancing animal welfare on a larger scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables (3 in the Appendix), Journal paper</p></details> |
| **[BrainODE: Dynamic Brain Signal Analysis via Graph-Aided Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00077v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain network analysis is vital for understanding the neural interactions regarding brain structures and functions, and identifying potential biomarkers for clinical phenotypes. However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Human Trust Modeling of Autonomous Agents With Varying Capability and Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19291v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective We model the dynamic trust of human subjects in a human-autonomy-teaming screen-based task. Background Trust is an emerging area of study in human-robot collaboration. Many studies have looked at the issue of robot performance as a sole predictor of human trust, but this could underestimate the complexity of the interaction. Method Subjects were paired with autonomous agents to search an on-screen grid to determine the number of outlier objects. In each trial, a different autonomous agent with a preassigned capability used one of three search strategies and then reported the number of outliers it found as a fraction of its capability. Then, the subject reported their total outlier estimate. Human subjects then evaluated statements about the agent's behavior, reliability, and their trust in the agent. Results 80 subjects were recruited. Self-reported trust was modeled using Ordinary Least Squares, but the group that interacted with varying capability agents on a short time order produced a better performing ARIMAX model. Models were cross-validated between groups and found a moderate improvement in the next trial trust prediction. Conclusion A time series modeling approach reveals the effects of temporal ordering of agent performance on estimated trust. Recency bias may affect how subjects weigh the contribution of strategy or capability to trust. Understanding the connections between agent behavior, agent performance, and human trust is crucial to improving human-robot collaborative tasks. Application The modeling approach in this study demonstrates the need to represent autonomous agent characteristics over time to capture changes in human trust.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-occurrence order-preserving pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19243v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, order-preserving pattern (OPP) mining has been proposed to discover some patterns, which can be seen as trend changes in time series. Although existing OPP mining algorithms have achieved satisfactory performance, they discover all frequent patterns. However, in some cases, users focus on a particular trend and its associated trends. To efficiently discover trend information related to a specific prefix pattern, this paper addresses the issue of co-occurrence OPP mining (COP) and proposes an algorithm named COP-Miner to discover COPs from historical time series. COP-Miner consists of three parts: extracting keypoints, preparation stage, and iteratively calculating supports and mining frequent COPs. Extracting keypoints is used to obtain local extreme points of patterns and time series. The preparation stage is designed to prepare for the first round of mining, which contains four steps: obtaining the suffix OPP of the keypoint sub-time series, calculating the occurrences of the suffix OPP, verifying the occurrences of the keypoint sub-time series, and calculating the occurrences of all fusion patterns of the keypoint sub-time series. To further improve the efficiency of support calculation, we propose a support calculation method with an ending strategy that uses the occurrences of prefix and suffix patterns to calculate the occurrences of superpatterns. Experimental results indicate that COP-Miner outperforms the other competing algorithms in running time and scalability. Moreover, COPs with keypoint alignment yield better prediction performance.</p></details> |  |

Esports broadcasting involves game expert casters, but the caster-dependent game commentary is not enough to fully understand the game situation. It will be richer by including diverse multimodal esports information, including audiences' talks/emotions, game audio, and game match event information. This paper introduces GAME-MUG, a new multimodal game situation understanding and audience-engaged commentary generation dataset and its strong baseline. Our dataset is collected from 2020-2022 LOL game live streams from YouTube and Twitch, and includes multimodal esports game information, including text, audio, and time-series event logs, for detecting the game situation. In addition, we also propose a new audience conversation augmented commentary dataset by covering the game situation and audience conversation understanding, and introducing a robust joint multimodal dual learning model as a baseline. We examine the model's game situation/event understanding ability and commentary generation capability to show the effectiveness of the multimodal aspects coverage and the joint integration learning approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterising Payload Entropy in Packet Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19121v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely detection of cyber threats is critical to keeping our online economy and data safe. A key technique in early detection is the classification of unusual patterns of network behaviour, often hidden as low-frequency events within complex time-series packet flows. One of the ways in which such anomalies can be detected is to analyse the information entropy of the payload within individual packets, since changes in entropy can often indicate suspicious activity - such as whether session encryption has been compromised, or whether a plaintext channel has been co-opted as a covert channel. To decide whether activity is anomalous we need to compare real-time entropy values with baseline values, and while the analysis of entropy in packet data is not particularly new, to the best of our knowledge there are no published baselines for payload entropy across common network services. We offer two contributions: 1) We analyse several large packet datasets to establish baseline payload information entropy values for common network services, 2) We describe an efficient method for engineering entropy metrics when performing flow recovery from live or offline packet data, which can be expressed within feature subsets for subsequent analysis and machine learning applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

All past work on high-dimensional matrix graphical models assumes that independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations of the matrix-variate are available. Here we allow dependent observations. We consider a sparse-group lasso-based frequency-domain formulation of the problem with a Kronecker-decomposable power spectral density (PSD), and solve it via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. The problem is bi-convex which is solved via flip-flop optimization. We provide sufficient conditions for local convergence in the Frobenius norm of the inverse PSD estimators to the true value. This result also yields a rate of convergence. We illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17992v3)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) methods for structural metamodeling due to the substantial computational cost of traditional simulations. Purely data-driven strategies often face limitations in model robustness, interpretability, and dependency on extensive data. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method that integrates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks to model seismic responses of nonlinear structures. The approach constrains the ML model's solution space within known physical bounds through three main features: dimensionality reduction via combined model order reduction and wavelet analysis, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Newton's second law. Dimensionality reduction addresses structural systems' redundancy and boosts efficiency while extracting essential features through wavelet analysis. LSTM networks capture temporal dependencies for accurate time-series predictions. Manipulating the equation of motion helps learn system nonlinearities and confines solutions within physically interpretable results. These attributes allow for model training with sparse data, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Furthermore, a dataset of archetype steel moment resistant frames under seismic loading, available in the DesignSafe-CI Database [1], is considered for evaluation. The resulting metamodel handles complex data better than existing physics-guided LSTM models and outperforms other non-physics data-driven networks.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

The development of an integrated many-to-many framework that leverages multiple data modality inputs for the analytical modeling of multiple medical tasks, is critical for a unified understanding of modern medicine. In this work, we introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning from diverse multimodal inputs across a broad spectrum of medical task categories and machine learning problem classes. The modular design of the framework ensures its generalizable data processing, task definition, and rapid model prototyping, applicable to both clinical and operational healthcare settings. We evaluate the M3H framework by validating models trained from four modalities (tabular, time-series, language, and vision) on 41 medical tasks across 4 machine learning problem classes. Our results demonstrate that M3H consistently produces multitask models that outperform canonical single-task models (by 1.1- 37.2%) across 37 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments, three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task: spanning ML problem classes of supervised binary classification, multiclass classification, regression, and clustering. Additionally, the framework introduces a novel attention mechanism to balance self-exploitation (focus on learning source task), and cross-exploration (encourage learning from other tasks). Furthermore, M3H provides explainability insights on how joint learning of additional tasks impacts the learning of source task using a proposed TIM score, shedding light into the dynamics of task interdependencies. Its adaptable architecture facilitates the customization and integration, establishing it as a robust and scalable candidate solution for future AI-driven healthcare systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-way Homogeneity Pursuit for Quantile Network Vector Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18732v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model has received extensive attention for modelling complex time series, quantile VAR analysis remains relatively underexplored for high-dimensional time series data. To address this disparity, we introduce a two-way grouped network quantile (TGNQ) autoregression model for time series collected on large-scale networks, known for their significant heterogeneous and directional interactions among nodes. Our proposed model simultaneously conducts node clustering and model estimation to balance complexity and interpretability. To account for the directional influence among network nodes, each network node is assigned two latent group memberships that can be consistently estimated using our proposed estimation procedure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the consistency of membership and parameter estimators even with an overspecified number of groups. With the correct group specification, estimated parameters are proven to be asymptotically normal, enabling valid statistical inferences. Moreover, we propose a quantile information criterion for consistently selecting the number of groups. Simulation studies show promising finite sample performance, and we apply the methodology to analyze connectedness and risk spillover effects among Chinese A-share stocks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CVTN: Cross Variable and Temporal Integration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18730v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series forecasting, the Transformer architecture encounters two significant challenges: effectively mining features from historical sequences and avoiding overfitting during the learning of temporal dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper deconstructs time series forecasting into the learning of historical sequences and prediction sequences, introducing the Cross-Variable and Time Network (CVTN). This unique method divides multivariate time series forecasting into two phases: cross-variable learning for effectively mining fea tures from historical sequences, and cross-time learning to capture the temporal dependencies of prediction sequences. Separating these two phases helps avoid the impact of overfitting in cross-time learning on cross-variable learning. Exten sive experiments on various real-world datasets have confirmed its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. CVTN emphasizes three key dimensions in time series fore casting: the short-term and long-term nature of time series (locality and longevity), feature mining from both historical and prediction sequences, and the integration of cross-variable and cross-time learning. This approach not only advances the current state of time series forecasting but also provides a more comprehensive framework for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

We propose a prediction-based detection method for finding highway traffic anomalies using reconciled ordinary least squares (OLS) forecasts and bootstrap prediction intervals. Two fundamental features of traffic flow time series -- namely, seasonality and spatial autocorrelation -- are captured by adding Fourier terms in OLS models, spatial aggregation (as a hierarchical structure mimicking the geographical division in regions, cities, and stations), and a reconciliation step. Our approach, although simple, is able to model complex traffic datasets with reasonable accuracy. Being based on OLS, it is efficient and permits avoiding the computational burden of more complex methods. Analyses of Taiwan's consecutive holidays in 2019, 2020, and 2021 (73 days) showed strong variations in anomalies across different directions and highways. Specifically, we detected some areas and highways comprising a high number of traffic anomalies (north direction-central and southern regions-highways No. 1 and 3, south direction-southern region-highway No.3), and others with generally normal traffic (east and west direction). These results could provide important decision-support information to traffic authorities.</p></details> |  |

However, they have continued to rely on the conventional econometric approach for model optimization, optimizing the deep learning models on individual assets. In this paper, we use the stock volatility forecast as an example to illustrate global training - optimizes the deep learning model across a wide range of stocks - is both necessary and beneficial for any academic or industry practitioners who is interested in employing deep learning to forecast financial time series. Furthermore, a pre-trained foundation model for volatility forecast is introduced, capable of making accurate zero-shot forecasts for any stocks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the effectiveness of predicting covariates in LSTM Networks for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18553v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Networks are widely employed in time-series forecasting tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in univariate and certain multivariate scenarios. However, their inherent structure does not readily accommodate the integration of future, time-dependent covariates. A proposed solution, outlined by Salinas et al 2019, suggests forecasting both covariates and the target variable in a multivariate framework. In this study, we conducted comprehensive tests on publicly available time-series datasets, artificially introducing highly correlated covariates to future time-step values. Our evaluation aimed to assess the performance of an LSTM network when considering these covariates and compare it against a univariate baseline. As part of this study we introduce a novel approach using seasonal time segments in combination with an RNN architecture, which is both simple and extremely effective over long forecast horizons with comparable performance to many state of the art architectures. Our findings from the results of more than 120 models reveal that under certain conditions jointly training covariates with target variables can improve overall performance of the model, but often there exists a significant performance disparity between multivariate and univariate predictions. Surprisingly, even when provided with covariates informing the network about future target values, multivariate predictions exhibited inferior performance. In essence, compelling the network to predict multiple values can prove detrimental to model performance, even in the presence of informative covariates. These results suggest that LSTM architectures may not be suitable for forecasting tasks where predicting covariates would typically be expected to enhance model accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 con...</summary><p>9 content pages (22 total pages), 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Time Machine GPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18543v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on extensive, temporally indiscriminate text corpora, reflecting the lack of datasets with temporal metadata. This approach is not aligned with the evolving nature of language. Conventional methods for creating temporally adapted language models often depend on further pre-training static models on time-specific data. This paper presents a new approach: a series of point-in-time LLMs called Time Machine GPT (TiMaGPT), specifically designed to be nonprognosticative. This ensures they remain uninformed about future factual information and linguistic changes. This strategy is beneficial for understanding language evolution and is of critical importance when applying models in dynamic contexts, such as time-series forecasting, where foresight of future information can prove problematic. We provide access to both the models and training datasets.</p></details> | NAACL Findings 2024 |
| **[Time Series Data Augmentation as an Imbalanced Learning Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18537v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods are trained on collections of time series. These methods, often referred to as global models, can capture common patterns in different time series to improve their generalization performance. However, they require large amounts of data that might not be readily available. Besides this, global models sometimes fail to capture relevant patterns unique to a particular time series. In these cases, data augmentation can be useful to increase the sample size of time series datasets. The main contribution of this work is a novel method for generating univariate time series synthetic samples. Our approach stems from the insight that the observations concerning a particular time series of interest represent only a small fraction of all observations. In this context, we frame the problem of training a forecasting model as an imbalanced learning task. Oversampling strategies are popular approaches used to deal with the imbalance problem in machine learning. We use these techniques to create synthetic time series observations and improve the accuracy of forecasting models. We carried out experiments using 7 different databases that contain a total of 5502 univariate time series. We found that the proposed solution outperforms both a global and a local model, thus providing a better trade-off between these two approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often focus on single-image and short-text samples, and when assessing multi-image tasks, they either limit the image count or focus on specific task (e.g time-series captioning), potentially obscuring the performance challenges of MLLMs. To address these limitations, we introduce MileBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to test the MultImodal Long-contExt capabilities of MLLMs. This benchmark comprises not only multimodal long contexts, but also multiple tasks requiring both comprehension and generation. We establish two distinct evaluation sets, diagnostic and realistic, to systematically assess MLLMs' long-context adaptation capacity and their ability to complete tasks in long-context scenarios. Our experimental results, obtained from testing 20 models, revealed that while the closed-source GPT-4(Vision) and Gemini 1.5 outperform others, most open-source MLLMs struggle in long-context situations. Interestingly, the performance gap tends to widen with an increase in the number of images. We strongly encourage an intensification of research efforts towards enhancing MLLMs' long-context capabilities, especially in scenarios involving multiple images.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

However, establishing an anomaly detection system that can be rapidly and accurately located is a challenging problem due to the lack of anomaly labels, the high dimensional complexity of the data, memory bottlenecks in actual hardware, and the need for fast reasoning. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and diagnosis model, DTAAD, based on Transformer and Dual Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Our overall model is an integrated design in which an autoregressive model (AR) combines with an autoencoder (AE) structure. Scaling methods and feedback mechanisms are introduced to improve prediction accuracy and expand correlation differences. Constructed by us, the Dual TCN-Attention Network (DTA) uses only a single layer of Transformer encoder in our baseline experiment, belonging to an ultra-lightweight model. Our extensive experiments on seven public datasets validate that DTAAD exceeds the majority of currently advanced baseline methods in both detection and diagnostic performance. Specifically, DTAAD improved F1 scores by $8.38\%$ and reduced training time by $99\%$ compared to the baseline. The code and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Yu-Lingrui/DTAAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Sparse Vector Autoregressive Switching Models with Application to Human Gesture Phase Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05347v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) for modeling temporal and contemporaneous (e.g. spatial) dependencies in multivariate nonstationary time series. The HSMM's generic state distribution is embedded in a special transition matrix structure, facilitating efficient likelihood evaluations and arbitrary approximation accuracy. To promote sparsity of the VAR coefficients, we deploy an $l_1$-ball projection prior, which combines differentiability with a positive probability of obtaining exact zeros, achieving variable selection within each switching state. This also facilitates posterior estimation via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We further place non-local priors on the parameters of the HSMM dwell distribution improving the ability of Bayesian model selection to distinguish whether the data is better supported by the simpler hidden Markov model (HMM), or the more flexible HSMM. Our proposed methodology is illustrated via an application to human gesture phase segmentation based on sensor data, where we successfully identify and characterize the periods of rest and active gesturing, as well as the dynamical patterns involved in the gesture movements associated with each of these states.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Semiparametric mean and variance joint models with Laplace link functions for count time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18421v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Count time series data are frequently analyzed by modeling their conditional means and the conditional variance is often considered to be a deterministic function of the corresponding conditional mean and is not typically modeled independently. We propose a semiparametric mean and variance joint model, called random rounded count-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (RRC-GARCH) model, to address this limitation. The RRC-GARCH model and its variations allow for the joint modeling of both the conditional mean and variance and offer a flexible framework for capturing various mean-variance structures (MVSs). One main feature of this model is its ability to accommodate negative values for regression coefficients and autocorrelation functions. The autocorrelation structure of the RRC-GARCH model using the proposed Laplace link functions with nonnegative regression coefficients is the same as that of an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) process. For the new model, the stationarity and ergodicity are established and the consistency and asymptotic normality of the conditional least squares estimator are proved. Model selection criteria are proposed to evaluate the RRC-GARCH models. The performance of the RRC-GARCH model is assessed through analyses of both simulated and real data sets. The results indicate that the model can effectively capture the MVS of count time series data and generate accurate forecast means and variances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Anomaly Detection in Time Series: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00058v4)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent advances in technology, a wide range of systems continue to collect a large amount of data over time and thus generate time series. Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is an important task in various time-series applications such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, vehicle maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. However, this task is very challenging as it requires considering both the intra-variable dependency and the inter-variable dependency, where a variable can be defined as an observation in time-series data. Recent graph-based approaches have made impressive progress in tackling the challenges of this field. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of TSAD using graphs, referred to as G-TSAD.

For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.</p></details> | under review |
| **[AdaFSNet: Time Series Classification Based on Convolutional Network with a Adaptive and Effective Kernel Size Configuration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18246v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is one of the most critical and challenging problems in data mining, existing widely in various fields and holding significant research importance. Despite extensive research and notable achievements with successful real-world applications, addressing the challenge of capturing the appropriate receptive field (RF) size from one-dimensional or multi-dimensional time series of varying lengths remains a persistent issue, which greatly impacts performance and varies considerably across different datasets. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive and Effective Full-Scope Convolutional Neural Network (AdaFSNet) to enhance the accuracy of time series classification. This network includes two Dense Blocks. Particularly, it can dynamically choose a range of kernel sizes that effectively encompass the optimal RF size for various datasets by incorporating multiple prime numbers corresponding to the time series length. We also design a TargetDrop block, which can reduce redundancy while extracting a more effective RF. To assess the effectiveness of the AdaFSNet network, comprehensive experiments were conducted using the UCR and UEA datasets, which include one-dimensional and multi-dimensional time series data, respectively. Our model surpassed baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, underscoring the AdaFSNet network's efficiency and effectiveness in handling time series classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2024</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of spatiotemporal series remains challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, current end-to-end models are limited by input length and thus often fall into spatiotemporal mirage, i.e., similar input time series followed by dissimilar future values and vice versa. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training framework Spatial-Temporal-Decoupled Masked Pre-training (STD-MAE) that employs two decoupled masked autoencoders to reconstruct spatiotemporal series along the spatial and temporal dimensions. Rich-context representations learned through such reconstruction could be seamlessly integrated by downstream predictors with arbitrary architectures to augment their performances. A series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations on six widely used benchmarks (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08, METR-LA, and PEMS-BAY) are conducted to validate the state-of-the-art performance of STD-MAE. Codes are available at https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/STD-MAE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI-2024 Main Track</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unscented Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02753v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans. This performance underscores the model's unparalleled adaptability and efficacy in navigating complex traffic scenarios, including highways, urban streets, and intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

The model, termed MFTraj, harnesses historical trajectory data combined with a novel dynamic geometric graph-based behavior-aware module. At its core, an adaptive structure-aware interactive graph convolutional network captures both positional and behavioral features of road users, preserving spatial-temporal intricacies. Enhanced by a linear attention mechanism, the model achieves computational efficiency and reduced parameter overhead. Evaluations on the Argoverse, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets underscore MFTraj's robustness and adaptability, outperforming numerous benchmarks even in data-challenged scenarios without the need for additional information such as HD maps or vectorized maps. Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models.

| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v3)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties.The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17%, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times.

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms. The code will be released at https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Implicit-SVSDF-Planner for the benefit of the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>accec...</summary><p>accecpted by SIGGRAPH2024&TOG.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/G2LTraj.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01658v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |

The agent's goal is to explore the environment and gather information subject to its resource constraints in unknown, partially observable environments. The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50%. This approach was developed in support of rover path planning for the NASA VIPER Mission.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies</p></details> |

However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |

It represents a significant leap forward, achieving marked performance improvements on several key datasets. Specifically, it surpasses existing benchmarks with gains of 16.2% on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), 27.4% on the Highway Drone (HighD), and 19.8% on the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset. Our proposed model shows exceptional proficiency in handling corner cases, essential for real-world applications. Moreover, its robustness is evident in scenarios with missing or limited data, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art baselines. This adaptability and resilience position our model as a viable tool for real-world autonomous driving systems, heralding a new standard in vehicle trajectory prediction for enhanced safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset. The proposed method demonstrates slight advantages in clustering and strong advantages in runtime, especially for long trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2023 IEEE-RAS 22nd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids).

Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |

This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies.

They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles.

However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory-based alignment, typically modeled as a classic hand-eye calibration, significantly influences the accuracy of evaluation metrics. However, traditional calibration methods are susceptible to the quality of the input poses. Few studies have taken this into account when evaluating VO/VIO trajectories that usually suffer from noise and drift. To fill this gap, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hand-eye calibration algorithm that fully leverages multiple constraints from screw theory for enhanced accuracy and robustness.

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Numerous methods exist that target different tasks involving trajectories such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. However, most methods target only one specific task and cannot be applied universally. Existing efforts to create a universal trajectory model often involve adding prediction modules for adapting to different tasks, while also struggle with incomplete or sparse trajectories. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM) designed to support different tasks based on incomplete or sparse trajectories without the need for retraining or extra prediction modules. To addresses task adaptability on incomplete trajectories, UVTM divide the spatio-temporal features of trajectories into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to suit the input and output needs of specific tasks. To handle sparse trajectories effectively, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing densely sampled trajectories from sparsely sampled ones, allowing it to extract detailed spatio-temporal information from sparse trajectories. Experiments involving three representative trajectory-related tasks on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the intended properties performance of UVTM and offer evidence that UVTM is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |

These data offer us vital insights to understand the movements of individuals and populations, benefiting a broad range of applications from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, improper release of trajectory data is increasing concerns on individual privacy. Previous attempts either lack strong privacy guarantees, or fail to preserve sufficient basic characteristics of the original data. In this paper, we propose DPTraj-PM, a method to synthesize trajectory dataset under the differential privacy (DP) framework while ensures high data utility. Based on the assumption that an individual's trajectory could be mainly determined by the initial trajectory segment (which depicts the starting point and the initial direction) and the next location point, DPTraj-PM discretizes the raw trajectories into neighboring cells, and models them by combining a prefix tree structure and an m-order Markov process. After adding noise to the model under differential privacy, DPTraj-PM generates a synthetic dataset from the noisy model to enable a wider spectrum of data mining and modeling tasks. The output traces crafted by DPTraj-PM not only preserves the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors, but also protects individual privacy. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DPTraj-PM substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of data utility.

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a $\textit{direct multiple shooting technique}$ -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce and make freely available a new software package developed based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with its functionalities to make the article complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted; 35 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[On the Trajectories of SGD Without Replacement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16143v2)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article examines the implicit regularization effect of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |

Current research predominantly focuses on traditional deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These methods leverage relative distances to forecast the motion trajectories of a single class of agents. However, in complex traffic scenarios, the motion patterns of various types of traffic participants exhibit inherent randomness and uncertainty. Relying solely on relative distances may not adequately capture the nuanced interaction patterns between different classes of road users. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class trajectory prediction method named the social force embedded mixed graph convolutional network (SFEM-GCN). SFEM-GCN comprises three graph topologies: the semantic graph (SG), position graph (PG), and velocity graph (VG). These graphs encode various of social force relationships among different classes of agents in complex scenes. Specifically, SG utilizes one-hot encoding of agent-class information to guide the construction of graph adjacency matrices based on semantic information. PG and VG create adjacency matrices to capture motion interaction relationships between different classes agents. These graph structures are then integrated into a mixed graph, where learning is conducted using a spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCNN). To further enhance prediction performance, we adopt temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to generate the predicted trajectory with fewer parameters. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that SFEM-GCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,3 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent vehicles</p></details> |

However, imitating trajectories that inadequately represent the original expert data can result in undesirable behaviors, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. We propose a trajectory augmentation method designed to maintain similarity with expert trajectory data. To accomplish this, we first cluster trajectories to identify minority yet safety-critical groups. Then, we combine the trajectories within the same cluster through geometrical transformation to create new trajectories. These trajectories are then added to the training dataset, provided that they meet our specified safety-related criteria. Our experiments exhibit that training an imitation learning model using these augmented trajectories can significantly improve closed-loop performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2024</p></details> |

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 CVPR AICity Workshop</p></details> |

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory prediction models based on the neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous attack methods have achieved high attack success rates but overlook the adaptability to realistic scenarios and the concealment of the deceits. To address this problem, we propose a speed-adaptive stealthy adversarial attack method named SA-Attack. This method searches the sensitive region of trajectory prediction models and generates the adversarial trajectories by using the vehicle-following method and incorporating information about forthcoming trajectories. Our method has the ability to adapt to different speed scenarios by reconstructing the trajectory from scratch. Fusing future trajectory trends and curvature constraints can guarantee the smoothness of adversarial trajectories, further ensuring the stealthiness of attacks. The empirical study on the datasets of nuScenes and Apolloscape demonstrates the attack performance of our proposed method. Finally, we also demonstrate the adaptability and stealthiness of SA-Attack for different speed scenarios.

The system utilizes information presently accessible to customers through smartphones and retail apps: motion data, store map, and purchase records. The approach eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers maintain full control of their data. Specifically, RetailOpt first employs inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are then cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through systematic experiments in five diverse environments. The proposed system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications, including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation. The potential application could also extend to other domains such as entertainment and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716v5)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajDeleter: Enabling Trajectory Forgetting in Offline Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12530v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent from experiences interacting with the environment. In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | 22 pages |

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version and published in the "Early Access" area of IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles on 16 April 2024.

The motion planning of the proposed robot system presents challenges arising from the nonholonomic constraints of the trailer, system underactuation, and hybrid interaction through the cable. To tackle these challenges, we develop a hybrid dynamics model that accounts for the cable's taut/slack status. Since it is computationally intense to directly optimize the trajectory, we first propose a search algorithm to compute a sub-optimal trajectory as the initial solution. Then, a novel collision avoidance constraint based on the geometric shapes of objects is proposed to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for the hybrid system. The proposed trajectory planning method is implemented on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot with a customized cable-trailer and validated through experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

The field of motion prediction has seen large progress recently with state-of-the-Art (sotA) models achieving impressive results on large-scale public benchmarks. However, recent work revealed that learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be solved by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that leverages a Frenet representation of the scene, and that can be applied to SotA models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a comprehensive benchmark using two SotA motion prediction models. Our experiments show that this reduces the off-road rate on challenging scenarios by more than 90% without sacrificing average performance.</p></details> |  |

To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S4TP) framework. Specifically, S4TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV's planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S4TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs'trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S4TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within lowrisk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S4TP in terms of safety and rationality. S4TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,4 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging. Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information. In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label. We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride. We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands. We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance. Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.

This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators. Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch`s t-test at a significance level of Alpha = 0.05, indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

Despite the recent advances in data-driven approaches, grasping remains an unsolved problem. Most of the works on this task are relying on priors and heavy constraints to avoid the exploration problem. Novelty Search (NS) refers to evolutionary algorithms that replace selection of best performing individuals with selection of the most novel ones. Such methods have already shown promising results on hard exploration problems. In this work, we introduce a new NS-based method that can generate large datasets of grasping trajectories in a platform-agnostic manner. Inspired by the hierarchical learning paradigm, our method decouples approach and prehension to make the behavioral space smoother. Experiments conducted on 3 different robot-gripper setups and on several standard objects shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art for generating diverse repertoire of grasping trajectories, getting a higher successful run ratio, as well as a better diversity for both approach and prehension.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction.

The method utilizes swarming dynamics to simulate the motion of virtual agents along the stress produced in a loaded part. Agent trajectories are then used as print trajectories. With this approach, the complex global trajectory generation problem is subdivided into a set of sequential and computationally efficient quadratic programs. Through comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and experiments, we compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight a remarkable improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a 115x faster computation speed than existing methods. This efficiency, combined with the possibility to tune the trajectories spacing to match the deposition process constraints, makes the potential integration of our approach into existing 3D printing processes seamless. Additionally, the open-hole tensile specimen produced on a conventional fused filament fabrication set-up with our algorithm achieve a notable ~10% improvement in specific modulus compared to existing trajectory optimization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning using Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Overtaking Maneuvers in Autonomous Racing Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10658v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous racing are based on the sequential execution of prediction of the opposing vehicles and subsequent trajectory planning for the ego vehicle. If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed designs outperform various benchmark schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC) Spring, 2024</p></details> |

In practice, this is achieved by subgrouping, whereby clusters with similar patient characteristics are identified and then receive customized treatment plans with the goal of targeting subgroup-specific disease dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel mixture hidden Markov model for subgrouping patient trajectories from chronic diseases. Our model is probabilistic and carefully designed to capture different trajectory phases of chronic diseases (i.e., "severe", "moderate", and "mild") through tailored latent states. We demonstrate our subgrouping framework based on a longitudinal study across 847 patients with non-specific low back pain. Here, our subgrouping framework identifies 8 subgroups. Further, we show that our subgrouping framework outperforms common baselines in terms of cluster validity indices. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the model to other chronic and long-lasting diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming at Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Offline Trajectory Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories. Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts. However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation. Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6-D Trajectories for Omnidirectional Multirotor Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10392v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As fully-actuated systems, omnidirectional multirotor aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have more flexible maneuverability and advantages in aggressive flight in cluttered environments than traditional underactuated MAVs. %Due to the high dimensionality of configuration space, making the designed trajectory generation algorithm efficient is challenging. This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Generic Trajectory Planning Method for Constrained All-Wheel-Steering Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09677v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a trajectory planning method for wheeled robots with fixed steering axes while the steering angle of each wheel is constrained. In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-aware Trajectory Optimization for UAV-mounted RIS and Full-duplex Relay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12107v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as transformative tools for dynamic and adaptive connectivity. However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

However, we observed that LCM struggles to generate images with both clarity and detailed intricacy. Consequently, we introduce Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD), which encompasses trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling. The trajectory consistency function diminishes the parameterisation and distillation errors by broadening the scope of the self-consistency boundary condition with trajectory mapping and endowing the TCD with the ability to accurately trace the entire trajectory of the Probability Flow ODE in semi-linear form with an Exponential Integrator. Additionally, strategic stochastic sampling provides explicit control of stochastic and circumvents the accumulated errors inherent in multi-step consistency sampling. Experiments demonstrate that TCD not only significantly enhances image quality at low NFEs but also yields more detailed results compared to the teacher model at high NFEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mhh0318.github.io/tcd</p></details> |

| **[Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00658v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

| **[Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Sensitivity under Probabilistic Error Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07831v4)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), have emerged as pivotal instruments in machine learning and signal processing for processing graph-structured data. This paper proposes an analysis framework to investigate the sensitivity of GCNNs to probabilistic graph perturbations, directly impacting the graph shift operator (GSO). Our study establishes tight expected GSO error bounds, which are explicitly linked to the error model parameters, and reveals a linear relationship between GSO perturbations and the resulting output differences at each layer of GCNNs. This linearity demonstrates that a single-layer GCNN maintains stability under graph edge perturbations, provided that the GSO errors remain bounded, regardless of the perturbation scale. For multilayer GCNNs, the dependency of system's output difference on GSO perturbations is shown to be a recursion of linearity. Finally, we exemplify the framework with the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) and Simple Graph Convolution Network (SGCN). Experiments validate our theoretical derivations and the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Nash Equilibrium Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03518v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nash Equilibrium (NE) is the canonical solution concept of game theory, which provides an elegant tool to understand the rationalities. Though mixed strategy NE exists in any game with finite players and actions, computing NE in two- or multi-player general-sum games is PPAD-Complete. Various alternative solutions, e.g., Correlated Equilibrium (CE), and learning methods, e.g., fictitious play (FP), are proposed to approximate NE. For convenience, we call these methods as "inexact solvers", or "solvers" for short. However, the alternative solutions differ from NE and the learning methods generally fail to converge to NE. Therefore, in this work, we propose REinforcement Nash Equilibrium Solver (RENES), which trains a single policy to modify the games with different sizes and applies the solvers on the modified games where the obtained solution is evaluated on the original games. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. i) We represent the games as $\alpha$-rank response graphs and leverage graph neural network (GNN) to handle the games with different sizes as inputs; ii) We use tensor decomposition, e.g., canonical polyadic (CP), to make the dimension of modifying actions fixed for games with different sizes; iii) We train the modifying strategy for games with the widely-used proximal policy optimization (PPO) and apply the solvers to solve the modified games, where the obtained solution is evaluated on original games. Extensive experiments on large-scale normal-form games show that our method can further improve the approximation of NE of different solvers, i.e., $\alpha$-rank, CE, FP and PRD, and can be generalized to unseen games.</p></details> | IJCAI 2024 |
| **[AnchorGT: Efficient and Flexible Attention Architecture for Scalable Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03481v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have significantly advanced the field of graph representation learning by overcoming the limitations of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) and demonstrating promising performance and expressive power. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanism in GTs has limited their scalability, and previous approaches to address this issue often suffer from expressiveness degradation or lack of versatility. To address this issue, we propose AnchorGT, a novel attention architecture for GTs with global receptive field and almost linear complexity, which serves as a flexible building block to improve the scalability of a wide range of GT models. Inspired by anchor-based GNNs, we employ structurally important $k$-dominating node set as anchors and design an attention mechanism that focuses on the relationship between individual nodes and anchors, while retaining the global receptive field for all nodes. With its intuitive design, AnchorGT can easily replace the attention module in various GT models with different network architectures and structural encodings, resulting in reduced computational overhead without sacrificing performance. In addition, we theoretically prove that AnchorGT attention can be strictly more expressive than Weisfeiler-Lehman test, showing its superiority in representing graph structures. Our experiments on three state-of-the-art GT models demonstrate that their AnchorGT variants can achieve better results while being faster and significantly more memory efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Transformers without Positional Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17791v3)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Transformers for graph representation learning have become increasingly popular, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide-variety of graph datasets, either alone or in combination with message-passing graph neural networks (MP-GNNs). Infusing graph inductive-biases in the innately structure-agnostic transformer architecture in the form of structural or positional encodings (PEs) is key to achieving these impressive results. However, designing such encodings is tricky and disparate attempts have been made to engineer such encodings including Laplacian eigenvectors, relative random-walk probabilities (RRWP), spatial encodings, centrality encodings, edge encodings etc. In this work, we argue that such encodings may not be required at all, provided the attention mechanism itself incorporates information about the graph structure. We introduce Eigenformer, a Graph Transformer employing a novel spectrum-aware attention mechanism cognizant of the Laplacian spectrum of the graph, and empirically show that it achieves performance competetive with SOTA Graph Transformers on a number of standard GNN benchmarks. Additionally, we theoretically prove that Eigenformer can express various graph structural connectivity matrices, which is particularly essential when learning over smaller graphs.</p></details> | Independent Research |
| **[A method for quantifying the generalization capabilities of generative models for solving Ising models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03435v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For Ising models with complex energy landscapes, whether the ground state can be found by neural networks depends heavily on the Hamming distance between the training datasets and the ground state. Despite the fact that various recently proposed generative models have shown good performance in solving Ising models, there is no adequate discussion on how to quantify their generalization capabilities. Here we design a Hamming distance regularizer in the framework of a class of generative models, variational autoregressive networks (VAN), to quantify the generalization capabilities of various network architectures combined with VAN. The regularizer can control the size of the overlaps between the ground state and the training datasets generated by networks, which, together with the success rates of finding the ground state, form a quantitative metric to quantify their generalization capabilities. We conduct numerical experiments on several prototypical network architectures combined with VAN, including feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks, to quantify their generalization capabilities when solving Ising models. Moreover, considering the fact that the quantification of the generalization capabilities of networks on small-scale problems can be used to predict their relative performance on large-scale problems, our method is of great significance for assisting in the Neural Architecture Search field of searching for the optimal network architectures when solving large-scale Ising models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Translating Subgraphs to Nodes Makes Simple GNNs Strong and Efficient for Subgraph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04510v3)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph representation learning has emerged as an important problem, but it is by default approached with specialized graph neural networks on a large global graph. These models demand extensive memory and computational resources but challenge modeling hierarchical structures of subgraphs. In this paper, we propose Subgraph-To-Node (S2N) translation, a novel formulation for learning representations of subgraphs. Specifically, given a set of subgraphs in the global graph, we construct a new graph by coarsely transforming subgraphs into nodes. Demonstrating both theoretical and empirical evidence, S2N not only significantly reduces memory and computational costs compared to state-of-the-art models but also outperforms them by capturing both local and global structures of the subgraph. By leveraging graph coarsening methods, our method outperforms baselines even in a data-scarce setting with insufficient subgraphs. Our experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate that fined-tuned models with S2N translation can process 183 -- 711 times more subgraph samples than state-of-the-art models at a better or similar performance level.</p></details> | ICML 2024 (22 pages) |
| **[E2GNN: Efficient Graph Neural Network Ensembles for Semi-Supervised Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03401v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting. Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners. However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons. First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency. Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited. In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes. Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes. Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP. By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance. Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising of Geodetic Time Series Using Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: Application to Slow Slip Event Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03320v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet, as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals. Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coefficient Decomposition for Spectral Graph Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03296v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral graph convolutional network (SGCN) is a kind of graph neural networks (GNN) based on graph signal filters, and has shown compelling expressivity for modeling graph-structured data. Most SGCNs adopt polynomial filters and learn the coefficients from the training data. Many of them focus on which polynomial basis leads to optimal expressive power and models' architecture is little discussed. In this paper, we propose a general form in terms of spectral graph convolution, where the coefficients of polynomial basis are stored in a third-order tensor. Then, we show that the convolution block in existing SGCNs can be derived by performing a certain coefficient decomposition operation on the coefficient tensor. Based on the generalized view, we develop novel spectral graph convolutions CoDeSGC-CP and -Tucker by tensor decomposition CP and Tucker on the coefficient tensor. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed convolutions achieve favorable performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Sensing for Multiuser Beam Tracking with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03129v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs). Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem, because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.</p></details> |  |

DAGs can be used to model causal relationships among variables, but their nilpotent adjacency matrices pose unique challenges towards developing DAG signal processing and machine learning tools. To address this limitation, we harness recent advances offering alternative definitions of causal shifts and convolutions for signals on DAGs. We develop a novel convolutional graph neural network that integrates learnable DAG filters to account for the partial ordering induced by the graph topology, thus providing valuable inductive bias to learn effective representations of DAG-supported data. We discuss the salient advantages and potential limitations of the proposed DAG convolutional network (DCN) and evaluate its performance on two learning tasks using synthetic data: network diffusion estimation and source identification. DCN compares favorably relative to several baselines, showcasing its promising potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elastic Context: Encoding Elasticity for Data-driven Models of Textiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05428v3)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical interaction with textiles, such as assistive dressing, relies on advanced dextreous capabilities. The underlying complexity in textile behavior when being pulled and stretched, is due to both the yarn material properties and the textile construction technique. Today, there are no commonly adopted and annotated datasets on which the various interaction or property identification methods are assessed. One important property that affects the interaction is material elasticity that results from both the yarn material and construction technique: these two are intertwined and, if not known a-priori, almost impossible to identify through sensing commonly available on robotic platforms. We introduce Elastic Context (EC), a concept that integrates various properties that affect elastic behavior, to enable a more effective physical interaction with textiles. The definition of EC relies on stress/strain curves commonly used in textile engineering, which we reformulated for robotic applications. We employ EC using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn generalized elastic behaviors of textiles. Furthermore, we explore the effect the dimension of the EC has on accurate force modeling of non-linear real-world elastic behaviors, highlighting the challenges of current robotic setups to sense textile properties.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises 1,410 videos totaling nearly 24 hours and includes performances from 11 signers. Turkish, an agglutinative language, poses unique challenges for sign language translation, particularly with a vocabulary where 64% are singleton words and 85% are rare words, appearing less than five times. We developed two baseline models to address these challenges: the Pose to Text Transformer (P2T-T) and the Graph Neural Network based Transformer (GNN-T) models. The GNN-T model achieved 19.13% BLEU-1 score and 3.28% BLEU-4 score, presenting a significant challenge compared to existing benchmarks. The P2T-T model, while demonstrating slightly lower performance in BLEU scores, achieved a higher ROUGE-L score of 22.09%. Additionally, we benchmarked our model using the well-known PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset to validate our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, submitted to IEEE conference</p></details> |
| **[Robust Collaborative Perception without External Localization and Clock Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02965v1)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A consistent spatial-temporal coordination across multiple agents is fundamental for collaborative perception, which seeks to improve perception abilities through information exchange among agents. To achieve this spatial-temporal alignment, traditional methods depend on external devices to provide localization and clock signals. However, hardware-generated signals could be vulnerable to noise and potentially malicious attack, jeopardizing the precision of spatial-temporal alignment. Rather than relying on external hardwares, this work proposes a novel approach: aligning by recognizing the inherent geometric patterns within the perceptual data of various agents. Following this spirit, we propose a robust collaborative perception system that operates independently of external localization and clock devices. The key module of our system,~\emph{FreeAlign}, constructs a salient object graph for each agent based on its detected boxes and uses a graph neural network to identify common subgraphs between agents, leading to accurate relative pose and time. We validate \emph{FreeAlign} on both real-world and simulated datasets. The results show that, the ~\emph{FreeAlign} empowered robust collaborative perception system perform comparably to systems relying on precise localization and clock devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>6page...</summary><p>6pages, accepted to ICRA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutions via Positive Noncommutative Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19872v2)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have gained significant popularity in various heterogeneous graph learning tasks. However, most existing HGNNs rely on spatial domain-based methods to aggregate information, i.e., manually selected meta-paths or some heuristic modules, lacking theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, these methods cannot learn arbitrary valid heterogeneous graph filters within the spectral domain, which have limited expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we present a positive spectral heterogeneous graph convolution via positive noncommutative polynomials. Then, using this convolution, we propose PSHGCN, a novel Positive Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. PSHGCN offers a simple yet effective method for learning valid heterogeneous graph filters. Moreover, we demonstrate the rationale of PSHGCN in the graph optimization framework. We conducted an extensive experimental study to show that PSHGCN can learn diverse heterogeneous graph filters and outperform all baselines on open benchmarks. Notably, PSHGCN exhibits remarkable scalability, efficiently handling large real-world graphs comprising millions of nodes and edges.

| **[Graph as Point Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02795v1)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph is a fundamental data structure to model interconnections between entities. Set, on the contrary, stores independent elements. To learn graph representations, current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily use message passing to encode the interconnections. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel graph-to-set conversion method that bijectively transforms interconnected nodes into a set of independent points and then uses a set encoder to learn the graph representation. This conversion method holds dual significance. Firstly, it enables using set encoders to learn from graphs, thereby significantly expanding the design space of GNNs. Secondly, for Transformer, a specific set encoder, we provide a novel and principled approach to inject graph information losslessly, different from all the heuristic structural/positional encoding methods adopted in previous graph transformers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce Point Set Transformer (PST), a transformer architecture that accepts a point set converted from a graph as input. Theoretically, PST exhibits superior expressivity for both short-range substructure counting and long-range shortest path distance tasks compared to existing GNNs. Extensive experiments further validate PST's outstanding real-world performance. Besides Transformer, we also devise a Deepset-based set encoder, which achieves performance comparable to representative GNNs, affirming the versatility of our graph-to-set method.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Subgraph Pooling: Tackling Negative Transfer on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08907v2)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning aims to enhance performance on a target task by using knowledge from related tasks. However, when the source and target tasks are not closely aligned, it can lead to reduced performance, known as negative transfer. Unlike in image or text data, we find that negative transfer could commonly occur in graph-structured data, even when source and target graphs have semantic similarities. Specifically, we identify that structural differences significantly amplify the dissimilarities in the node embeddings across graphs. To mitigate this, we bring a new insight in this paper: for semantically similar graphs, although structural differences lead to significant distribution shift in node embeddings, their impact on subgraph embeddings could be marginal. Building on this insight, we introduce Subgraph Pooling (SP) by aggregating nodes sampled from a k-hop neighborhood and Subgraph Pooling++ (SP++) by a random walk, to mitigate the impact of graph structural differences on knowledge transfer. We theoretically analyze the role of SP in reducing graph discrepancy and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its superiority under various settings. The proposed SP methods are effective yet elegant, which can be easily applied on top of any backbone Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/Subgraph-Pooling.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI 24 |

Unlike traditional neural networks, GNNs are capable of capturing complex relationships and dependencies inherent in graph data, making them particularly suited for a wide range of applications including social network analysis, molecular chemistry, and network security. GNNs, with their unique structure and operation, present new computational challenges compared to conventional neural networks. This requires comprehensive benchmarking and a thorough characterization of GNNs to obtain insight into their computational requirements and to identify potential performance bottlenecks. In this thesis, we aim to develop a better understanding of how GNNs interact with the underlying hardware and will leverage this knowledge as we design specialized accelerators and develop new optimizations, leading to more efficient and faster GNN computations. A pivotal component within GNNs is the Sparse General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) kernel, known for its computational intensity and irregular memory access patterns. In this thesis, we address the challenges posed by SpGEMM by implementing a highly optimized hashing-based SpGEMM kernel tailored for a custom accelerator. Synthesizing these insights and optimizations, we design state-of-the-art hardware accelerators capable of efficiently handling various GNN workloads. Our accelerator architectures are built on our characterization of GNN computational demands, providing clear motivation for our approaches. This exploration into novel models underlines our comprehensive approach, as we strive to enable accelerators that are not just performant, but also versatile, able to adapt to the evolving landscape of graph computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>North...</summary><p>Northeastern University Doctoral Dissertation</p></details> |
| **[Task Aligned Meta-learning based Augmented Graph for Cold-Start Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05716v2)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold-start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems due to the lack of user-item interactions, which significantly hurts the recommendation effect over new users and items. Recently, meta-learning based methods attempt to learn globally shared prior knowledge across all users, which can be rapidly adapted to new users and items with very few interactions. Though with significant performance improvement, the globally shared parameter may lead to local optimum. Besides, they are oblivious to the inherent information and feature interactions existing in the new users and items, which are critical in cold-start scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Task aligned Meta-learning based Augmented Graph (TMAG) to address cold-start recommendation. Specifically, a fine-grained task aligned constructor is proposed to cluster similar users and divide tasks for meta-learning, enabling consistent optimization direction. Besides, an augmented graph neural network with two graph enhanced approaches is designed to alleviate data sparsity and capture the high-order user-item interactions. We validate our approach on three real-world datasets in various cold-start scenarios, showing the superiority of TMAG over state-of-the-art methods for cold-start recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locality-Aware Graph-Rewiring in GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01668v2)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular models for machine learning on graphs that typically follow the message-passing paradigm, whereby the feature of a node is updated recursively upon aggregating information over its neighbors. While exchanging messages over the input graph endows GNNs with a strong inductive bias, it can also make GNNs susceptible to over-squashing, thereby preventing them from capturing long-range interactions in the given graph. To rectify this issue, graph rewiring techniques have been proposed as a means of improving information flow by altering the graph connectivity. In this work, we identify three desiderata for graph-rewiring: (i) reduce over-squashing, (ii) respect the locality of the graph, and (iii) preserve the sparsity of the graph. We highlight fundamental trade-offs that occur between spatial and spectral rewiring techniques; while the former often satisfy (i) and (ii) but not (iii), the latter generally satisfy (i) and (iii) at the expense of (ii). We propose a novel rewiring framework that satisfies all of (i)--(iii) through a locality-aware sequence of rewiring operations. We then discuss a specific instance of such rewiring framework and validate its effectiveness on several real-world benchmarks, showing that it either matches or significantly outperforms existing rewiring approaches.</p></details> |  |

While the data-driven models investigate affordances of single or paired objects, there is a gap in the exploration of affordances of compound objects composed of an arbitrary number of objects. We propose the Multi-Object Graph Affordance Network which models complex compound object affordances by learning the outcomes of robot actions that facilitate interactions between an object and a compound. Given the depth images of the objects, the object features are extracted via convolution operations and encoded in the nodes of graph neural networks. Graph convolution operations are used to encode the state of the compounds, which are used as input to decoders to predict the outcome of the object-compound interactions. After learning the compound object affordances, given different tasks, the learned outcome predictors are used to plan sequences of stack actions that involve stacking objects on top of each other, inserting smaller objects into larger containers and passing through ring-like objects through poles. We showed that our system successfully modeled the affordances of compound objects that include concave and convex objects, in both simulated and real-world environments. We benchmarked our system with a baseline model to highlight its advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Despite recent advances, existing methods still face challenges such as limited ability to generalize, and inadequate representation of learning from unlabeled data, especially for tasks specific to molecular structures. To address these limitations, we introduce DIG-Mol, a novel self-supervised graph neural network framework for molecular property prediction. This architecture leverages the power of contrast learning with dual interaction mechanisms and unique molecular graph enhancement strategies. DIG-Mol integrates a momentum distillation network with two interconnected networks to efficiently improve molecular characterization. The framework's ability to extract key information about molecular structure and higher-order semantics is supported by minimizing loss of contrast. We have established DIG-Mol's state-of-the-art performance through extensive experimental evaluation in a variety of molecular property prediction tasks. In addition to demonstrating superior transferability in a small number of learning scenarios, our visualizations highlight DIG-Mol's enhanced interpretability and representation capabilities. These findings confirm the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming challenges faced by traditional methods and mark a significant advance in molecular property prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Genetic Algorithms with Neural Cost Predictor for Solving Hierarchical Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14157v2)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When vehicle routing decisions are intertwined with higher-level decisions, the resulting optimization problems pose significant challenges for computation. Examples are the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), where customers are assigned to depots before delivery, and the capacitated location routing problem (CLRP), where the locations of depots should be determined first. A simple and straightforward approach for such hierarchical problems would be to separate the higher-level decisions from the complicated vehicle routing decisions. For each higher-level decision candidate, we may evaluate the underlying vehicle routing problems to assess the candidate. As this approach requires solving vehicle routing problems multiple times, it has been regarded as impractical in most cases. We propose a novel deep-learning-based approach called Genetic Algorithm with Neural Cost Predictor (GANCP) to tackle the challenge and simplify algorithm developments. For each higher-level decision candidate, we predict the objective function values of the underlying vehicle routing problems using a pre-trained graph neural network without actually solving the routing problems. In particular, our proposed neural network learns the objective values of the HGS-CVRP open-source package that solves capacitated vehicle routing problems. Our numerical experiments show that this simplified approach is effective and efficient in generating high-quality solutions for both MDVRP and CLRP and has the potential to expedite algorithm developments for complicated hierarchical problems. We provide computational results evaluated in the standard benchmark instances used in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Recent theoretical studies on the expressive power of GNNs have focused on two issues. On the one hand, it has been proven that GNNs are as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test (1-WL) in their ability to distinguish graphs. Moreover, it has been shown that the equivalence enforced by 1-WL equals unfolding equivalence. On the other hand, GNNs turned out to be universal approximators on graphs modulo the constraints enforced by 1-WL/unfolding equivalence. However, these results only apply to Static Attributed Undirected Homogeneous Graphs (SAUHG) with node attributes. In contrast, real-life applications often involve a much larger variety of graph types. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the expressive power of GNNs for two other graph domains that are particularly interesting in practical applications, namely dynamic graphs and SAUGHs with edge attributes. Dynamic graphs are widely used in modern applications; hence, the study of the expressive capability of GNNs in this domain is essential for practical reasons and, in addition, it requires a new analyzing approach due to the difference in the architecture of dynamic GNNs compared to static ones. On the other hand, the examination of SAUHGs is of particular relevance since they act as a standard form for all graph types: it has been shown that all graph types can be transformed without loss of information to SAUHGs with both attributes on nodes and edges. This paper considers generic GNN models and appropriate 1-WL tests for those domains. Then, the known results on the expressive power of GNNs are extended to the mentioned domains: it is proven that GNNs have the same capability as the 1-WL test, the 1-WL equivalence equals unfolding equivalence and that GNNs are universal approximators modulo 1-WL/unfolding equivalence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Forecasts Caldera Collapse Events at Kilauea Volcano](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19351v2)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the three month long eruption of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii in 2018, the pre-existing summit caldera collapsed in over 60 quasi-periodic failure events. The last 40 of these events, which generated Mw >5 very long period (VLP) earthquakes, had inter-event times between 0.8 - 2.2 days. These failure events offer a unique dataset for testing methods for predicting earthquake recurrence based on locally recorded GPS, tilt, and seismicity data. In this work, we train a deep learning graph neural network (GNN) to predict the time-to-failure of the caldera collapse events using only a fraction of the data recorded at the start of each cycle. We find that the GNN generalizes to unseen data and can predict the time-to-failure to within a few hours using only 0.5 days of data, substantially improving upon a null model based only on inter-event statistics. Predictions improve with increasing input data length, and are most accurate when using high-SNR tilt-meter data. Applying the trained GNN to synthetic data with different magma pressure decay times predicts failure at a nearly constant stress threshold, revealing that the GNN is sensing the underling physics of caldera collapse. These findings demonstrate the predictability of caldera collapse sequences under well monitored conditions, and highlight the potential of machine learning methods for forecasting real world catastrophic events with limited training data.</p></details> |  |

Developing methods that predict binding affinity changes under substitution mutations is fundamental for modelling and re-engineering biological systems. Deep learning is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool capable of bridging the gap between in-silico predictions and in-vitro observations. With this contribution, we propose eGRAL, a novel SE(3) equivariant graph neural network (eGNN) architecture designed for predicting binding affinity changes from multiple amino acid substitutions in protein complexes. eGRAL leverages residue, atomic and evolutionary scales, thanks to features extracted from protein large language models. To address the limited availability of large-scale affinity assays with structural information, we generate a simulated dataset comprising approximately 500,000 data points. Our model is pre-trained on this dataset, then fine-tuned and tested on experimental data.</p></details> |  |

We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

This proposed neural transport solver learns the conservative SL FD discretization directly from data, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes, while significantly simplifying algorithm implementation. We validate the method' s effectiveness and efficiency through numerical tests on benchmark transport equations in both one and two dimensions, as well as the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2309.04943</p></details> |

There are urgent needs on powerful heterogeneous graph neural networks to effectively support important applications. We identify a potential semantic mixing issue in existing message passing processes, where the representations of the neighbors of a node $v$ are forced to be transformed to the feature space of $v$ for aggregation, though the neighbors are in different types. That is, the semantics in different node types are entangled together into node $v$'s representation. To address the issue, we propose SlotGAT with separate message passing processes in slots, one for each node type, to maintain the representations in their own node-type feature spaces. Moreover, in a slot-based message passing layer, we design an attention mechanism for effective slot-wise message aggregation. Further, we develop a slot attention technique after the last layer of SlotGAT, to learn the importance of different slots in downstream tasks. Our analysis indicates that the slots in SlotGAT can preserve different semantics in various feature spaces. The superiority of SlotGAT is evaluated against 13 baselines on 6 datasets for node classification and link prediction.

| **[CVTGAD: Simplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for Unsupervised Graph-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02359v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has received remarkable performance in various critical disciplines, such as chemistry analysis and bioinformatics. Existing UGAD paradigms often adopt data augmentation techniques to construct multiple views, and then employ different strategies to obtain representations from different views for jointly conducting UGAD. However, most previous works only considered the relationship between nodes/graphs from a limited receptive field, resulting in some key structure patterns and feature information being neglected. In addition, most existing methods consider different views separately in a parallel manner, which is not able to explore the inter-relationship across different views directly. Thus, a method with a larger receptive field that can explore the inter-relationship across different views directly is in need. In this paper, we propose a novel Simplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for Unsupervised Graph-level Anomaly Detection, namely, CVTGAD. To increase the receptive field, we construct a simplified transformer-based module, exploiting the relationship between nodes/graphs from both intra-graph and inter-graph perspectives. Furthermore, we design a cross-view attention mechanism to directly exploit the view co-occurrence between different views, bridging the inter-view gap at node level and graph level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply transformer and cross attention to UGAD, which realizes graph neural network and transformer working collaboratively. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets of 3 fields demonstrate the superiority of CVTGAD on the UGAD task.

| **[Revisiting Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation from the Perspective of Graph Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17862v2)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently capturing consistent and complementary semantic features in a multimodal conversation context is crucial for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC). Existing methods mainly use graph structures to model dialogue context semantic dependencies and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture multimodal semantic features for emotion recognition. However, these methods are limited by some inherent characteristics of GNN, such as over-smoothing and low-pass filtering, resulting in the inability to learn long-distance consistency information and complementary information efficiently. Since consistency and complementarity information correspond to low-frequency and high-frequency information, respectively, this paper revisits the problem of multimodal emotion recognition in conversation from the perspective of the graph spectrum. Specifically, we propose a Graph-Spectrum-based Multimodal Consistency and Complementary collaborative learning framework GS-MCC. First, GS-MCC uses a sliding window to construct a multimodal interaction graph to model conversational relationships and uses efficient Fourier graph operators to extract long-distance high-frequency and low-frequency information, respectively. Then, GS-MCC uses contrastive learning to construct self-supervised signals that reflect complementarity and consistent semantic collaboration with high and low-frequency signals, thereby improving the ability of high and low-frequency information to reflect real emotions. Finally, GS-MCC inputs the collaborative high and low-frequency information into the MLP network and softmax function for emotion prediction. Extensive experiments have proven the superiority of the GS-MCC architecture proposed in this paper on two benchmark data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Subgraph-level explanations are gaining attention for their intuitive appeal. However, most existing subgraph-level explainers face efficiency challenges in explaining GNNs due to complex search processes. The key challenge is to find a balance between intuitiveness and efficiency while ensuring transparency. Additionally, these explainers usually induce subgraphs by nodes, which may introduce less-intuitive disconnected nodes in the subgraph-level explanations or omit many important subgraph structures. In this paper, we reveal that inducing subgraph explanations by edges is more comprehensive than other subgraph inducing techniques. We also emphasize the need of determining the subgraph explanation size for each data instance, as different data instances may involve different important substructures. Building upon these considerations, we introduce a training-free approach, named EiG-Search. We employ an efficient linear-time search algorithm over the edge-induced subgraphs, where the edges are ranked by an enhanced gradient-based importance. We conduct extensive experiments on a total of seven datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and efficiency both quantitatively and qualitatively over the leading baselines.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[ATNPA: A Unified View of Oversmoothing Alleviation in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01663v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing is a commonly observed challenge in graph neural network (GNN) learning, where, as layers increase, embedding features learned from GNNs quickly become similar/indistinguishable, making them incapable of differentiating network proximity. A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial to harness deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare their difference in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first outline three themes to tackle oversmoothing, and then separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to the ATNPA, and discussion about their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field, but also shows a clear road map for future study.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[What Planning Problems Can A Relational Neural Network Solve?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03682v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal-conditioned policies are generally understood to be "feed-forward" circuits, in the form of neural networks that map from the current state and the goal specification to the next action to take. However, under what circumstances such a policy can be learned and how efficient the policy will be are not well understood. In this paper, we present a circuit complexity analysis for relational neural networks (such as graph neural networks and transformers) representing policies for planning problems, by drawing connections with serialized goal regression search (S-GRS). We show that there are three general classes of planning problems, in terms of the growth of circuit width and depth as a function of the number of objects and planning horizon, providing constructive proofs. We also illustrate the utility of this analysis for designing neural networks for policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 (Spotlight).

GTX has a unique latch-free graph storage and a transaction and concurrency control protocol for dynamic power-law graphs. GTX leverages atomic operations to eliminate latches, proposes a delta-based multi-version storage, and designs a hybrid transaction commit protocol to reduce interference between concurrent operations. To further improve its throughput, we design a delta-chains index to support efficient edge lookups. GTX manages concurrency control at delta-chain level, and provides adaptive concurrency according to the workload. Real-world graph access and updates exhibit temporal localities and hotspots. Unlike other transactional graph systems that experience significant performance degradation, GTX is the only system that can adapt to temporal localities and hotspots in graph updates and maintain million-transactions-per-second throughput. GTX is prototyped as a graph library and is evaluated using a graph library evaluation tool using real and synthetic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages 2 figures for VLDB 2024 DEMO</p></details> |

Here, we investigate the effect of modelling choices on the feature learning characteristics of graph neural networks applied to a brain shape classification task. Specifically, we analyse the effect of using parameter-efficient, shared graph convolutional submodels compared to structure-specific, non-shared submodels. Further, we assess the effect of mesh registration as part of the data harmonisation pipeline. We find substantial differences in the feature embeddings at different layers of the models. Our results highlight that test accuracy alone is insufficient to identify important model characteristics such as encoded biases related to data source or potentially non-discriminative features learned in submodels. Our model inspection framework offers a valuable tool for practitioners to better understand performance characteristics of deep learning models in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |

The proposed encoding is sufficient to distinguish Strongly Regular Graphs, a family of challenging 3-WL equivalent graphs. We show theoretically that such encoding is more expressive than node-based sub-graph MP-GNNs.

However, the prevailing challenges in most graph datasets are twofold of Insufficient High-Quality Labels and Lack of Neighborhoods, resulting in weak GNNs. Existing data augmentation methods designed to address these two issues often tackle only one. They may either require extensive training of generators, rely on overly simplistic strategies, or demand substantial prior knowledge, leading to suboptimal generalization abilities. To simultaneously address both of these two challenges, we propose an elegant method called IntraMix. IntraMix innovatively employs Mixup among low-quality labeled data of the same class, generating high-quality labeled data at minimal cost. Additionally, it establishes neighborhoods for the generated data by connecting them with data from the same class with high confidence, thereby enriching the neighborhoods of graphs. IntraMix efficiently tackles both challenges faced by graphs and challenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node classification. IntraMix serves as a universal framework that can be readily applied to all GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IntraMix across various GNNs and datasets.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[On the Scalability of GNNs for Molecular Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11568v3)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning models has been at the heart of recent revolutions in language modelling and image generation. Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

The main limitation of existing CEM methods is that they are computationally demanding. Our work introduces a leap forward in scientific computing and CEM by proposing an original solution of Maxwell's equations that is grounded on graph neural networks (GNNs) and enables the high-performance numerical resolution of these fundamental mathematical expressions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the update equations derived by discretizing Maxwell's partial differential equations can be innately expressed as a two-layer GNN with static and pre-determined edge weights. Given this intuition, a straightforward way to numerically solve Maxwell's equations entails simple message passing between such a GNN's nodes, yielding a significant computational time gain, while preserving the same accuracy as conventional transient CEM methods. Ultimately, our work supports the efficient and precise emulation of electromagnetic wave propagation with GNNs, and more importantly, we anticipate that applying a similar treatment to systems of partial differential equations arising in other scientific disciplines, e.g., computational fluid dynamics, can benefit computational sciences</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques have been applied on fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with a particular emphasis on the robustness of biomarkers produced for neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies vary greatly across studies on the same disorder and little has been done to evaluate their robustness. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on improving the robustness of potential biomarkers discovered via GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Additionally exploiting social relations is clearly effective in understanding users' tastes due to the effects of homophily and social influence. For this reason, SocialRS has increasingly attracted attention. In particular, with the advance of graph neural networks (GNN), many GNN-based SocialRS methods have been developed recently. Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature on GNN-based SocialRS. In this survey, we first identify 84 papers on GNN-based SocialRS after annotating 2151 papers by following the PRISMA framework (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). Then, we comprehensively review them in terms of their inputs and architectures to propose a novel taxonomy: (1) input taxonomy includes 5 groups of input type notations and 7 groups of input representation notations; (2) architecture taxonomy includes 8 groups of GNN encoder notations, 2 groups of decoder notations, and 12 groups of loss function notations. We classify the GNN-based SocialRS methods into several categories as per the taxonomy and describe their details. Furthermore, we summarize benchmark datasets and metrics widely used to evaluate the GNN-based SocialRS methods. Finally, we conclude this survey by presenting some future research directions.

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Enabled by recent developments in scalable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this approach encodes relational information at a subgroup level (multiple connected nodes) rather than at a node level of abstraction. We posit that certain domain applications, such as anti-money laundering (AML), are inherently subgraph problems and mainstream graph techniques have been operating at a suboptimal level of abstraction. This is due in part to the scarcity of annotated datasets of real-world size and complexity, as well as the lack of software tools for managing subgraph GNN workflows at scale. To enable work in fundamental algorithms as well as domain applications in AML and beyond, we introduce Elliptic2, a large graph dataset containing 122K labeled subgraphs of Bitcoin clusters within a background graph consisting of 49M node clusters and 196M edge transactions. The dataset provides subgraphs known to be linked to illicit activity for learning the set of "shapes" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity. Along with the dataset we share our graph techniques, software tooling, promising early experimental results, and new domain insights already gleaned from this approach. Taken together, we find immediate practical value in this approach and the potential for a new standard in anti-money laundering and forensic analytics in cryptocurrencies and other financial networks.</p></details> |  |

A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

We also employ the logics, and the techniques used to analyze them, to obtain decision procedures for verification problems over GNNs. We complement this with undecidability results for static analysis problems involving the logics, as well as for GNN verification problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Graph Neural Network-based Fault Localization Through Enhanced Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04496v5)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software fault localization plays an important role in software quality assurance by pinpointing faulty locations for easier debugging. Coverage-based fault localization, a widely used technique, employs statistics on coverage spectra to rank code based on suspiciousness scores. However, the rigidity of statistical approaches calls for learning-based techniques. Amongst all, Grace, a graph-neural network (GNN) based technique has achieved state-of-the-art due to its capacity to preserve coverage spectra, i.e., test-to-source coverage relationships, as precise abstract syntax-enhanced graph representation, mitigating the limitation of other learning-based technique which compresses the feature representation. However, such representation struggles with scalability due to the increasing complexity of software and associated coverage spectra and AST graphs. In this work, we proposed a new graph representation, DepGraph, that reduces the complexity of the graph representation by 70% in nodes and edges by integrating interprocedural call graph in the graph representation of the code. Moreover, we integrate additional features such as code change information in the graph as attributes so the model can leverage rich historical project data. We evaluate DepGraph using Defects4j 2.0.0, and it outperforms Grace by locating 20% more faults in Top-1 and improving the Mean First Rank (MFR) and the Mean Average Rank (MAR) by over 50% while decreasing GPU memory usage by 44% and training/inference time by 85%. Additionally, in cross-project settings, DepGraph surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline with a 42% higher Top-1 accuracy, and 68% and 65% improvement in MFR and MAR, respectively. Our study demonstrates DepGraph's robustness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability for future extension and adoption.</p></details> |  |

Given a graph neural network M, a robust counterfactual witness refers to the fraction of a graph G that are counterfactual and factual explanation of the results of M over G, but also remains so for any "disturbed" G by flipping up to k of its node pairs. We establish the hardness results, from tractable results to co-NP-hardness, for verifying and generating robust counterfactual witnesses. We study such structures for GNN-based node classification, and present efficient algorithms to verify and generate RCWs. We also provide a parallel algorithm to verify and generate RCWs for large graphs with scalability guarantees.

As opposed to conventional frame-based vision sensors, event-based cameras deliver a microsecond-scale temporal resolution with sparse information encoding, thereby outlining new opportunities for edge vision systems. However, mainstream algorithms for frame-based vision, which mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can hardly exploit the advantages of event-based vision as they are typically optimized for dense matrix-vector multiplications. While event-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sparse event-based vision, their irregular structure is a challenge that currently hinders the design of efficient hardware accelerators. In this paper, we propose EvGNN, the first event-driven GNN accelerator for low-footprint, ultra-low-latency, and high-accuracy edge vision with event-based cameras. It relies on three central ideas: (i) directed dynamic graphs exploiting single-hop nodes with edge-free storage, (ii) event queues for the efficient identification of local neighbors within a spatiotemporally decoupled search range, and (iii) a novel layer-parallel processing scheme enabling the low-latency execution of multi-layer GNNs. We deployed EvGNN on a Xilinx KV260 Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform and benchmarked it on the N-CARS dataset for car recognition, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 87.8% and an average latency per event of 16$\mu$s, thereby enabling real-time, microsecond-resolution event-based vision at the edge.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

Existing deep learning approaches mainly adopt multiple instance learning or graph neural networks under weak supervision. Most of them are unable to uncover the diverse interactions between different types of biological entities(\textit{e.g.}, cell cluster and tissue block) across multiple scales, while such interactions are crucial for patient survival prediction. In light of this, we propose a novel multi-scale heterogeneity-aware hypergraph representation framework. Specifically, our framework first constructs a multi-scale heterogeneity-aware hypergraph and assigns each node with its biological entity type. It then mines diverse interactions between nodes on the graph structure to obtain a global representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets.

| **[Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00742v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating cybersecurity risk in electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the safe operation of collective EV chargings, the stability of the power grid, and the cost-effective infrastructure expansion. However, existing methods either suffer from the data privacy issue and the susceptibility to cyberattacks or fail to consider the spatial correlation among different stations. To address these challenges, a federated graph learning approach involving multiple charging stations is proposed to collaboratively train a more generalized deep learning model for demand forecasting while capturing spatial correlations among various stations and enhancing robustness against potential attacks. Firstly, for better model performance, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is leveraged to characterize the geographic correlation among different charging stations in a federated manner. Secondly, to ensure robustness and deal with the data heterogeneity in a federated setting, a message passing that utilizes a global attention mechanism to aggregate personalized models for each client is proposed. Thirdly, by concerning cyberattacks, a special credit-based function is designed to mitigate potential threats from malicious clients or unwanted attacks. Extensive experiments on a public EV charging dataset are conducted using various deep learning techniques and federated learning methods to demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages,4 figures |

However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPGNN: Recognizing Salient Subgraph Patterns via Enhanced Graph Convolution and Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13655v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of machine learning on non-Euclidean data such as graphs and networks. GNNs effectively implement node representation learning through neighborhood aggregation and achieve impressive results in many graph-related tasks. However, most neighborhood aggregation approaches are summation-based, which can be problematic as they may not be sufficiently expressive to encode informative graph structures. Furthermore, though the graph pooling module is also of vital importance for graph learning, especially for the task of graph classification, research on graph down-sampling mechanisms is rather limited. To address the above challenges, we propose a concatenation-based graph convolution mechanism that injectively updates node representations to maximize the discriminative power in distinguishing non-isomorphic subgraphs. In addition, we design a novel graph pooling module, called WL-SortPool, to learn important subgraph patterns in a deep-learning manner. WL-SortPool layer-wise sorts node representations (i.e. continuous WL colors) to separately learn the relative importance of subtrees with different depths for the purpose of classification, thus better characterizing the complex graph topology and rich information encoded in the graph. We propose a novel Subgraph Pattern GNN (SPGNN) architecture that incorporates these enhancements. We test the proposed SPGNN architecture on many graph classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method can achieve highly competitive results with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other GNN approaches.</p></details> |  |

They disseminate information through interconnected nodes, but long-range interactions face challenges known as "over-squashing". This survey delves into the challenge of over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where long-range information dissemination is hindered, impacting tasks reliant on intricate long-distance interactions. It comprehensively explores the causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies for over-squashing. Various methodologies are reviewed, including graph rewiring, novel normalization, spectral analysis, and curvature-based strategies, with a focus on their trade-offs and effectiveness. The survey also discusses the interplay between over-squashing and other GNN limitations, such as over-smoothing, and provides a taxonomy of models designed to address these issues in node and graph-level tasks. Benchmark datasets for performance evaluation are also detailed, making this survey a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the GNN field.</p></details> | 14 pages |

A typical approach is to rely on Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures, which encode inputs in high-dimensional latent spaces that are repeatedly transformed during the execution of the algorithm. In this work we perform a detailed analysis of the structure of the latent space induced by the GNN when executing algorithms. We identify two possible failure modes: (i) loss of resolution, making it hard to distinguish similar values; (ii) inability to deal with values outside the range observed during training. We propose to solve the first issue by relying on a softmax aggregator, and propose to decay the latent space in order to deal with out-of-range values. We show that these changes lead to improvements on the majority of algorithms in the standard CLRS-30 benchmark when using the state-of-the-art Triplet-GMPNN processor.

Although the ability to handle less-homophilic graphs is restricted, classical GNNs still stand out in several nice properties such as efficiency, simplicity, and explainability. In this work, we propose a novel graph restructuring method that can be integrated into any type of GNNs, including classical GNNs, to leverage the benefits of existing GNNs while alleviating their limitations. Our contribution is threefold: a) learning the weight of pseudo-eigenvectors for an adaptive spectral clustering that aligns well with known node labels, b) proposing a new density-aware homophilic metric that is robust to label imbalance, and c) reconstructing the adjacency matrix based on the result of adaptive spectral clustering to maximize the homophilic scores. The experimental results show that our graph restructuring method can significantly boost the performance of six classical GNNs by an average of 25% on less-homophilic graphs. The boosted performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, AAAI 2023</p></details> |
| **[Multi-stage Attack Detection and Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks: An IoT Feasibility Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18328v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ever-increasing reliance on digital networks for various aspects of modern life, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Intrusion Detection Systems play a crucial role in ensuring network security, actively identifying and mitigating malicious behaviours. However, the relentless advancement of cyber-threats has rendered traditional/classical approaches insufficient in addressing the sophistication and complexity of attacks. This paper proposes a novel 3-stage intrusion detection system inspired by a simplified version of the Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain to detect advanced multi-step attacks. The proposed approach consists of three models, each responsible for detecting a group of attacks with common characteristics. The detection outcome of the first two stages is used to conduct a feasibility study on the possibility of predicting attacks in the third stage. Using the ToN IoT dataset, we achieved an average of 94% F1-Score among different stages, outperforming the benchmark approaches based on Random-forest model. Finally, we comment on the feasibility of this approach to be integrated in a real-world system and propose various possible future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Tuning Large Language Models for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18271v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-rich graphs, which exhibit rich textual information on nodes and edges, are prevalent across a wide range of real-world business applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Mesh Optimization of a Hybrid Deep Learning Black-Box PDE Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11766v2)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in computational fluid dynamics. Recent research proposed a PDE correction framework that leverages deep learning to correct the solution obtained by a PDE solver on a coarse mesh. However, end-to-end training of such a PDE correction model over both solver-dependent parameters such as mesh parameters and neural network parameters requires the PDE solver to support automatic differentiation through the iterative numerical process. Such a feature is not readily available in many existing solvers. In this study, we explore the feasibility of end-to-end training of a hybrid model with a black-box PDE solver and a deep learning model for fluid flow prediction. Specifically, we investigate a hybrid model that integrates a black-box PDE solver into a differentiable deep graph neural network. To train this model, we use a zeroth-order gradient estimator to differentiate the PDE solver via forward propagation. Although experiments show that the proposed approach based on zeroth-order gradient estimation underperforms the baseline that computes exact derivatives using automatic differentiation, our proposed method outperforms the baseline trained with a frozen input mesh to the solver. Moreover, with a simple warm-start on the neural network parameters, we show that models trained by these zeroth-order algorithms achieve an accelerated convergence and improved generalization performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most research focuses on static graphs, neglecting the dynamic nature of real-world networks where topologies and attributes evolve over time. By integrating sequence modeling modules into traditional GNN architectures, dynamic GNNs aim to bridge this gap, capturing the inherent temporal dependencies of dynamic graphs for a more authentic depiction of complex networks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts, key techniques, and state-of-the-art dynamic GNN models. We present the mainstream dynamic GNN models in detail and categorize models based on how temporal information is incorporated. We also discuss large-scale dynamic GNNs and pre-training techniques. Although dynamic GNNs have shown superior performance, challenges remain in scalability, handling heterogeneous information, and lack of diverse graph datasets. The paper also discusses possible future directions, such as adaptive and memory-enhanced models, inductive learning, and theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Gradient Descent for Gaussian Processes Done Right](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20581v2)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As is well known, both sampling from the posterior and computing the mean of the posterior in Gaussian process regression reduces to solving a large linear system of equations. We study the use of stochastic gradient descent for solving this linear system, and show that when \emph{done right} -- by which we mean using specific insights from the optimisation and kernel communities -- stochastic gradient descent is highly effective. To that end, we introduce a particularly simple \emph{stochastic dual descent} algorithm, explain its design in an intuitive manner and illustrate the design choices through a series of ablation studies. Further experiments demonstrate that our new method is highly competitive. In particular, our evaluations on the UCI regression tasks and on Bayesian optimisation set our approach apart from preconditioned conjugate gradients and variational Gaussian process approximations. Moreover, our method places Gaussian process regression on par with state-of-the-art graph neural networks for molecular binding affinity prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaDRec: Contextualized and Debiased Recommender Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06895v2)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender models aimed at mining users' behavioral patterns have raised great attention as one of the essential applications in daily life. Recent work on graph neural networks (GNNs) or debiasing methods has attained remarkable gains. However, they still suffer from (1) over-smoothing node embeddings caused by recursive convolutions with GNNs, and (2) the skewed distribution of interactions due to popularity and user-individual biases. This paper proposes a contextualized and debiased recommender model (CaDRec). To overcome the over-smoothing issue, we explore a novel hypergraph convolution operator that can select effective neighbors during convolution by introducing both structural context and sequential context. To tackle the skewed distribution, we propose two strategies for disentangling interactions: (1) modeling individual biases to learn unbiased item embeddings, and (2) incorporating item popularity with positional encoding. Moreover, we mathematically show that the imbalance of the gradients to update item embeddings exacerbates the popularity bias, thus adopting regularization and weighting schemes as solutions. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the CaDRec against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/CaDRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating. In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback. To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations. Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process. The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines.

However, deploying these approaches for large-scale networks poses significant challenges. In this paper, we leverage the power of heterogeneous graph neural networks to propose a novel data-driven approach for end-to-end traffic assignment and traffic flow learning. Our model integrates an adaptive graph attention mechanism with auxiliary "virtual" links connecting origin-destination node pairs, This integration enables the model to capture spatial traffic patterns across different links, By incorporating the node-based flow conservation law into the overall loss function, the model ensures the prediction results in compliance with flow conservation principles, resulting in highly accurate predictions for both link flow and flow-capacity ratios. We present numerical experiments on urban transportation networks and show that the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model outperforms other conventional neural network models in terms of convergence rate and prediction accuracy. Notably, by introducing two different training strategies, the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model can also be generalized to different network topologies. This approach offers a promising solution for complex traffic flow analysis and prediction, enhancing our understanding and management of a wide range of transportation systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

By gaining a better understanding of what makes a good outfit, companies can provide useful product recommendations to their users. In this project, we follow two existing approaches that employ graphs to represent outfits and use modified versions of the Graph neural network (GNN) frameworks. Both Node-wise Graph Neural Network (NGNN) and Hypergraph Neural Network aim to score a set of items according to the outfit compatibility of items. The data used is the Polyvore Dataset which consists of curated outfits with product images and text descriptions for each product in an outfit. We recreate the analysis on a subset of this data and compare the two existing models on their performance on two tasks Fill in the blank (FITB): finding an item that completes an outfit, and Compatibility prediction: estimating compatibility of different items grouped as an outfit. We can replicate the results directionally and find that HGNN does have a slightly better performance on both tasks. On top of replicating the results of the two papers we also tried to use embeddings generated from a vision transformer and witness enhanced prediction accuracy across the board</p></details> |  |

Recently, studies revealed their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we theoretically define the concept of expected robustness in the context of attributed graphs and relate it to the classical definition of adversarial robustness in the graph representation learning literature. Our definition allows us to derive an upper bound of the expected robustness of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks subject to node feature attacks. Building on these findings, we connect the expected robustness of GNNs to the orthonormality of their weight matrices and consequently propose an attack-independent, more robust variant of the GCN, called the Graph Convolutional Orthonormal Robust Networks (GCORNs). We further introduce a probabilistic method to estimate the expected robustness, which allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of GCORN on several real-world datasets. Experimental experiments showed that GCORN outperforms available defense methods.

While effective, these methods are limited to the system domain, where the type of system remains consistent and thus cannot ensure the adaptation to new, or unseen physical systems governed by different laws. For instance, a neural network trained on a mass-spring system cannot guarantee accurate predictions for the behavior of a two-body system or any other system with different physical laws. In this work, we take a significant leap forward by targeting cross domain generalization within the field of Hamiltonian dynamics. We model our system with a graph neural network (GNN) and employ a meta learning algorithm to enable the model to gain experience over a distribution of systems and make it adapt to new physics. Our approach aims to learn a unified Hamiltonian representation that is generalizable across multiple system domains, thereby overcoming the limitations of system-specific models. We demonstrate that the meta-trained model captures the generalized Hamiltonian representation that is consistent across different physical domains. Overall, through the use of meta learning, we offer a framework that achieves cross domain generalization, providing a step towards a unified model for understanding a wide array of dynamical systems via deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new multi-teacher distillation method based on bi-level optimization (namely BO-NNC), to conduct noisy node classification on the graph data. Specifically, we first employ multiple self-supervised learning methods to train diverse teacher models, and then aggregate their predictions through a teacher weight matrix. Furthermore, we design a new bi-level optimization strategy to dynamically adjust the teacher weight matrix based on the training progress of the student model. Finally, we design a label improvement module to improve the label quality. Extensive experimental results on real datasets show that our method achieves the best results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, their adoption has not been pervasive because of scalability challenges associated with large-scale graph datasets, particularly when leveraging message passing. To tackle these challenges, we introduce NeuraChip, a novel GNN spatial accelerator based on Gustavson's algorithm. NeuraChip decouples the multiplication and addition computations in sparse matrix multiplication. This separation allows for independent exploitation of their unique data dependencies, facilitating efficient resource allocation. We introduce a rolling eviction strategy to mitigate data idling in on-chip memory as well as address the prevalent issue of memory bloat in sparse graph computations. Furthermore, the compute resource load balancing is achieved through a dynamic reseeding hash-based mapping, ensuring uniform utilization of computing resources agnostic of sparsity patterns. Finally, we present NeuraSim, an open-source, cycle-accurate, multi-threaded, modular simulator for comprehensive performance analysis. Overall, NeuraChip presents a significant improvement, yielding an average speedup of 22.1x over Intel's MKL, 17.1x over NVIDIA's cuSPARSE, 16.7x over AMD's hipSPARSE, and 1.5x over prior state-of-the-art SpGEMM accelerator and 1.3x over GNN accelerator.

However, despite their impressive performance, the fairness problem has increasingly gained attention as a crucial aspect to consider. Existing research in graph learning focuses on either group fairness or individual fairness. However, since each concept provides unique insights into fairness from distinct perspectives, integrating them into a fair graph neural network system is crucial. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet to comprehensively tackle both individual and group fairness simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new concept of individual fairness within groups and a novel framework named Fairness for Group and Individual (FairGI), which considers both group fairness and individual fairness within groups in the context of graph learning. FairGI employs the similarity matrix of individuals to achieve individual fairness within groups, while leveraging adversarial learning to address group fairness in terms of both Equal Opportunity and Statistical Parity. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of group fairness and individual fairness within groups, but also exhibits excellent performance in population-level individual fairness, while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

To deal with these challenges, we propose a novel approach for modeling network routing, using Graph Neural Networks. Our method can also be used for network-latency estimation. Supported by a domain-knowledge-assisted graph formulation, our model shares a stable performance across different network sizes and configurations of routing networks, while at the same time being able to extrapolate towards unseen sizes, configurations, and user behavior.

Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible. Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based optimization.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in this regard, by leveraging the spatial relationships between EEG electrodes through adjacency matrices. The EEG_GLT-Net framework, featuring the state-of-the-art EEG_GLT adjacency matrix method, has notably enhanced EEG MI signal classification, evidenced by an average accuracy of 83.95% across 20 subjects on the PhysioNet dataset. This significantly exceeds the 76.10% accuracy rate achieved using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) method within the same framework. In this research, we advance the field by applying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the classification of EEG MI signals. Our innovative method empowers the RL agent, enabling not only the classification of EEG MI data points with higher accuracy, but effective identification of EEG MI data points that are less distinct. We present the EEG_RL-Net, an enhancement of the EEG_GLT-Net framework, which incorporates the trained EEG GCN Block from EEG_GLT-Net at an adjacency matrix density of 13.39% alongside the RL-centric Dueling Deep Q Network (Dueling DQN) block. The EEG_RL-Net model showcases exceptional classification performance, achieving an unprecedented average accuracy of 96.40% across 20 subjects within 25 milliseconds. This model illustrates the transformative effect of the RL in EEG MI time point classification.</p></details> |  |

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 20 figures submitted to CMAME (Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering)</p></details> |

While single-drug effects on cell lines are well-documented, the scarcity of data on drug synergy, considering the vast array of potential drug combinations, prompts a growing interest in computational approaches for predicting synergies in untested drug pairs. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (\textit{GNN}) based model for drug synergy prediction, which utilizes drug chemical structures and cell line gene expression data. We extract data from the largest available drug combination database (DrugComb) and generate multiple synergy scores (commonly used in the literature) to create seven datasets that serve as a reliable benchmark with high confidence. In contrast to conventional models relying on pre-computed chemical features, our GNN-based approach learns task-specific drug representations directly from the graph structure of the drugs, providing superior performance in predicting drug synergies. Our work suggests that learning task-specific drug representations and leveraging a diverse dataset is a promising approach to advancing our understanding of drug-drug interaction and synergy.</p></details> |  |

Since GTs encode graph information without relying on message-passing mechanisms, conventional fairness-aware graph learning methods cannot be directly applicable to address these issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose FairGT, a Fairness-aware Graph Transformer explicitly crafted to mitigate fairness concerns inherent in GTs. FairGT incorporates a meticulous structural feature selection strategy and a multi-hop node feature integration method, ensuring independence of sensitive features and bolstering fairness considerations. These fairness-aware graph information encodings seamlessly integrate into the Transformer framework for downstream tasks. We also prove that the proposed fair structural topology encoding with adjacency matrix eigenvector selection and multi-hop integration are theoretically effective. Empirical evaluations conducted across five real-world datasets demonstrate FairGT's superiority in fairness metrics over existing graph transformers, graph neural networks, and state-of-the-art fairness-aware graph learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPGAN: A Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network for Missing Data Imputation in Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17164v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data imputation poses a paramount challenge when dealing with graph data. Prior works typically are based on feature propagation or graph autoencoders to address this issue. However, these methods usually encounter the over-smoothing issue when dealing with missing data, as the graph neural network (GNN) modules are not explicitly designed for handling missing data. This paper proposes a novel framework, called Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network (DPGAN), that can deal simultaneously with missing data and avoid over-smoothing problems. The crux of our work is that it admits both global and local representations of the input graph signal, which can capture the long-range dependencies. It is realized via our proposed generator, consisting of two key components, i.e., MLPUNet++ and GraphUNet++. Our generator is trained with a designated discriminator via an adversarial process. In particular, to avoid assessing the entire graph as did in the literature, our discriminator focuses on the local subgraph fidelity, thereby boosting the quality of the local imputation. The subgraph size is adjustable, allowing for control over the intensity of adversarial regularization. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmark datasets substantiate that DPGAN consistently rivals, if not outperforms, existing state-of-the-art imputation algorithms.

| **[HiHGNN: Accelerating HGNNs through Parallelism and Data Reusability Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12765v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as powerful algorithms for processing heterogeneous graphs (HetGs), widely used in many critical fields. To capture both structural and semantic information in HetGs, HGNNs first aggregate the neighboring feature vectors for each vertex in each semantic graph and then fuse the aggregated results across all semantic graphs for each vertex. Unfortunately, existing graph neural network accelerators are ill-suited to accelerate HGNNs. This is because they fail to efficiently tackle the specific execution patterns and exploit the high-degree parallelism as well as data reusability inside and across the processing of semantic graphs in HGNNs. In this work, we first quantitatively characterize a set of representative HGNN models on GPU to disclose the execution bound of each stage, inter-semantic-graph parallelism, and inter-semantic-graph data reusability in HGNNs. Guided by our findings, we propose a high-performance HGNN accelerator, HiHGNN, to alleviate the execution bound and exploit the newfound parallelism and data reusability in HGNNs. Specifically, we first propose a bound-aware stage-fusion methodology that tailors to HGNN acceleration, to fuse and pipeline the execution stages being aware of their execution bounds. Second, we design an independency-aware parallel execution design to exploit the inter-semantic-graph parallelism. Finally, we present a similarity-aware execution scheduling to exploit the inter-semantic-graph data reusability. Compared to the state-of-the-art software framework running on NVIDIA GPU T4 and GPU A100, HiHGNN respectively achieves an average 41.5$\times$ and 8.6$\times$ speedup as well as 106$\times$ and 73$\times$ energy efficiency with quarter the memory bandwidth of GPU A100.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 17 figures; To appear in IEEE TPDS 2024</p></details> |

Since the construction details are unknown for attackers in a black-box scenario, it is unrealistic to conduct the classical adversarial attacks that require a specific adjacency matrix. In this paper, we propose the first general black-box adversarial attack framework, i.e., General Attack via Fake Social Interaction (GAFSI), against detectors based on different graph structures. Specifically, as sharing is an important social interaction for GNN-based fake news detectors to construct the graph, we simulate sharing behaviors to fool the detectors. Firstly, we propose a fraudster selection module to select engaged users leveraging local and global information. In addition, a post injection module guides the selected users to create shared relations by sending posts. The sharing records will be added to the social context, leading to a general attack against different detectors. Experimental results on empirical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GAFSI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2024</p></details> |

Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND employs the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties of fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting. Experimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/zknus/ICLR2024-FROND}.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

Recent advancements utilize graph convolutional neural networks to extract features within graph structures. Despite promising results, these methods face challenges in real-world applications due to sparse features, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Recent studies draw inspiration from the mammalian brain and employ spiking neural networks to model and learn graph structures. However, these approaches are limited to traditional Von Neumann-based computing systems, which still face hardware inefficiencies. In this study, we present a fully neuromorphic implementation of spiking graph neural networks designed for Loihi 2. We optimize network parameters using Lava Bayesian Optimization, a novel hyperparameter optimization system compatible with neuromorphic computing architectures. We showcase the performance benefits of combining neuromorphic Bayesian optimization with our approach for citation graph classification using fixed-precision spiking neurons. Our results demonstrate the capability of integer-precision, Loihi 2 compatible spiking neural networks in performing citation graph classification with comparable accuracy to existing floating point implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Network reliability analysis commonly considers network-level performance and does not consider the more detailed node-level responses due to computational cost. In this paper, we propose a rapid seismic reliability assessment approach for bridge networks based on graph neural networks, where node-level connectivities, between points of interest and other nodes, are evaluated under probabilistic seismic scenarios. Via numerical experiments on transportation systems in California, we demonstrate the accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach compared to the Monte Carlo approach.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |
| **[HEroBM: a deep equivariant graph neural network for universal backmapping from coarse-grained to all-atom representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16911v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular simulations have assumed a paramount role in the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences, being able to capture the intricate dynamic properties of systems. Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.</p></details> |  |

To that end, we propose a method to extract global concept explanations from the predictions of graph neural networks to develop a deeper understanding of the tasks underlying structure-property relationships. We identify concept explanations as dense clusters in the self-explaining Megan models subgraph latent space. For each concept, we optimize a representative prototype graph and optionally use GPT-4 to provide hypotheses about why each structure has a certain effect on the prediction. We conduct computational experiments on synthetic and real-world graph property prediction tasks. For the synthetic tasks we find that our method correctly reproduces the structural rules by which they were created. For real-world molecular property regression and classification tasks, we find that our method rediscovers established rules of thumb. More specifically, our results for molecular mutagenicity prediction indicate more fine-grained resolution of structural details than existing explainability methods, consistent with previous results from chemistry literature. Overall, our results show promising capability to extract the underlying structure-property relationships for complex graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, accepted at xAI world conference 2024</p></details> |

The dataset comprises bone marrow samples from 30 patients, with each cell characterized by twelve markers. Ground truth labels identify five hematological cell types: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Monocytes, Mast cells, and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs). Experiments utilize supervised inductive learning and semi-supervised transductive learning on up to 1 million cells per patient. Baseline methods include Gaussian Mixture Models, XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs demonstrate superior performance by exploiting spatial relationships in graph-encoded data. The benchmark allows standardized evaluation of clinically relevant classification tasks, along with exploratory analyses to gain insights into hematological cell phenotypes. This represents the first public flow cytometry benchmark with a richly annotated, heterogeneous dataset. It will empower the development and rigorous assessment of novel methodologies for single-cell analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.18611</p></details> |
| **[IDEA: Invariant Defense for Graph Adversarial Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15792v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of graph neural networks (GNNs), their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses tremendous challenges for practical applications. Existing defense methods suffer from severe performance decline under unseen attacks, due to either limited observed adversarial examples or pre-defined heuristics. To address these limitations, we analyze the causalities in graph adversarial attacks and conclude that causal features are key to achieve graph adversarial robustness, owing to their determinedness for labels and invariance across attacks. To learn these causal features, we innovatively propose an Invariant causal DEfense method against adversarial Attacks (IDEA). We derive node-based and structure-based invariance objectives from an information-theoretic perspective. IDEA ensures strong predictability for labels and invariant predictability across attacks, which is provably a causally invariant defense across various attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDEA attains state-of-the-art defense performance under all five attacks on all five datasets. The implementation of IDEA is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IDEA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16366v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised graph anomaly detection aims at identifying rare patterns that deviate from the majority in a graph without the aid of labels, which is important for a variety of real-world applications. Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from solely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G3AD can outperform seventeen state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

We propose a flow-free model based on graph neural networks that predicts grid states at every generation of a cascade process given an initial contingency and power injection values. We train the proposed model using a cascade sequence data pool generated from simulations. We then evaluate our model at various levels of granularity. We present several error metrics that gauge the model's ability to predict the failure size, the final grid state, and the failure time steps of each branch within the cascade. We benchmark the graph neural network model against influence models. We show that, in addition to being generic over randomly scaled power injection values, the graph neural network model outperforms multiple influence models that are built specifically for their corresponding loading profiles. Finally, we show that the proposed model reduces the computational time by almost two orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm).

Then we systematically survey the representative methods along the three categories of the taxonomy. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research.
