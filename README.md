| **[Any-Quantile Probabilistic Forecasting of Short-Term Electricity Demand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17451v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power systems operate under uncertainty originating from multiple factors that are impossible to account for deterministically. Distributional forecasting is used to control and mitigate risks associated with this uncertainty. Recent progress in deep learning has helped to significantly improve the accuracy of point forecasts, while accurate distributional forecasting still presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel general approach for distributional forecasting capable of predicting arbitrary quantiles. We show that our general approach can be seamlessly applied to two distinct neural architectures leading to the state-of-the-art distributional forecasting results in the context of short-term electricity demand forecasting task. We empirically validate our method on 35 hourly electricity demand time-series for European countries. Our code is available here: https://github.com/boreshkinai/any-quantile.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separation capacity of linear reservoirs with random connectivity matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17429v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that the success of reservoir computing lies within the separation capacity of the reservoirs and show that the expected separation capacity of random linear reservoirs is fully characterised by the spectral decomposition of an associated generalised matrix of moments. Of particular interest are reservoirs with Gaussian matrices that are either symmetric or whose entries are all independent. In the symmetric case, we prove that the separation capacity always deteriorates with time; while for short inputs, separation with large reservoirs is best achieved when the entries of the matrix are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the dimension of the reservoir and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum length of the input time series. In the i.i.d. case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation in function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and the impact of the chosen architecture on separation consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Potential of AI for Spatially Sensitive Nature-Related Financial Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17369v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing recognition among financial institutions, financial regulators and policy makers of the importance of addressing nature-related risks and opportunities. Evaluating and assessing nature-related risks for financial institutions is challenging due to the large volume of heterogeneous data available on nature and the complexity of investment value chains and the various components' relationship to nature. The dual problem of scaling data analytics and analysing complex systems can be addressed using Artificial Intelligence (AI). We address issues such as plugging existing data gaps with discovered data, data estimation under uncertainty, time series analysis and (near) real-time updates. This report presents potential AI solutions for models of two distinct use cases, the Brazil Beef Supply Use Case and the Water Utility Use Case. Our two use cases cover a broad perspective within sustainable finance. The Brazilian cattle farming use case is an example of greening finance - integrating nature-related considerations into mainstream financial decision-making to transition investments away from sectors with poor historical track records and unsustainable operations. The deployment of nature-based solutions in the UK water utility use case is an example of financing green - driving investment to nature-positive outcomes. The two use cases also cover different sectors, geographies, financial assets and AI modelling techniques, providing an overview on how AI could be applied to different challenges relating to nature's integration into finance. This report is primarily aimed at financial institutions but is also of interest to ESG data providers, TNFD, systems modellers, and, of course, AI practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 10 figures, UKRI (NERC) Integrated Finance and Biodiversity for a Nature Positive Future Programme</p></details> |
| **[Bake off redux: a review and experimental evaluation of recent time series classification algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13029v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 2017, a research paper compared 18 Time Series Classification (TSC) algorithms on 85 datasets from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) archive. This study, commonly referred to as a `bake off', identified that only nine algorithms performed significantly better than the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Rotation Forest benchmarks that were used. The study categorised each algorithm by the type of feature they extract from time series data, forming a taxonomy of five main algorithm types. This categorisation of algorithms alongside the provision of code and accessible results for reproducibility has helped fuel an increase in popularity of the TSC field. Over six years have passed since this bake off, the UCR archive has expanded to 112 datasets and there have been a large number of new algorithms proposed. We revisit the bake off, seeing how each of the proposed categories have advanced since the original publication, and evaluate the performance of newer algorithms against the previous best-of-category using an expanded UCR archive. We extend the taxonomy to include three new categories to reflect recent developments. Alongside the originally proposed distance, interval, shapelet, dictionary and hybrid based algorithms, we compare newer convolution and feature based algorithms as well as deep learning approaches. We introduce 30 classification datasets either recently donated to the archive or reformatted to the TSC format, and use these to further evaluate the best performing algorithm from each category. Overall, we find that two recently proposed algorithms, Hydra+MultiROCKET and HIVE-COTEv2, perform significantly better than other approaches on both the current and new TSC problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Raising the ClaSS of Streaming Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20431v3)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ubiquitous sensors today emit high frequency streams of numerical measurements that reflect properties of human, animal, industrial, commercial, and natural processes. Shifts in such processes, e.g. caused by external events or internal state changes, manifest as changes in the recorded signals. The task of streaming time series segmentation (STSS) is to partition the stream into consecutive variable-sized segments that correspond to states of the observed processes or entities. The partition operation itself must in performance be able to cope with the input frequency of the signals. We introduce ClaSS, a novel, efficient, and highly accurate algorithm for STSS. ClaSS assesses the homogeneity of potential partitions using self-supervised time series classification and applies statistical tests to detect significant change points (CPs). In our experimental evaluation using two large benchmarks and six real-world data archives, we found ClaSS to be significantly more precise than eight state-of-the-art competitors. Its space and time complexity is independent of segment sizes and linear only in the sliding window size. We also provide ClaSS as a window operator with an average throughput of 1k data points per second for the Apache Flink streaming engine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Deterministic Renewable Energy Forecasting Guided by Multiple-Location Weather Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17276v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity generated from renewable energy sources has been established as an efficient remedy for both energy shortages and the environmental pollution stemming from conventional energy production methods. Solar and wind power are two of the most dominant renewable energy sources. The accurate forecasting of the energy generation of those sources facilitates their integration into electric grids, by minimizing the negative impact of uncertainty regarding their management and operation. This paper proposes a novel methodology for deterministic wind and solar energy generation forecasting for multiple generation sites, utilizing multi-location weather forecasts. The method employs a U-shaped Temporal Convolutional Auto-Encoder (UTCAE) architecture for temporal processing of weather-related and energy-related time-series across each site. The Multi-sized Kernels convolutional Spatio-Temporal Attention (MKST-Attention), inspired by the multi-head scaled-dot product attention mechanism, is also proposed aiming to efficiently transfer temporal patterns from weather data to energy data, without a priori knowledge of the locations of the power stations and the locations of provided weather data. The conducted experimental evaluation on a day-ahead solar and wind energy forecasting scenario on five datasets demonstrated that the proposed method achieves top results, outperforming all competitive time-series forecasting state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self Attention with Temporal Prior: Can We Learn More from Arrow of Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18932v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many diverse phenomena in nature often inherently encode both short- and long-term temporal dependencies, which especially result from the direction of the flow of time. In this respect, we discovered experimental evidence suggesting that interrelations of these events are higher for closer time stamps. However, to be able for attention-based models to learn these regularities in short-term dependencies, it requires large amounts of data, which are often infeasible. This is because, while they are good at learning piece-wise temporal dependencies, attention-based models lack structures that encode biases in time series. As a resolution, we propose a simple and efficient method that enables attention layers to better encode the short-term temporal bias of these data sets by applying learnable, adaptive kernels directly to the attention matrices. We chose various prediction tasks for the experiments using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data sets since they are great examples with underlying long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Our experiments show exceptional classification results compared to best-performing models on most tasks and data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[An adaptive standardisation methodology for Day-Ahead electricity price forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02610v3)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Day-Ahead prices in the electricity market is one of the most popular problems in time series forecasting. Previous research has focused on employing increasingly complex learning algorithms to capture the sophisticated dynamics of the market. However, there is a threshold where increased complexity fails to yield substantial improvements. In this work, we propose an alternative approach by introducing an adaptive standardisation to mitigate the effects of dataset shifts that commonly occur in the market. By doing so, learning algorithms can prioritize uncovering the true relationship between the target variable and the explanatory variables. We investigate five distinct markets, including two novel datasets, previously unexplored in the literature. These datasets provide a more realistic representation of the current market context, that conventional datasets do not show. The results demonstrate a significant improvement across all five markets using the widely accepted learning algorithms in the literature (LEAR and DNN). In particular, the combination of the proposed methodology with the methodology previously presented in the literature obtains the best results. This significant advancement unveils new lines of research in this field, highlighting the potential of adaptive transformations in enhancing the performance of forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensor Response-Time Reduction using Long-Short Term Memory Network Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17144v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The response time of a biosensor is a crucial metric in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnostics where an earlier diagnosis can markedly improve patient outcomes. However, the speed at which a biosensor reaches a final equilibrium state can be limited by poor mass transport and long molecular diffusion times that increase the time it takes target molecules to reach the active sensing region of a biosensor. While optimization of system and sensor design can promote molecules reaching the sensing element faster, a simpler and complementary approach for response time reduction that is widely applicable across all sensor platforms is to use time-series forecasting to predict the ultimate steady-state sensor response. In this work, we show that ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can accurately predict equilibrium biosensor response from a small quantity of initial time-dependent biosensor measurements, allowing for significant reduction in response time by a mean and median factor of improvement of 18.6 and 5.1, respectively. The ensemble of models also provides simultaneous estimation of uncertainty, which is vital to provide confidence in the predictions and subsequent safety-related decisions that are made. This approach is demonstrated on real-time experimental data collected by exposing porous silicon biosensors to buffered protein solutions using a multi-channel fluidic cell that enables the automated measurement of 100 porous silicon biosensors in parallel. The dramatic improvement in sensor response time achieved using LSTM network ensembles and associated uncertainty quantification opens the door to trustworthy and faster responding biosensors, enabling more rapid medical diagnostics for improved patient outcomes and healthcare access, as well as quicker identification of toxins in food and the environment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Distance Correlation-Based Approach to Characterize the Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15830v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has received a lot of attention, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) being one of the widely used models due to their ability to handle sequential data. Previous studies on RNN time series forecasting, however, show inconsistent outcomes and offer few explanations for performance variations among the datasets. In this paper, we provide an approach to link time series characteristics with RNN components via the versatile metric of distance correlation. This metric allows us to examine the information flow through the RNN activation layers to be able to interpret and explain their performance. We empirically show that the RNN activation layers learn the lag structures of time series well. However, they gradually lose this information over the span of a few consecutive layers, thereby worsening the forecast quality for series with large lag structures. We also show that the activation layers cannot adequately model moving average and heteroskedastic time series processes. Last, we generate heatmaps for visual comparisons of the activation layers for different choices of the network hyperparameters to identify which of them affect the forecast performance. Our findings can, therefore, aid practitioners in assessing the effectiveness of RNNs for given time series data without actually training and evaluating the networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-the-fly Data Augmentation for Forecasting with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16918v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches are increasingly used to tackle forecasting tasks. A key factor in the successful application of these methods is a large enough training sample size, which is not always available. In these scenarios, synthetic data generation techniques are usually applied to augment the dataset. Data augmentation is typically applied before fitting a model. However, these approaches create a single augmented dataset, potentially limiting their effectiveness. This work introduces OnDAT (On-the-fly Data Augmentation for Time series) to address this issue by applying data augmentation during training and validation. Contrary to traditional methods that create a single, static augmented dataset beforehand, OnDAT performs augmentation on-the-fly. By generating a new augmented dataset on each iteration, the model is exposed to a constantly changing augmented data variations. We hypothesize this process enables a better exploration of the data space, which reduces the potential for overfitting and improves forecasting performance. We validated the proposed approach using a state-of-the-art deep learning forecasting method and 8 benchmark datasets containing a total of 75797 time series. The experiments suggest that OnDAT leads to better forecasting performance than a strategy that applies data augmentation before training as well as a strategy that does not involve data augmentation. The method and experiments are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stage Aggregation with Dynamic Local Attention for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07744v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series data is characterized by varying time intervals between consecutive observations of measured variables/signals (i.e., features) and varying sampling rates (i.e., recordings/measurement) across these features. Modeling time series while taking into account these irregularities is still a challenging task for machine learning methods. Here, we introduce TADA, a Two-stageAggregation process with Dynamic local Attention to harmonize time-wise and feature-wise irregularities in multivariate time series. In the first stage, the irregular time series undergoes temporal embedding (TE) using all available features at each time step. This process preserves the contribution of each available feature and generates a fixed-dimensional representation per time step. The second stage introduces a dynamic local attention (DLA) mechanism with adaptive window sizes. DLA aggregates time recordings using feature-specific windows to harmonize irregular time intervals capturing feature-specific sampling rates. Then hierarchical MLP mixer layers process the output of DLA through multiscale patching to leverage information at various scales for the downstream tasks. TADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets, including the latest MIMIC IV dataset, and highlights its effectiveness in handling irregular multivariate time series and its potential for various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper has been accepted for presentation at the Findings of Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2023 conference</p></details> |
| **[Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time. In particular, for a Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate direct solves with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Time Series Feature Understanding: A Comprehensive Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16563v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for automatic time series analysis and reporting, which is a critical task across many domains, spanning healthcare, finance, climate, energy, and many more. In this paper, we propose a framework for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of LLMs on time series understanding, encompassing both univariate and multivariate forms. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of time series features, a critical framework that delineates various characteristics inherent in time series data. Leveraging this taxonomy, we have systematically designed and synthesized a diverse dataset of time series, embodying the different outlined features. This dataset acts as a solid foundation for assessing the proficiency of LLMs in comprehending time series. Our experiments shed light on the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in time series understanding, revealing which features these models readily comprehend effectively and where they falter. In addition, we uncover the sensitivity of LLMs to factors including the formatting of the data, the position of points queried within a series and the overall time series length.</p></details> |  |

By integrating a Bi-directional Kalman filter strategy utilizing forward and backward time-series processing, combined with a learnable motion model to represent complex motion patterns, our method significantly improves pose accuracy and robustness across various conditions, particularly for occluded or distant vehicles. Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset confirms that DeepKalPose outperforms existing methods in both pose accuracy and temporal consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 Figures, published to IET Electronic Letters</p></details> |
| **[Application of Long-Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks for Real-Time Bridge Scour Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16549v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scour around bridge piers is a critical challenge for infrastructures around the world. In the absence of analytical models and due to the complexity of the scour process, it is difficult for current empirical methods to achieve accurate predictions. In this paper, we exploit the power of deep learning algorithms to forecast the scour depth variations around bridge piers based on historical sensor monitoring data, including riverbed elevation, flow elevation, and flow velocity. We investigated the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time scour forecasting using data collected from bridges in Alaska and Oregon from 2006 to 2021. The LSTM models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.1m to 0.5m for predicting bed level variations a week in advance, showing a reasonable performance. The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) variant of CNN outperformed other CNN configurations, showing a comparable performance to LSTMs with significantly lower computational costs. We explored various innovative random-search heuristics for hyperparameter tuning and model optimisation which resulted in reduced computational cost compared to grid-search method. The impact of different combinations of sensor features on scour prediction showed the significance of the historical time series of scour for predicting upcoming events. Overall, this study provides a greater understanding of the potential of Deep Learning (DL) for real-time scour forecasting and early warning in bridges with diverse scour and flow characteristics including riverine and tidal/coastal bridges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-sensor super-resolution of irregularly sampled Sentinel-2 time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16409v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite imaging generally presents a trade-off between the frequency of acquisitions and the spatial resolution of the images. Super-resolution is often advanced as a way to get the best of both worlds. In this work, we investigate multi-image super-resolution of satellite image time series, i.e. how multiple images of the same area acquired at different dates can help reconstruct a higher resolution observation. In particular, we extend state-of-the-art deep single and multi-image super-resolution algorithms, such as SRDiff and HighRes-net, to deal with irregularly sampled Sentinel-2 time series. We introduce BreizhSR, a new dataset for 4x super-resolution of Sentinel-2 time series using very high-resolution SPOT-6 imagery of Brittany, a French region. We show that using multiple images significantly improves super-resolution performance, and that a well-designed temporal positional encoding allows us to perform super-resolution for different times of the series. In addition, we observe a trade-off between spectral fidelity and perceptual quality of the reconstructed HR images, questioning future directions for super-resolution of Earth Observation data.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16326v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications where the system dynamics has an underlying interdependency among its variables (such as power grid, economics, neuroscience, omics networks, environmental ecosystems, and others), one is often interested in knowing whether the past values of one time series influences the future of another, known as Granger causality, and the associated underlying dynamics. This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier Series Guided Design of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15377v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seasonal and Periodic Patterns of PM2.5 in Manhattan using the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08738v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air quality is a critical component of environmental health. Monitoring and analysis of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) plays a pivotal role in understanding air quality changes. This study focuses on the application of a new bandpass bootstrap approach, termed the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB), for analyzing time series data which provides modeled predictions of daily mean PM2.5 concentrations over 16 years in Manhattan, New York, the United States. The VBPBB can be used to explore periodically correlated (PC) principal components for this daily mean PM2.5 dataset. This method uses bandpass filters to isolate distinct PC components from datasets, removing unwanted interference including noise, and bootstraps the PC components. This preserves the PC structure and permits a better understanding of the periodic characteristics of time series data. The results of the VBPBB are compared against outcomes from alternative block bootstrapping techniques. The findings of this research indicate potential trends of elevated PM2.5 levels, providing evidence of significant semi-annual and weekly patterns missed by other methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Electricity Market Signals via Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743v3)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which future time series samples are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine-Learned Closure of URANS for Stably Stratified Turbulence: Connecting Physical Timescales & Data Hyperparameters of Deep Time-Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16141v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop time-series machine learning (ML) methods for closure modeling of the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations applied to stably stratified turbulence (SST). SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-Based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate Time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15360v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets. The project page is available on this website ~\url{https://github.com/badripatro/Simba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16112v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

| **[Exponentially Weighted Moving Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08136v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An exponentially weighted moving model (EWMM) for a vector time series fits a new data model each time period, based on an exponentially fading loss function on past observed data. The well known and widely used exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is a special case that estimates the mean using a square loss function. For quadratic loss functions EWMMs can be fit using a simple recursion that updates the parameters of a quadratic function. For other loss functions, the entire past history must be stored, and the fitting problem grows in size as time increases. We propose a general method for computing an approximation of EWMM, which requires storing only a window of a fixed number of past samples, and uses an additional quadratic term to approximate the loss associated with the data before the window. This approximate EWMM relies on convex optimization, and solves problems that do not grow with time. We compare the estimates produced by our approximation with the estimates from the exact EWMM method.</p></details> |  |

However, a prevalent real-world scenario involves structured data types, tabular and time-series, along with unstructured data. Such scenarios have been understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose LANISTR, an attention-based framework to learn from LANguage, Image, and STRuctured data. The core of LANISTR's methodology is rooted in \textit{masking-based} training applied across both unimodal and multimodal levels. In particular, we introduce a new similarity-based multimodal masking loss that enables it to learn cross-modal relations from large-scale multimodal data with missing modalities. On two real-world datasets, MIMIC-IV (from healthcare) and Amazon Product Review (from retail), LANISTR demonstrates remarkable improvements, 6.6\% (in AUROC) and 14\% (in accuracy) when fine-tuned with 0.1\% and 0.01\% of labeled data, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Notably, these improvements are observed even with very high ratio of samples (35.7\% and 99.8\% respectively) not containing all modalities, underlining the robustness of LANISTR to practical missing modality challenge. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/google-research/lanistr</p></details> |  |

In the past, standalone Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Network-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) were used to synthesize time-series data. However, they are inadequate for generating long sequences of time-series data due to limitations in the architecture. Furthermore, GANs are well known for their training instability and mode collapse problem. To address this, we propose TransFusion, a diffusion, and transformers-based generative model to generate high-quality long-sequence time-series data. We have stretched the sequence length to 384, and generated high-quality synthetic data. Also, we introduce two evaluation metrics to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data as well as its predictive characteristics. We evaluate TransFusion with a wide variety of visual and empirical metrics, and TransFusion outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the onset of stressful conditions on these joints is therefore important in order to ensure prevention of injuries as well as individualised training for enhanced athletic performance. We study the biomechanical joint angles from the hip, knee and ankle for runners who are experiencing fatigue. The data is cyclic in nature and densely collected by body worn sensors, which makes it ideal to work with in the functional data analysis (FDA) framework. We develop a new method for multiple change point detection for functional data, which improves the state of the art with respect to at least two novel aspects. First, the curves are compared with respect to their maximum absolute deviation, which leads to a better interpretation of local changes in the functional data compared to classical $L^2$-approaches. Secondly, as slight aberrations are to be often expected in a human movement data, our method will not detect arbitrarily small changes but hunts for relevant changes, where maximum absolute deviation between the curves exceeds a specified threshold, say $\Delta >0$. We recover multiple changes in a long functional time series of biomechanical knee angle data, which are larger than the desired threshold $\Delta$, allowing us to identify changes purely due to fatigue. In this work, we analyse data from both controlled indoor as well as from an uncontrolled outdoor (marathon) setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[POCKET: Pruning Random Convolution Kernels for Time Series Classification from a Feature Selection Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08499v3)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, two competitive time series classification models, namely, ROCKET and MINIROCKET, have garnered considerable attention due to their low training cost and high accuracy. However, they require a large number of random 1-D convolutional kernels to comprehensively capture features, which is incompatible with resource-constrained devices. Despite the development of heuristic algorithms designed to recognize and prune redundant kernels, the inherent time-consuming nature of evolutionary algorithms hinders efficient evaluation. To effectively prune models, this paper removes redundant random kernels from a feature selection perspective by eliminating associating connections in the sequential classifier. Two innovative algorithms are proposed, where the first ADMM-based algorithm formulates the pruning challenge as a group elastic net classification problem, and the second core algorithm named POCKET greatly accelerates the first one by bifurcating the problem into two sequential stages. Stage 1 of POCKET introduces dynamically varying penalties to efficiently implement group-level regularization to delete redundant kernels, and Stage 2 employs element-level regularization on the remaining features to refit a linear classifier for better performance. Experimental results on diverse time series datasets show that POCKET prunes up to 60% of kernels without a significant reduction in accuracy and performs 11 times faster than its counterparts. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ShaowuChen/POCKET.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of Transformers rises the challenge of balancing computaional efficiency and predicting performance. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba can well capture long-term dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. Mamba has shown great ability for long sequence modeling and is a potential competitor to Transformer-based models in LTSF. In this paper, we propose Bi-Mamba4TS, a bidirectional Mamba for time series forecasting. To address the sparsity of time series semantics, we adopt the patching technique to enrich the local information while capturing the evolutionary patterns of time series in a finer granularity. To select more appropriate modeling method based on the characteristics of the dataset, our model unifies the channel-independent and channel-mixing tokenization strategies and uses a series-relation-aware decider to control the strategy choosing process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show that our model achieves more accurate predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrated One-class Classification for Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12201v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is instrumental in maintaining system availability in various domains. Current work in this research line mainly focuses on learning data normality deeply and comprehensively by devising advanced neural network structures and new reconstruction/prediction learning objectives. However, their one-class learning process can be misled by latent anomalies in training data (i.e., anomaly contamination) under the unsupervised paradigm. Their learning process also lacks knowledge about the anomalies. Consequently, they often learn a biased, inaccurate normality boundary. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes calibrated one-class classification for anomaly detection, realizing contamination-tolerant, anomaly-informed learning of data normality via uncertainty modeling-based calibration and native anomaly-based calibration. Specifically, our approach adaptively penalizes uncertain predictions to restrain irregular samples in anomaly contamination during optimization, while simultaneously encouraging confident predictions on regular samples to ensure effective normality learning. This largely alleviates the negative impact of anomaly contamination. Our approach also creates native anomaly examples via perturbation to simulate time series abnormal behaviors. Through discriminating these dummy anomalies, our one-class learning is further calibrated to form a more precise normality boundary. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets show that our model achieves substantial improvement over sixteen state-of-the-art contenders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

Stock prices, temperature, etc are examples of time series data in real life. Time series data are used for forecasting sales, predicting trends. Visualization is the process of visually representing data or the relationship between features of a data either in a two-dimensional plot or a three-dimensional plot. Visualizing the time series data constitutes an important part of the process for working with a time series dataset. Visualizing the data not only helps in the modelling process but it can also be used to identify trends and features that cause those trends. In this work, we take a real-life time series dataset and analyse how the target feature relates to other features of the dataset through visualization. From the work that has been carried out, we present an effective method of visualization for time series data which will be much useful for machine learning modelling with such datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages.

| **[Motion Code: Robust Time series Classification and Forecasting via Sparse Variational Multi-Stochastic Processes Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14081v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being extensively studied, time series classification and forecasting on noisy data remain highly difficult. The main challenges lie in finding suitable mathematical concepts to describe time series and effectively separating noise from the true signals. Instead of treating time series as a static vector or a data sequence as often seen in previous methods, we introduce a novel framework that considers each time series, not necessarily of fixed length, as a sample realization of a continuous-time stochastic process. Such mathematical model explicitly captures the data dependence across several timestamps and detects the hidden time-dependent signals from noise. However, since the underlying data is often composed of several distinct dynamics, modeling using a single stochastic process is not sufficient. To handle such settings, we first assign each dynamics a signature vector. We then propose the abstract concept of the most informative timestamps to infer a sparse approximation of the individual dynamics based on their assigned vectors. The final model, referred to as Motion Code, contains parameters that can fully capture different underlying dynamics in an integrated manner. This allows unmixing classification and generation of specific sub-type forecasting simultaneously. Extensive experiments on sensors and devices noisy time series data demonstrate Motion Code's competitiveness against time series classification and forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

A good time-series dataset is advantageous for the model's accuracy, robustness, and convergence, as well as task outcomes and costs. The emergence of data-centric AI represents a shift in the landscape from model refinement to prioritizing data quality. Even though time-series data processing methods frequently come up in a wide range of research fields, it hasn't been well investigated as a specific topic. To fill the gap, in this paper, we systematically review different data-centric methods in time series analysis, covering a wide range of research topics. Based on the time-series data characteristics at sample, feature, and period, we propose a taxonomy for the reviewed data selection methods. In addition to discussing and summarizing their characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks targeting time-series data, we also introduce the challenges and opportunities by proposing recommendations, open problems, and possible research topics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

| **[Estimating the Distribution of Parameters in Differential Equations with Repeated Cross-Sectional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14873v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, offering insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). With RCS data, we found that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of time trajectories or Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, often leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method, Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD), providing accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimize the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, demonstrating its superiority in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions rather than a normal distribution. These results effectively address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

This motivates the objective of discovering typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing homogeneous groups of care pathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care pathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a semantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms. In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to time sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed sequences. This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Mamba and Transformer for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14757v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important problem and plays a key role in a variety of applications including weather forecasting, stock market, and scientific simulations. Although transformers have proven to be effective in capturing dependency, its quadratic complexity of attention mechanism prevents its further adoption in long-range time series forecasting, thus limiting them attend to short-range range. Recent progress on state space models (SSMs) have shown impressive performance on modeling long range dependency due to their subquadratic complexity. Mamba, as a representative SSM, enjoys linear time complexity and has achieved strong scalability on tasks that requires scaling to long sequences, such as language, audio, and genomics. In this paper, we propose to leverage a hybrid framework Mambaformer that internally combines Mamba for long-range dependency, and Transformer for short range dependency, for long-short range forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to combine Mamba and Transformer architecture in time series data. We investigate possible hybrid architectures to combine Mamba layer and attention layer for long-short range time series forecasting. The comparative study shows that the Mambaformer family can outperform Mamba and Transformer in long-short range time series forecasting problem.

| **[Fixation-based Self-calibration for Eye Tracking in VR Headsets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00391v2)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a novel self-calibration method for eye tracking in a virtual reality (VR) headset. The proposed method is based on the assumptions that the user's viewpoint can freely move and that the points of regard (PoRs) from different viewpoints are distributed within a small area on an object surface during visual fixation. In the method, fixations are first detected from the time-series data of uncalibrated gaze directions using an extension of the I-VDT (velocity and dispersion threshold identification) algorithm to a three-dimensional (3D) scene. Then, the calibration parameters are optimized by minimizing the sum of a dispersion metrics of the PoRs. The proposed method can potentially identify the optimal calibration parameters representing the user-dependent offset from the optical axis to the visual axis without explicit user calibration, image processing, or marker-substitute objects. For the gaze data of 18 participants walking in two VR environments with many occlusions, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 2.1$^\circ$, which was significantly lower than the average offset. Our method is the first self-calibration method with an average error lower than 3$^\circ$ in 3D environments. Further, the accuracy of the proposed method can be improved by up to 1.2$^\circ$ by refining the fixation detection or optimization algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Transformer for Electrocardiogram Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07136v3)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of Transformer for ECG data has not been fully realized, despite their widespread success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present Masked Transformer for ECG classification (MTECG), a simple yet effective method which significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification. Our approach adapts the image-based masked autoencoders to self-supervised representation learning from ECG time series. We utilize a lightweight Transformer for the encoder and a 1-layer Transformer for the decoder. The ECG signal is split into a sequence of non-overlapping segments along the time dimension, and learnable positional embeddings are added to preserve the sequential information. We construct the Fuwai dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of diagnoses, annotated by medical experts, to explore the potential of Transformer. A strong pre-training and fine-tuning recipe is proposed from the empirical study. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method increases the macro F1 scores by 3.4%-27.5% on the Fuwai dataset, 9.9%-32.0% on the PTB-XL dataset, and 9.4%-39.1% on a multicenter dataset, compared to the alternative methods. We hope that this study could direct future research on the application of Transformer to more ECG tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>more ...</summary><p>more experimental results; more implementation details; different abstracts</p></details> |
| **[Identifying sparse treatment effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14644v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on technological advances in sensing modalities, randomized trials with primary outcomes represented as high-dimensional vectors have become increasingly prevalent. For example, these outcomes could be week-long time-series data from wearable devices or high-dimensional neuroimaging data, such as from functional magnetic resonance imaging. This paper focuses on randomized treatment studies with such high-dimensional outcomes characterized by sparse treatment effects, where interventions may influence a small number of dimensions, e.g., small temporal windows or specific brain regions. Conventional practices, such as using fixed, low-dimensional summaries of the outcomes, result in significantly reduced power for detecting treatment effects. To address this limitation, we propose a procedure that involves subset selection followed by inference. Specifically, given a potentially large set of outcome summaries, we identify the subset that captures treatment effects, which requires only one call to the Lasso, and subsequently conduct inference on the selected subset. Via theoretical analysis as well as simulations, we demonstrate that our method asymptotically selects the correct subset and increases statistical power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Inventory Control in Networks via Hindsight Differentiable Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11246v2)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that inventory management presents unique opportunities for reliably applying and evaluating deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Toward reliable application, we emphasize and test two techniques. The first is Hindsight Differentiable Policy Optimization (HDPO), which performs stochastic gradient descent to optimize policy performance while avoiding the need to repeatedly deploy randomized policies in the environment-as is common with generic policy gradient methods. Our second technique involves aligning policy (neural) network architectures with the structure of the inventory network. Specifically, we focus on a network with a single warehouse that consolidates inventory from external suppliers, holds it, and then distributes it to many stores as needed. In this setting, we introduce the symmetry-aware policy network architecture. We motivate this architecture by establishing an asymptotic performance guarantee and empirically demonstrate its ability to reduce the amount of data needed to uncover strong policies. Both techniques exploit structures inherent in inventory management problems, moving beyond generic DRL algorithms. Toward rigorous evaluation, we create and share new benchmark problems, divided into two categories. One type focuses on problems with hidden structures that allow us to compute or bound the cost of the true optimal policy. Across four problems of this type, we find HDPO consistently attains near-optimal performance, handling up to 60-dimensional raw state vectors effectively. The other type of evaluation involves constructing a test problem using real time series data from a large retailer, where the optimum is poorly understood. Here, we find HDPO methods meaningfully outperform a variety of generalized newsvendor heuristics. Our code can be found at github.com/MatiasAlvo/Neural_inventory_control.</p></details> |  |

The concept of digital twins (DTs) has emerged as a solution to enable real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and decision-making processes. While existing works primarily focus on leveraging DTs to optimize wireless networks, a detailed mapping methodology for creating virtual representations of network infrastructure and properties is still lacking. In this context, we introduce VH-Twin, a novel time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital reality. VH-Twin distinguishes itself through complementary vertical twinning (V-twinning) and horizontal twinning (H-twinning) stages, followed by a periodic clustering mechanism used to virtualize network regions based on their distinct geological and wireless characteristics. Specifically, V-twinning exploits distributed learning techniques to initialize a global twin model collaboratively from virtualized network clusters. H-twinning, on the other hand, is implemented with an asynchronous mapping scheme that dynamically updates twin models in response to network or environmental changes. Leveraging real-world wireless traffic data within a cellular wireless network, comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify that VH-Twin can effectively construct, deploy, and maintain network DTs. Parametric analysis also offers insights into how to strike a balance between twinning efficiency and model accuracy at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IFIP/IEEE Networking 2024</p></details> |

We propose to generalize this problem by allowing the terminal distribution to differ from the target but penalizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We call this new control problem soft-constrained Schr\"{o}dinger bridge (SSB). The main contribution of this work is a theoretical derivation of the solution to SSB, which shows that the terminal distribution of the optimally controlled process is a geometric mixture of the target and some other distribution. This result is further extended to a time series setting. One application is the development of robust generative diffusion models. We propose a score matching-based algorithm for sampling from geometric mixtures and showcase its use via a numerical example for the MNIST data set.</p></details> | <details><summary>Made ...</summary><p>Made minor changes about the references. 38 pages, 7 figures.

| **[SOFTS: Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Series-Core Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14197v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Dispatch (STAD) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, e.g., attention, STAD employs a centralized strategy. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively. SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAD module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. For further research and development, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3)-Equivariant and Noise-Invariant 3D Rigid Motion Tracking in Brain MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13534v2)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigid motion tracking is paramount in many medical imaging applications where movements need to be detected, corrected, or accounted for. Modern strategies rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pose this problem as rigid registration. Yet, CNNs do not exploit natural symmetries in this task, as they are equivariant to translations (their outputs shift with their inputs) but not to rotations. Here we propose EquiTrack, the first method that uses recent steerable SE(3)-equivariant CNNs (E-CNN) for motion tracking. While steerable E-CNNs can extract corresponding features across different poses, testing them on noisy medical images reveals that they do not have enough learning capacity to learn noise invariance. Thus, we introduce a hybrid architecture that pairs a denoiser with an E-CNN to decouple the processing of anatomically irrelevant intensity features from the extraction of equivariant spatial features.

| **[Time Series Continuous Modeling for Imputation and Forecasting with Implicit Neural Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05880v5)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel modeling approach for time series imputation and forecasting, tailored to address the challenges often encountered in real-world data, such as irregular samples, missing data, or unaligned measurements from multiple sensors. Our method relies on a continuous-time-dependent model of the series' evolution dynamics. It leverages adaptations of conditional, implicit neural representations for sequential data. A modulation mechanism, driven by a meta-learning algorithm, allows adaptation to unseen samples and extrapolation beyond observed time-windows for long-term predictions. The model provides a highly flexible and unified framework for imputation and forecasting tasks across a wide range of challenging scenarios. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical benchmarks and outperforms alternative time-continuous models.</p></details> |  |

We train NCA to learn complex dynamics from time series of images and PDE trajectories. Our method is designed to identify underlying local rules that govern large scale dynamic emergent behaviours. Previous work on NCA focuses on learning rules that give stationary emergent structures. We extend NCA to capture both transient and stable structures within the same system, as well as learning rules that capture the dynamics of Turing pattern formation in nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We demonstrate that NCA can generalise very well beyond their PDE training data, we show how to constrain NCA to respect given symmetries, and we explore the effects of associated hyperparameters on model performance and stability. Being able to learn arbitrary dynamics gives NCA great potential as a data driven modelling framework, especially for modelling biological pattern formation.</p></details> | <details><summary>For v...</summary><p>For videos referenced in appendix, see: https://github.com/AlexDR1998/NCA/tree/main/Videos</p></details> |

LRSM with the usual window parameter $h$ is more satisfied to be used in long-time series with few and even change-points vs. LRSM with the multiple window parameter $h_{mix}$ performs well in short-time series with large and dense change-points. The computational complexity of LRSM can be efficiently performed with order $O((\log n)^3 n)$. Moreover, two bootstrap procedures, namely parametric and block bootstrap, are developed for constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for each of the change-points. Simulation experiments and real data analysis show that the LRSM and bootstrap procedures have excellent performance and are consistent with the theoretical analysis.</p></details> | 41 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Change-point analysis for binomial autoregressive model with application to price stability counts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13825v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The first-order binomial autoregressive (BAR(1)) model is the most frequently used tool to analyze the bounded count time series. The BAR(1) model is stationary and assumes process parameters to remain constant throughout the time period, which may be incompatible with the non-stationary real data, which indicates piecewise stationary characteristic. To better analyze the non-stationary bounded count time series, this article introduces the BAR(1) process with multiple change-points, which contains the BAR(1) model as a special case. Our primary goals are not only to detect the change-points, but also to give a solution to estimate the number and locations of the change-points. For this, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) test and minimum description length (MDL) principle are employed to deal with the testing and estimation problems. The proposed approaches are also applied to analysis of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices of the European Union.</p></details> | 42 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Distributed ARIMA Models for Ultra-long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09577v4)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing forecasts for ultra-long time series plays a vital role in various activities, such as investment decisions, industrial production arrangements, and farm management. This paper develops a novel distributed forecasting framework to tackle challenges associated with forecasting ultra-long time series by using the industry-standard MapReduce framework. The proposed model combination approach facilitates distributed time series forecasting by combining the local estimators of time series models delivered from worker nodes and minimizing a global loss function. In this way, instead of unrealistically assuming the data generating process (DGP) of an ultra-long time series stays invariant, we make assumptions only on the DGP of subseries spanning shorter time periods. We investigate the performance of the proposed approach with AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models using the real data application as well as numerical simulations. Compared to directly fitting the whole data with ARIMA models, our approach results in improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency both in point forecasts and prediction intervals, especially for longer forecast horizons. Moreover, we explore some potential factors that may affect the forecasting performance of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Forecasting (2023)</p></details> |

Three use cases are investigated. First, we show that extrapolating from few pricer examples leads to sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient results so that our algorithm can serve as a pricing framework. The second use case concerns reverse stress testing, which is formulated as an inversion function problem and is treated here via an optimal transport technique in combination with the notions of kernel-based encoders, decoders, and generators. Third, we show that standard techniques for time series analysis can be enhanced by using the proposed generative algorithms. Namely, we use our algorithm in order to extend the validity of any given quantitative model. Our approach allows for conditional analysis as well as for escaping the `Gaussian world'. This latter property is illustrated here with a portfolio investment strategy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley & Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.</p></details> |  |

We address the mislabeling issue in real-time HMDs, where benign segments in malware time-series incorrectly inherit malware labels, leading to increased false positives. Utilizing the proposed Malicious Discriminative Score within the MIL framework, RT-HMD effectively identifies localized malware behaviors, thereby improving the predictive accuracy. Empirical analysis, using a hardware telemetry dataset collected from a mobile platform across 723 benign and 1033 malware samples, shows a 5% precision boost while maintaining recall, outperforming baselines affected by mislabeled benign segments.</p></details> | Under peer review |

Augmenting smart thermostats (STs) with per-room sensors has gained acceptance by major ST manufacturers. This paper leverages additional sensory information to empirically characterize the services provided by buildings, including thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and demand response (DR). Utilizing room-level time-series data from 1,000 houses, metadata from 110,000 houses across the United States, and data from two real-world testbeds, we examine the limitations of SZMRHs and explore the potential of remote sensors. We discovered that comfortable DR durations (CDRDs) for rooms are typically 70% longer or 40% shorter than for the room with the thermostat. When averaging, rooms at the control temperature's bounds are typically deviated around -3{\deg}F to 2.5{\deg}F from the average. Moreover, in 95\% of houses, we identified rooms experiencing notably higher solar gains compared to the rest of the rooms, while 85% and 70% of houses demonstrated lower heat input and poor insulation, respectively. Lastly, it became evident that the consumption of cooling energy escalates with the increase in the number of sensors, whereas heating usage experiences fluctuations ranging from -19% to +25% This study serves as a benchmark for assessing the thermal comfort and DR services in the existing housing stock, while also highlighting the energy efficiency impacts of sensing technologies. Our approach sets the stage for more granular, precise control strategies of SZMRHs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Fi...</summary><p>13 Figures, 8 Tables, 25 Pages.

| **[Event-Based Contrastive Learning for Medical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10308v3)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical practice, one often needs to identify whether a patient is at high risk of adverse outcomes after some key medical event. For example, quantifying the risk of adverse outcomes after an acute cardiovascular event helps healthcare providers identify those patients at the highest risk of poor outcomes; i.e., patients who benefit from invasive therapies that can lower their risk. Assessing the risk of adverse outcomes, however, is challenging due to the complexity, variability, and heterogeneity of longitudinal medical data, especially for individuals suffering from chronic diseases like heart failure. In this paper, we introduce Event-Based Contrastive Learning (EBCL) - a method for learning embeddings of heterogeneous patient data that preserves temporal information before and after key index events. We demonstrate that EBCL can be used to construct models that yield improved performance on important downstream tasks relative to other pretraining methods. We develop and test the method using a cohort of heart failure patients obtained from a large hospital network and the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset consisting of patients in an intensive care unit at a large tertiary care center. On both cohorts, EBCL pretraining yields models that are performant with respect to a number of downstream tasks, including mortality, hospital readmission, and length of stay. In addition, unsupervised EBCL embeddings effectively cluster heart failure patients into subgroups with distinct outcomes, thereby providing information that helps identify new heart failure phenotypes. The contrastive framework around the index event can be adapted to a wide array of time-series datasets and provides information that can be used to guide personalized care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Unifying Representations in Neural Models Workshop in NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Position Paper: An Integrated Perspective on Data, Metrics, and Methodology for Deep Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07446v3)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep time-series forecasting plays an integral role in numerous practical applications. However, existing research fall short by focusing narrowly on either neural architecture designs for long-term point forecasts or probabilistic models for short-term scenarios. By proposing a comprehensive framework, facilitated by a novel tool, ProbTS, that integrates diverse data scenarios, evaluation metrics, and methodological focuses, we aim to transcend the limitations of current forecasting practices. Rigorous experimentation uncovers pivotal insights, including the supreme importance of aligning forecasting methodologies with the unique characteristics of the data; the necessity of a broad spectrum of metrics for accurately assessing both point and distributional forecasts; and the challenges inherent in adapting existing forecasting methods to a wider range of scenarios. These findings not only challenge conventional approaches but also illuminate promising avenues for future research, suggesting a more nuanced and effective strategy for advancing the field of deep time-series forecasting.</p></details> | Under Review |

When theinnovations are dependent, this asymptotic distributions can be quite different from that of PVAR models with in-dependent and identically distributed (iid for short) innovations developed in Ursu and Duchesne (2009). Modifiedversions of the Wald tests are proposed for testing linear restrictions on the parameters. These asymptotic results are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments. An application to a bivariate real financial data is also proposed</p></details> |  |
| **[CP Factor Model for Dynamic Tensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15517v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observations in various applications are frequently represented as a time series of multidimensional arrays, called tensor time series, preserving the inherent multidimensional structure. In this paper, we present a factor model approach, in a form similar to tensor CP decomposition, to the analysis of high-dimensional dynamic tensor time series. As the loading vectors are uniquely defined but not necessarily orthogonal, it is significantly different from the existing tensor factor models based on Tucker-type tensor decomposition. The model structure allows for a set of uncorrelated one-dimensional latent dynamic factor processes, making it much more convenient to study the underlying dynamics of the time series. A new high order projection estimator is proposed for such a factor model, utilizing the special structure and the idea of the higher order orthogonal iteration procedures commonly used in Tucker-type tensor factor model and general tensor CP decomposition procedures. Theoretical investigation provides statistical error bounds for the proposed methods, which shows the significant advantage of utilizing the special model structure. Simulation study is conducted to further demonstrate the finite sample properties of the estimators. Real data application is used to illustrate the model and its interpretations.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoCast++: Enhancing World Event Prediction with Zero-shot Ranking-based Context Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01880v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-based prediction of real-world events is garnering attention due to its potential for informed decision-making. Whereas traditional forecasting predominantly hinges on structured data like time-series, recent breakthroughs in language models enable predictions using unstructured text. In particular, (Zou et al., 2022) unveils AutoCast, a new benchmark that employs news articles for answering forecasting queries. Nevertheless, existing methods still trail behind human performance. The cornerstone of accurate forecasting, we argue, lies in identifying a concise, yet rich subset of news snippets from a vast corpus. With this motivation, we introduce AutoCast++, a zero-shot ranking-based context retrieval system, tailored to sift through expansive news document collections for event forecasting. Our approach first re-ranks articles based on zero-shot question-passage relevance, honing in on semantically pertinent news. Following this, the chosen articles are subjected to zero-shot summarization to attain succinct context. Leveraging a pre-trained language model, we conduct both the relevance evaluation and article summarization without needing domain-specific training. Notably, recent articles can sometimes be at odds with preceding ones due to new facts or unanticipated incidents, leading to fluctuating temporal dynamics. To tackle this, our re-ranking mechanism gives preference to more recent articles, and we further regularize the multi-passage representation learning to align with human forecaster responses made on different dates. Empirical results underscore marked improvements across multiple metrics, improving the performance for multiple-choice questions (MCQ) by 48% and true/false (TF) questions by up to 8%.

| **[A tutorial on spatiotemporal partially observed Markov process models via the R package spatPomp](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01157v4)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a computational framework for modeling and statistical inference on high-dimensional stochastic dynamic systems. Our primary motivation is the investigation of metapopulation dynamics arising from a collection of spatially distributed, interacting biological populations. To make progress on this goal, we embed it in a more general problem: inference for a collection of interacting partially observed nonlinear non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Each process in the collection is called a unit; in the case of spatiotemporal models, the units correspond to distinct spatial locations. The dynamic state for each unit may be discrete or continuous, scalar or vector valued. In metapopulation applications, the state can represent a structured population or the abundances of a collection of species at a single location. We consider models where the collection of states has a Markov property. A sequence of noisy measurements is made on each unit, resulting in a collection of time series. A model of this form is called a spatiotemporal partially observed Markov process (SpatPOMP). The R package spatPomp provides an environment for implementing SpatPOMP models, analyzing data using existing methods, and developing new inference approaches. Our presentation of spatPomp reviews various methodologies in a unifying notational framework. We demonstrate the package on a simple Gaussian system and on a nontrivial epidemiological model for measles transmission within and between cities. We show how to construct user-specified SpatPOMP models within spatPomp.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal biosignals often exhibit substantial distributional shifts between pretraining and inference datasets, stemming from changes in task specification or variations in modality compositions. To achieve effective pretraining in the presence of potential distributional shifts, we propose a frequency-aware masked autoencoder ($\texttt{bio}$FAME) that learns to parameterize the representation of biosignals in the frequency space. $\texttt{bio}$FAME incorporates a frequency-aware transformer, which leverages a fixed-size Fourier-based operator for global token mixing, independent of the length and sampling rate of inputs. To maintain the frequency components within each input channel, we further employ a frequency-maintain pretraining strategy that performs masked autoencoding in the latent space. The resulting architecture effectively utilizes multimodal information during pretraining, and can be seamlessly adapted to diverse tasks and modalities at test time, regardless of input size and order. We evaluated our approach on a diverse set of transfer experiments on unimodal time series, achieving an average of $\uparrow$5.5% improvement in classification accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our architecture is robust in modality mismatch scenarios, including unpredicted modality dropout or substitution, proving its practical utility in real-world applications.

One method for dealing with missing data is the concept of amplitude modulation. While this principle works with any data, here, missing data for unbounded and bounded count time series are investigated, where tailor-made dispersion and skewness statistics are used for model diagnostics. General closed-form asymptotic formulas are derived for such statistics with only weak assumptions on the underlying process. Moreover, closed-form formulas are derived for the popular special cases of Poisson and binomial autoregressive processes, always under the assumption that missingness occurs. The finite-sample performances of the considered asymptotic approximations are analyzed with simulations. The practical application of the corresponding dispersion and skewness tests under missing data is demonstrated with three real-data examples.</p></details> | 55 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Time-Inhomogeneous Markov Model for Resource Availability under Sparse Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12240v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatio-temporal information about the current situation is crucial for smart city applications such as modern routing algorithms. Often, this information describes the state of stationary resources, e.g. the availability of parking bays, charging stations or the amount of people waiting for a vehicle to pick them up near a given location. To exploit this kind of information, predicting future states of the monitored resources is often mandatory because a resource might change its state within the time until it is needed. To train an accurate predictive model, it is often not possible to obtain a continuous time series on the state of the resource. For example, the information might be collected from traveling agents visiting the resource with an irregular frequency. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods which work on sparse observations for training and prediction. In this paper, we propose time-inhomogeneous discrete Markov models to allow accurate prediction even when the frequency of observation is very rare. Our new model is able to blend recent observations with historic data and also provide useful probabilistic estimates for future states. Since resources availability in a city is typically time-dependent, our Markov model is time-inhomogeneous and cyclic within a predefined time interval. To train our model, we propose a modified Baum-Welch algorithm. Evaluations on real-world datasets of parking bay availability show that our new method indeed yields good results compared to methods being trained on complete data and non-cyclic variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, long version of a paper published at 26th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL 2018)</p></details> |
| **[Warped Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12134v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of detecting time series outliers, focusing on systems with repetitive behavior, such as industrial robots operating on production lines.Notable challenges arise from the fact that a task performed multiple times may exhibit different duration in each repetition and that the time series reported by the sensors are irregularly sampled because of data gaps. The anomaly detection approach presented in this paper consists of three stages.The first stage identifies the repetitive cycles in the lengthy time series and segments them into individual time series corresponding to one task cycle, while accounting for possible temporal distortions.The second stage computes a prototype for the cycles using a GPU-based barycenter algorithm, specifically tailored for very large time series.The third stage uses the prototype to detect abnormal cycles by computing an anomaly score for each cycle.The overall approach, named WarpEd Time Series ANomaly Detection (WETSAND), makes use of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and its variants because they are suited to the distorted nature of the time series.The experiments show that \wetsand scales to large signals, computes human-friendly prototypes, works with very little data, and outperforms some general purpose anomaly detection approaches such as autoencoders.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |

However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging. Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information. In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label. We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride. We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands. We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance. Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.

| **[Toward Short-Term Glucose Prediction Solely Based on CGM Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11924v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global diabetes epidemic highlights the importance of maintaining good glycemic control. Glucose prediction is a fundamental aspect of diabetes management, facilitating real-time decision-making. Recent research has introduced models focusing on long-term glucose trend prediction, which are unsuitable for real-time decision-making and result in delayed responses. Conversely, models designed to respond to immediate glucose level changes cannot analyze glucose variability comprehensively. Moreover, contemporary research generally integrates various physiological parameters (e.g. insulin doses, food intake, etc.), which inevitably raises data privacy concerns. To bridge such a research gap, we propose TimeGlu -- an end-to-end pipeline for short-term glucose prediction solely based on CGM time series data. We implement four baseline methods to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the model's performance. Through extensive experiments on two contrasting datasets (CGM Glucose and Colas dataset), TimeGlu achieves state-of-the-art performance without the need for additional personal data from patients, providing effective guidance for real-world diabetic glucose management.</p></details> |  |

Many comparisons of different approaches either use benchmarks composed of data from many different domains, inaccessible data or one of the few publicly available datasets which lack detailed information about the faults. Moreover, many publications highlight a couple of case studies where fault detection was successful. With this paper we publish a high quality dataset that contains data from 36 wind turbines across 3 different wind farms as well as the most detailed fault information of any public wind turbine dataset as far as we know. The new dataset contains 89 years worth of real-world operating data of wind turbines, distributed across 44 labeled time frames for anomalies that led up to faults, as well as 51 time series representing normal behavior. Additionally, the quality of training data is ensured by turbine-status-based labels for each data point. Furthermore, we propose a new scoring method, called CARE (Coverage, Accuracy, Reliability and Earliness), which takes advantage of the information depth that is present in the dataset to identify a good all-around anomaly detection model. This score considers the anomaly detection performance, the ability to recognize normal behavior properly and the capability to raise as few false alarms as possible while simultaneously detecting anomalies early.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures |
| **[HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a manuscript that is still in the process of revision, including Table 1, Figure 2, problem definition in section III.B and method description proposed in section IV.

Leveraging such analytical frameworks can yield transformative impacts, including the informed refinement of public policy and the identification of key drivers affecting a country's economic evolution. We employ Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to shed light on national happiness indices, economic freedom, and population metrics, spanning variable time frames. Acknowledging the presence of missing values, we employ three imputation approaches to generate robust multivariate time-series datasets apt for LIME's input requirements. Our methodology's efficacy is substantiated through a series of empirical evaluations involving multiple datasets. These evaluations include comparative analyses against random feature selection, correlation with real-world events as elucidated by LIME, and validation through Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a state-of-the-art technique proficient in feature importance detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are 9 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

Recent research has abandoned Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and utilized dilated convolutions or temporal slicing for feature extraction, and they have the following drawbacks: (1) Dilated convolutions fail to capture the features of adjacent time steps, resulting in the loss of crucial transitional data. (2) The connections within the same temporal slice are strong, while the connections between different temporal slices are too loose. In light of these limitations, we emphasize the importance of analyzing a complete time series repeatedly and the crucial role of GRU in MTS. Therefore, we propose SGRU: Structured Gated Recurrent Units, which involve structured GRU layers and non-linear units, along with multiple layers of time embedding to enhance the model's fitting performance. We evaluate our approach on four publicly available California traffic datasets: PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, and PeMS08 for regression prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models with average improvements of 11.7%, 18.6%, 18.5%, and 12.0% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Language Models Still Struggle to Zero-shot Reason about Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11757v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are critical for decision-making in fields like finance and healthcare. Their importance has driven a recent influx of works passing time series into language models, leading to non-trivial forecasting on some datasets. But it remains unknown whether non-trivial forecasting implies that language models can reason about time series. To address this gap, we generate a first-of-its-kind evaluation framework for time series reasoning, including formal tasks and a corresponding dataset of multi-scale time series paired with text captions across ten domains. Using these data, we probe whether language models achieve three forms of reasoning: (1) Etiological Reasoning - given an input time series, can the language model identify the scenario that most likely created it? (2) Question Answering - can a language model answer factual questions about time series? (3) Context-Aided Forecasting - does highly relevant textual context improve a language model's time series forecasts? We find that otherwise highly-capable language models demonstrate surprisingly limited time series reasoning: they score marginally above random on etiological and question answering tasks (up to 30 percentage points worse than humans) and show modest success in using context to improve forecasting. These weakness showcase that time series reasoning is an impactful, yet deeply underdeveloped direction for language model research. We also make our datasets and code public at to support further research in this direction at https://github.com/behavioral-data/TSandLanguage</p></details> |  |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset. The proposed method demonstrates slight advantages in clustering and strong advantages in runtime, especially for long trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2023 IEEE-RAS 22nd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids).

| **[Neural Interaction Energy for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16579v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining temporal stability is crucial in multi-agent trajectory prediction. Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[GADformer: A Transparent Transformer Model for Group Anomaly Detection on Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09841v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Anomaly Detection (GAD) identifies unusual pattern in groups where individual members might not be anomalous. This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |
| **[PTT: Point-Trajectory Transformer for Efficient Temporal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08371v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent temporal LiDAR-based 3D object detectors achieve promising performance based on the two-stage proposal-based approach. They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

The framework utilizes spatiotemporal occupancy grid maps (SOGM), which forecast the occupancy status of neighboring space in the near future, as the environment representation. Based on this representation, we extend the kinodynamic A* and the corridor-constrained trajectory optimization algorithms to efficiently tackle static and dynamic obstacles with arbitrary shapes. Collision avoidance between communicating robots is integrated by sharing planned trajectories and projecting them onto the SOGM. The simulation results show that our method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods in dynamic environments with different numbers and shapes of obstacles. Finally, the proposed method is validated in real experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, accepted to the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2024)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v4)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories. This study underscores the potential of VT-Former and its architecture, opening new avenues for future research and exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completely updated based on the reviews received for the paper</p></details> |

However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatiotemporal Hand-Eye Calibration for Trajectory Alignment in Visual(-Inertial) Odometry Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14894v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common prerequisite for evaluating a visual(-inertial) odometry (VO/VIO) algorithm is to align the timestamps and the reference frame of its estimated trajectory with a reference ground-truth derived from a system of superior precision, such as a motion capture system. The trajectory-based alignment, typically modeled as a classic hand-eye calibration, significantly influences the accuracy of evaluation metrics. However, traditional calibration methods are susceptible to the quality of the input poses. Few studies have taken this into account when evaluating VO/VIO trajectories that usually suffer from noise and drift. To fill this gap, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hand-eye calibration algorithm that fully leverages multiple constraints from screw theory for enhanced accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that our algorithm has better performance and is less noise-prone than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v3)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped locations. Numerous methods exist that target different tasks involving trajectories such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. However, most methods target only one specific task and cannot be applied universally. Existing efforts to create a universal trajectory model often involve adding prediction modules for adapting to different tasks, while also struggle with incomplete or sparse trajectories. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM) designed to support different tasks based on incomplete or sparse trajectories without the need for retraining or extra prediction modules. To addresses task adaptability on incomplete trajectories, UVTM divide the spatio-temporal features of trajectories into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to suit the input and output needs of specific tasks. To handle sparse trajectories effectively, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing densely sampled trajectories from sparsely sampled ones, allowing it to extract detailed spatio-temporal information from sparse trajectories. Experiments involving three representative trajectory-related tasks on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the intended properties performance of UVTM and offer evidence that UVTM is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPTraj-PM: Differentially Private Trajectory Synthesis Using Prefix Tree and Markov Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14106v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of GPS-enabled devices has generated a large amount of trajectory data. These data offer us vital insights to understand the movements of individuals and populations, benefiting a broad range of applications from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, improper release of trajectory data is increasing concerns on individual privacy. Previous attempts either lack strong privacy guarantees, or fail to preserve sufficient basic characteristics of the original data. In this paper, we propose DPTraj-PM, a method to synthesize trajectory dataset under the differential privacy (DP) framework while ensures high data utility. Based on the assumption that an individual's trajectory could be mainly determined by the initial trajectory segment (which depicts the starting point and the initial direction) and the next location point, DPTraj-PM discretizes the raw trajectories into neighboring cells, and models them by combining a prefix tree structure and an m-order Markov process. After adding noise to the model under differential privacy, DPTraj-PM generates a synthetic dataset from the noisy model to enable a wider spectrum of data mining and modeling tasks. The output traces crafted by DPTraj-PM not only preserves the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors, but also protects individual privacy. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DPTraj-PM substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/wnn5/DP-PrefixTreeMarkov.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing studies typically ignore the confounding effects of geospatial context, leading to the acquisition of spurious correlations and limited generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we initially formulate a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to decipher the trajectory representation learning process from a causal perspective. Building upon the SCM, we further present a Trajectory modeling framework (TrajCL) based on Causal Learning, which leverages the backdoor adjustment theory as an intervention tool to eliminate the spurious correlations between geospatial context and trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify that TrajCL markedly enhances performance in trajectory classification tasks while showcasing superior generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> |  |

We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |

Current research predominantly focuses on traditional deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These methods leverage relative distances to forecast the motion trajectories of a single class of agents. However, in complex traffic scenarios, the motion patterns of various types of traffic participants exhibit inherent randomness and uncertainty. Relying solely on relative distances may not adequately capture the nuanced interaction patterns between different classes of road users. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class trajectory prediction method named the social force embedded mixed graph convolutional network (SFEM-GCN). SFEM-GCN comprises three graph topologies: the semantic graph (SG), position graph (PG), and velocity graph (VG). These graphs encode various of social force relationships among different classes of agents in complex scenes. Specifically, SG utilizes one-hot encoding of agent-class information to guide the construction of graph adjacency matrices based on semantic information. PG and VG create adjacency matrices to capture motion interaction relationships between different classes agents. These graph structures are then integrated into a mixed graph, where learning is conducted using a spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCNN). To further enhance prediction performance, we adopt temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to generate the predicted trajectory with fewer parameters. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that SFEM-GCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,3 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent vehicles</p></details> |

We propose a trajectory augmentation method designed to maintain similarity with expert trajectory data. To accomplish this, we first cluster trajectories to identify minority yet safety-critical groups. Then, we combine the trajectories within the same cluster through geometrical transformation to create new trajectories. These trajectories are then added to the training dataset, provided that they meet our specified safety-related criteria. Our experiments exhibit that training an imitation learning model using these augmented trajectories can significantly improve closed-loop performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2024</p></details> |

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 CVPR AICity Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Learning Distributions over Trajectories for Human Behavior Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05166v4)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future behavior of human road users is an important aspect for the development of risk-aware autonomous vehicles. While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory prediction models based on the neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous attack methods have achieved high attack success rates but overlook the adaptability to realistic scenarios and the concealment of the deceits. To address this problem, we propose a speed-adaptive stealthy adversarial attack method named SA-Attack. This method searches the sensitive region of trajectory prediction models and generates the adversarial trajectories by using the vehicle-following method and incorporating information about forthcoming trajectories. Our method has the ability to adapt to different speed scenarios by reconstructing the trajectory from scratch. Fusing future trajectory trends and curvature constraints can guarantee the smoothness of adversarial trajectories, further ensuring the stealthiness of attacks. The empirical study on the datasets of nuScenes and Apolloscape demonstrates the attack performance of our proposed method. Finally, we also demonstrate the adaptability and stealthiness of SA-Attack for different speed scenarios. Our code is available at the repository: https://github.com/eclipse-bot/SA-Attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE IV Symposium</p></details> |

The system utilizes information presently accessible to customers through smartphones and retail apps: motion data, store map, and purchase records. The approach eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers maintain full control of their data. Specifically, RetailOpt first employs inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are then cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through systematic experiments in five diverse environments. The proposed system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications, including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation. The potential application could also extend to other domains such as entertainment and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716v5)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrACT: A Training Dynamics Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Long-tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12538v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a safety critical task, autonomous driving requires accurate predictions of road users' future trajectories for safe motion planning, particularly under challenging conditions. Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[NLP-enabled trajectory map-matching in urban road networks using transformer sequence-to-sequence model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version and published in the "Early Access" area of IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles on 16 April 2024.

The motion planning of the proposed robot system presents challenges arising from the nonholonomic constraints of the trailer, system underactuation, and hybrid interaction through the cable. To tackle these challenges, we develop a hybrid dynamics model that accounts for the cable's taut/slack status. Since it is computationally intense to directly optimize the trajectory, we first propose a search algorithm to compute a sub-optimal trajectory as the initial solution. Then, a novel collision avoidance constraint based on the geometric shapes of objects is proposed to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for the hybrid system. The proposed trajectory planning method is implemented on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot with a customized cable-trailer and validated through experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Stay on Track: A Frenet Wrapper to Overcome Off-road Trajectories in Vehicle Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00605v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future motion of observed vehicles is a crucial enabler for safe autonomous driving. The field of motion prediction has seen large progress recently with state-of-the-Art (sotA) models achieving impressive results on large-scale public benchmarks. However, recent work revealed that learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be solved by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that leverages a Frenet representation of the scene, and that can be applied to SotA models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a comprehensive benchmark using two SotA motion prediction models. Our experiments show that this reduces the off-road rate on challenging scenarios by more than 90% without sacrificing average performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. Heuristic and explicit simple rules make trajectory lack generality and complex motion. One of the approaches to resolve the above limitations of traditional trajectory planning methods is trajectory planning using reinforcement learning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from instability of learning and prior works of trajectory planning using reinforcement learning didn't consider the uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles using reinforcement learning. The proposed method includes iterative reward prediction method that stabilizes the learning process, and uncertainty propagation method that makes the reinforcement learning agent to be aware of the uncertainties. The proposed method is experimented in the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline method, we have reduced the collision rate by 60.17%, and increased the average reward to 30.82 times.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S4TP) framework. Specifically, S4TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV's planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S4TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs'trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S4TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within lowrisk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S4TP in terms of safety and rationality. S4TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,4 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging. Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information. In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label. We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride. We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands. We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance. Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.

| **[A Comparative Study of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Algorithms Applied to Ship Trajectory Planning and Behavior Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01194v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms, notably used for nonholonomic vehicle navigation in complex environments, are often not thoroughly evaluated for their specific challenges. This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators. Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch`s t-test at a significance level of Alpha = 0.05, indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

Despite the recent advances in data-driven approaches, grasping remains an unsolved problem.

Novelty Search (NS) refers to evolutionary algorithms that replace selection of best performing individuals with selection of the most novel ones. Such methods have already shown promising results on hard exploration problems. In this work, we introduce a new NS-based method that can generate large datasets of grasping trajectories in a platform-agnostic manner. Inspired by the hierarchical learning paradigm, our method decouples approach and prehension to make the behavioral space smoother. Experiments conducted on 3 different robot-gripper setups and on several standard objects shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art for generating diverse repertoire of grasping trajectories, getting a higher successful run ratio, as well as a better diversity for both approach and prehension.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity.

In this paper, we propose a novel mixture hidden Markov model for subgrouping patient trajectories from chronic diseases. Our model is probabilistic and carefully designed to capture different trajectory phases of chronic diseases (i.e., "severe", "moderate", and "mild") through tailored latent states. We demonstrate our subgrouping framework based on a longitudinal study across 847 patients with non-specific low back pain. Here, our subgrouping framework identifies 8 subgroups. Further, we show that our subgrouping framework outperforms common baselines in terms of cluster validity indices. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the model to other chronic and long-lasting diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming at Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Offline Trajectory Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories. Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts. However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation. Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6-D Trajectories for Omnidirectional Multirotor Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10392v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As fully-actuated systems, omnidirectional multirotor aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have more flexible maneuverability and advantages in aggressive flight in cluttered environments than traditional underactuated MAVs. %Due to the high dimensionality of configuration space, making the designed trajectory generation algorithm efficient is challenging. This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Generic Trajectory Planning Method for Constrained All-Wheel-Steering Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09677v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a trajectory planning method for wheeled robots with fixed steering axes while the steering angle of each wheel is constrained. In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

However, we observed that LCM struggles to generate images with both clarity and detailed intricacy. Consequently, we introduce Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD), which encompasses trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling. The trajectory consistency function diminishes the parameterisation and distillation errors by broadening the scope of the self-consistency boundary condition with trajectory mapping and endowing the TCD with the ability to accurately trace the entire trajectory of the Probability Flow ODE in semi-linear form with an Exponential Integrator. Additionally, strategic stochastic sampling provides explicit control of stochastic and circumvents the accumulated errors inherent in multi-step consistency sampling. Experiments demonstrate that TCD not only significantly enhances image quality at low NFEs but also yields more detailed results compared to the teacher model at high NFEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mhh0318.github.io/tcd</p></details> |

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand.

| **[Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00658v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[WildGraph: Realistic Graph-based Trajectory Generation for Wildlife](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08068v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation is an important task in movement studies; it circumvents the privacy, ethical, and technical challenges of collecting real trajectories from the target population. In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics. Our code is published on the following repository: \url{https://github.com/aliwister/wildgraph}.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Performance of Jerk-Constrained Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Industrial Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07889v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jerk-constrained trajectories offer a wide range of advantages that collectively improve the performance of robotic systems, including increased energy efficiency, durability, and safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

| **[VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06351v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

| **[Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proves challenging in tasks featuring scant rewards. These limited rewards merely signify whether the task is partially or entirely accomplished, necessitating various exploration actions before the agent garners meaningful feedback. Consequently, the majority of existing DRL exploration algorithms struggle to acquire practical policies within a reasonable timeframe. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach leveraging offline demonstration trajectories for swifter and more efficient online RL in environments with sparse rewards. Our pivotal insight involves treating offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, rather than mere imitation, allowing our method to learn a policy whose distribution of state-action visitation marginally matches that of offline demonstrations. We specifically introduce a novel trajectory distance relying on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and cast policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. We then illustrate that this optimization problem can be streamlined into a policy-gradient algorithm, integrating rewards shaped by insights from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm undergoes evaluation across extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and misleading rewards. The experimental findings demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed algorithm over baseline methods concerning diverse exploration and the acquisition of an optimal policy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction with Region-based Relation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06971v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p></details> |  |

To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deadlock Resolution and Recursive Feasibility in MPC-based Multi-robot Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06071v4)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online collision-free trajectory generation within a shared workspace is fundamental for most multi-robot applications. However, many widely-used methods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on the feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a distributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where several robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as introducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to validate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method called infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The MPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered Voronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of deadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force equilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively detect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an adaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable deadlocks can exist under minor conditions. In addition, the proposed planning algorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each time step under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots and requires only local communication. Comprehensive simulation and experiment studies are conducted over large-scale multi-robot systems. Significant improvements on success rate are reported, in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and especially in crowded and high-speed scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Typically, this issue is addressed by providing low-level per-frame guidance in the form of edge maps, depth maps, or an existing video to be altered. However, the process of obtaining such guidance can be labor-intensive. This paper focuses on enhancing controllability in video synthesis by employing straightforward bounding boxes to guide the subject in various ways, all without the need for neural network training, finetuning, optimization at inference time, or the use of pre-existing videos. Our algorithm, TrailBlazer, is constructed upon a pre-trained (T2V) model, and easy to implement. The subject is directed by a bounding box through the proposed spatial and temporal attention map editing. Moreover, we introduce the concept of keyframing, allowing the subject trajectory and overall appearance to be guided by both a moving bounding box and corresponding prompts, without the need to provide a detailed mask. The method is efficient, with negligible additional computation relative to the underlying pre-trained model. Despite the simplicity of the bounding box guidance, the resulting motion is surprisingly natural, with emergent effects including perspective and movement toward the virtual camera as the box size increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://hohonu-vicml.github.io/Trailblazer.Page/</p></details> |
| **[Dynamical stability and chaos in artificial neural network trajectories along training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05782v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of training an artificial neural network involves iteratively adapting its parameters so as to minimize the error of the network's prediction, when confronted with a learning task. This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Design and Simulation of Time-energy Optimal Anti-swing Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Tower Cranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05581v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For autonomous crane lifting, optimal trajectories of the crane are required as reference inputs to the crane controller to facilitate feedforward control. Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW'24) as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments with Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

LfO can facilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and reducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a transformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and action pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation or inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While several existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity recognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However, SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single viewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the observed task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing occlusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and synchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present multi-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception of multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better recognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two distinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs under occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other baselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance under different ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecture components. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployable state-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI-2024 and 'Towards Reliable and Deployable Learning-Based Robotic Systems' Workshop at CoRL2023</p></details> |

In this regard, a common shortcoming of current benchmark datasets is their limitation to sets of sample trajectories and a lack of actual ground truth distributions, which prevents the use of more expressive error metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance for model evaluation. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic dataset generation based on composite probabilistic B\'ezier curves, which is capable of generating ground truth data in terms of probability distributions over full trajectories. This allows the calculation of arbitrary posterior distributions. The paper showcases an exemplary trajectory prediction model evaluation using generated ground truth distribution data.</p></details> |  |

The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS); 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Autonomous Driving Safety with POP: A Framework for Accurate Partially Observed Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15685v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for safe and efficient autonomous driving, but handling partial observations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. POP achieves comparable results to top-performing methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Kalman Filtering based on Self-Attention Mechanism and Lattice Trajectory Piecewise Linear Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03915v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional Kalman filter (KF) is widely applied in control systems, but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the system model and noise parameters, leading to potential performance degradation when facing inaccuracies. To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

In contrast to the prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior learned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case trajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent behavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial state, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse population of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT incorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global diversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments with policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous environments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results highlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior beyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

Such tasks are designed to assess whether novices have developed the analytical skills to translate from the given problem domain to coding. In the past researchers have used instruments such as code-explain and found that the extent of cognitive depth reached in these tasks correlated well with code writing ability. However, the need for manual marking and personalized interviews used for identifying cognitive difficulties limited the study to a small group of stragglers. To extend this work to larger groups, we have devised several question types with varying cognitive demands collectively called Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks (ARTs), which do not require manual marking. These tasks require levels of reasoning which can define a learning trajectory. This paper describes these instruments and the machine learning models used for validating them. We have used the data collected in an introductory programming course in the penultimate week of the semester which required attempting ART type instruments and code writing. Our preliminary research suggests ART type instruments can be combined with specific machine learning models to act as an effective learning trajectory and early prediction of code-writing skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj), setting a new benchmark for future research.

However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. We also test the traffic state estimation when traffic flow information is obtained from loop detectors. The results demonstrate the adaptability of our TSE method across different CV penetration rates and types of detectors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in scenarios with sparse observation rates.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their impressive performance, the fairness problem has increasingly gained attention as a crucial aspect to consider. Existing research in graph learning focuses on either group fairness or individual fairness. However, since each concept provides unique insights into fairness from distinct perspectives, integrating them into a fair graph neural network system is crucial. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet to comprehensively tackle both individual and group fairness simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new concept of individual fairness within groups and a novel framework named Fairness for Group and Individual (FairGI), which considers both group fairness and individual fairness within groups in the context of graph learning. FairGI employs the similarity matrix of individuals to achieve individual fairness within groups, while leveraging adversarial learning to address group fairness in terms of both Equal Opportunity and Statistical Parity. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of group fairness and individual fairness within groups, but also exhibits excellent performance in population-level individual fairness, while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing deep-learning-based methods for modeling network routing are not able to extrapolate towards unseen feature distributions. Nor are they able to handle scaled and drifted network attributes in test sets that include open-world inputs. To deal with these challenges, we propose a novel approach for modeling network routing, using Graph Neural Networks. Our method can also be used for network-latency estimation. Supported by a domain-knowledge-assisted graph formulation, our model shares a stable performance across different network sizes and configurations of routing networks, while at the same time being able to extrapolate towards unseen sizes, configurations, and user behavior. We show that our model outperforms most conventional deep-learning-based models, in terms of prediction accuracy, computational resources, inference speed, as well as ability to generalize towards open-world input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IJCNN 2022</p></details> |

Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible. Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based optimization.</p></details> |  |

These rules can be exploited to optimize the structure of ZX-diagrams for a range of applications. However, finding an optimal sequence of transformation rules is generally an open problem. In this work, we bring together ZX-diagrams with reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique designed to discover an optimal sequence of actions in a decision-making problem and show that a trained reinforcement learning agent can significantly outperform other optimization techniques like a greedy strategy or simulated annealing. The use of graph neural networks to encode the policy of the agent enables generalization to diagrams much bigger than seen during the training phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures - Revision on 26.04.2024: Fixed bug in training algorithm to give quantitatively better results (qualitative results unchanged)</p></details> |

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 20 figures submitted to CMAME (Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering)</p></details> |

While single-drug effects on cell lines are well-documented, the scarcity of data on drug synergy, considering the vast array of potential drug combinations, prompts a growing interest in computational approaches for predicting synergies in untested drug pairs. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (\textit{GNN}) based model for drug synergy prediction, which utilizes drug chemical structures and cell line gene expression data. We extract data from the largest available drug combination database (DrugComb) and generate multiple synergy scores (commonly used in the literature) to create seven datasets that serve as a reliable benchmark with high confidence. In contrast to conventional models relying on pre-computed chemical features, our GNN-based approach learns task-specific drug representations directly from the graph structure of the drugs, providing superior performance in predicting drug synergies. Our work suggests that learning task-specific drug representations and leveraging a diverse dataset is a promising approach to advancing our understanding of drug-drug interaction and synergy.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairGT: A Fairness-aware Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17169v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of Graph Transformers (GTs) generally neglects considerations for fairness, resulting in biased outcomes against certain sensitive subgroups. Since GTs encode graph information without relying on message-passing mechanisms, conventional fairness-aware graph learning methods cannot be directly applicable to address these issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose FairGT, a Fairness-aware Graph Transformer explicitly crafted to mitigate fairness concerns inherent in GTs. FairGT incorporates a meticulous structural feature selection strategy and a multi-hop node feature integration method, ensuring independence of sensitive features and bolstering fairness considerations. These fairness-aware graph information encodings seamlessly integrate into the Transformer framework for downstream tasks. We also prove that the proposed fair structural topology encoding with adjacency matrix eigenvector selection and multi-hop integration are theoretically effective. Empirical evaluations conducted across five real-world datasets demonstrate FairGT's superiority in fairness metrics over existing graph transformers, graph neural networks, and state-of-the-art fairness-aware graph learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPGAN: A Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network for Missing Data Imputation in Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17164v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data imputation poses a paramount challenge when dealing with graph data. Prior works typically are based on feature propagation or graph autoencoders to address this issue. However, these methods usually encounter the over-smoothing issue when dealing with missing data, as the graph neural network (GNN) modules are not explicitly designed for handling missing data. This paper proposes a novel framework, called Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network (DPGAN), that can deal simultaneously with missing data and avoid over-smoothing problems. The crux of our work is that it admits both global and local representations of the input graph signal, which can capture the long-range dependencies. It is realized via our proposed generator, consisting of two key components, i.e., MLPUNet++ and GraphUNet++. Our generator is trained with a designated discriminator via an adversarial process. In particular, to avoid assessing the entire graph as did in the literature, our discriminator focuses on the local subgraph fidelity, thereby boosting the quality of the local imputation. The subgraph size is adjustable, allowing for control over the intensity of adversarial regularization. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmark datasets substantiate that DPGAN consistently rivals, if not outperforms, existing state-of-the-art imputation algorithms.

To capture both structural and semantic information in HetGs, HGNNs first aggregate the neighboring feature vectors for each vertex in each semantic graph and then fuse the aggregated results across all semantic graphs for each vertex. Unfortunately, existing graph neural network accelerators are ill-suited to accelerate HGNNs. This is because they fail to efficiently tackle the specific execution patterns and exploit the high-degree parallelism as well as data reusability inside and across the processing of semantic graphs in HGNNs. In this work, we first quantitatively characterize a set of representative HGNN models on GPU to disclose the execution bound of each stage, inter-semantic-graph parallelism, and inter-semantic-graph data reusability in HGNNs. Guided by our findings, we propose a high-performance HGNN accelerator, HiHGNN, to alleviate the execution bound and exploit the newfound parallelism and data reusability in HGNNs. Specifically, we first propose a bound-aware stage-fusion methodology that tailors to HGNN acceleration, to fuse and pipeline the execution stages being aware of their execution bounds. Second, we design an independency-aware parallel execution design to exploit the inter-semantic-graph parallelism. Finally, we present a similarity-aware execution scheduling to exploit the inter-semantic-graph data reusability. Compared to the state-of-the-art software framework running on NVIDIA GPU T4 and GPU A100, HiHGNN respectively achieves an average 41.5$\times$ and 8.6$\times$ speedup as well as 106$\times$ and 73$\times$ energy efficiency with quarter the memory bandwidth of GPU A100.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 17 figures; To appear in IEEE TPDS 2024</p></details> |

Since the construction details are unknown for attackers in a black-box scenario, it is unrealistic to conduct the classical adversarial attacks that require a specific adjacency matrix. In this paper, we propose the first general black-box adversarial attack framework, i.e., General Attack via Fake Social Interaction (GAFSI), against detectors based on different graph structures. Specifically, as sharing is an important social interaction for GNN-based fake news detectors to construct the graph, we simulate sharing behaviors to fool the detectors. Firstly, we propose a fraudster selection module to select engaged users leveraging local and global information. In addition, a post injection module guides the selected users to create shared relations by sending posts. The sharing records will be added to the social context, leading to a general attack against different detectors. Experimental results on empirical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GAFSI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2024</p></details> |

Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND employs the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties of fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting. Experimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs.

Recent advancements utilize graph convolutional neural networks to extract features within graph structures. Despite promising results, these methods face challenges in real-world applications due to sparse features, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Recent studies draw inspiration from the mammalian brain and employ spiking neural networks to model and learn graph structures. However, these approaches are limited to traditional Von Neumann-based computing systems, which still face hardware inefficiencies. In this study, we present a fully neuromorphic implementation of spiking graph neural networks designed for Loihi 2. We optimize network parameters using Lava Bayesian Optimization, a novel hyperparameter optimization system compatible with neuromorphic computing architectures. We showcase the performance benefits of combining neuromorphic Bayesian optimization with our approach for citation graph classification using fixed-precision spiking neurons.

Despite their effectiveness, their adoption has not been pervasive because of scalability challenges associated with large-scale graph datasets, particularly when leveraging message passing. To tackle these challenges, we introduce NeuraChip, a novel GNN spatial accelerator based on Gustavson's algorithm. NeuraChip decouples the multiplication and addition computations in sparse matrix multiplication. This separation allows for independent exploitation of their unique data dependencies, facilitating efficient resource allocation. We introduce a rolling eviction strategy to mitigate data idling in on-chip memory as well as address the prevalent issue of memory bloat in sparse graph computations. Furthermore, the compute resource load balancing is achieved through a dynamic reseeding hash-based mapping, ensuring uniform utilization of computing resources agnostic of sparsity patterns. Finally, we present NeuraSim, an open-source, cycle-accurate, multi-threaded, modular simulator for comprehensive performance analysis. Overall, NeuraChip presents a significant improvement, yielding an average speedup of 22.1x over Intel's MKL, 17.1x over NVIDIA's cuSPARSE, 16.7x over AMD's hipSPARSE, and 1.5x over prior state-of-the-art SpGEMM accelerator and 1.3x over GNN accelerator.

Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.</p></details> |  |

To that end, we propose a method to extract global concept explanations from the predictions of graph neural networks to develop a deeper understanding of the tasks underlying structure-property relationships. We identify concept explanations as dense clusters in the self-explaining Megan models subgraph latent space. For each concept, we optimize a representative prototype graph and optionally use GPT-4 to provide hypotheses about why each structure has a certain effect on the prediction. We conduct computational experiments on synthetic and real-world graph property prediction tasks. For the synthetic tasks we find that our method correctly reproduces the structural rules by which they were created. For real-world molecular property regression and classification tasks, we find that our method rediscovers established rules of thumb. More specifically, our results for molecular mutagenicity prediction indicate more fine-grained resolution of structural details than existing explainability methods, consistent with previous results from chemistry literature. Overall, our results show promising capability to extract the underlying structure-property relationships for complex graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, accepted at xAI world conference 2024</p></details> |

The dataset comprises bone marrow samples from 30 patients, with each cell characterized by twelve markers. Ground truth labels identify five hematological cell types: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Monocytes, Mast cells, and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs). Experiments utilize supervised inductive learning and semi-supervised transductive learning on up to 1 million cells per patient. Baseline methods include Gaussian Mixture Models, XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs demonstrate superior performance by exploiting spatial relationships in graph-encoded data. The benchmark allows standardized evaluation of clinically relevant classification tasks, along with exploratory analyses to gain insights into hematological cell phenotypes. This represents the first public flow cytometry benchmark with a richly annotated, heterogeneous dataset.

Existing defense methods suffer from severe performance decline under unseen attacks, due to either limited observed adversarial examples or pre-defined heuristics. To address these limitations, we analyze the causalities in graph adversarial attacks and conclude that causal features are key to achieve graph adversarial robustness, owing to their determinedness for labels and invariance across attacks. To learn these causal features, we innovatively propose an Invariant causal DEfense method against adversarial Attacks (IDEA). We derive node-based and structure-based invariance objectives from an information-theoretic perspective. IDEA ensures strong predictability for labels and invariant predictability across attacks, which is provably a causally invariant defense across various attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDEA attains state-of-the-art defense performance under all five attacks on all five datasets.

Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from solely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G3AD can outperform seventeen state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Coverage-based fault localization, a widely used technique, employs statistics on coverage spectra to rank code based on suspiciousness scores. However, the rigidity of statistical approaches calls for learning-based techniques. Amongst all, Grace, a graph-neural network (GNN) based technique has achieved state-of-the-art due to its capacity to preserve coverage spectra, i.e., test-to-source coverage relationships, as precise abstract syntax-enhanced graph representation, mitigating the limitation of other learning-based technique which compresses the feature representation. However, such representation struggles with scalability due to the increasing complexity of software and associated coverage spectra and AST graphs. In this work, we proposed a new graph representation, DepGraph, that reduces the complexity of the graph representation by 70% in nodes and edges by integrating interprocedural call graph in the graph representation of the code. Moreover, we integrate additional features such as code change information in the graph as attributes so the model can leverage rich historical project data. We evaluate DepGraph using Defects4j 2.0.0, and it outperforms Grace by locating 20% more faults in Top-1 and improving the Mean First Rank (MFR) and the Mean Average Rank (MAR) by over 50% while decreasing GPU memory usage by 44% and training/inference time by 85%. Additionally, in cross-project settings, DepGraph surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline with a 42% higher Top-1 accuracy, and 68% and 65% improvement in MFR and MAR, respectively. Our study demonstrates DepGraph's robustness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability for future extension and adoption.</p></details> |  |

We present several error metrics that gauge the model's ability to predict the failure size, the final grid state, and the failure time steps of each branch within the cascade. We benchmark the graph neural network model against influence models.

However, the self-attention mechanism in GTs overlooks the graph's inductive biases, particularly biases related to structure, which are crucial for the graph tasks. Although some methods utilize positional encoding and attention bias to model inductive biases, their effectiveness is still suboptimal analytically. Therefore, this paper presents Gradformer, a method innovatively integrating GT with the intrinsic inductive bias by applying an exponential decay mask to the attention matrix. Specifically, the values in the decay mask matrix diminish exponentially, correlating with the decreasing node proximities within the graph structure. This design enables Gradformer to retain its ability to capture information from distant nodes while focusing on the graph's local details. Furthermore, Gradformer introduces a learnable constraint into the decay mask, allowing different attention heads to learn distinct decay masks. Such an design diversifies the attention heads, enabling a more effective assimilation of diverse structural information within the graph. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Gradformer consistently outperforms the Graph Neural Network and GT baseline models in various graph classification and regression tasks. Additionally, Gradformer has proven to be an effective method for training deep GT models, maintaining or even enhancing accuracy compared to shallow models as the network deepens, in contrast to the significant accuracy drop observed in other GT models.Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/LiuChuang0059/Gradformer}.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Bridging the Semantic-Numerical Gap: A Numerical Reasoning Method of Cross-modal Knowledge Graph for Material Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09744v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using machine learning (ML) techniques to predict material properties is a crucial research topic. These properties depend on numerical data and semantic factors. Due to the limitations of small-sample datasets, existing methods typically adopt ML algorithms to regress numerical properties or transfer other pre-trained knowledge graphs (KGs) to the material. However, these methods cannot simultaneously handle semantic and numerical information. In this paper, we propose a numerical reasoning method for material KGs (NR-KG), which constructs a cross-modal KG using semantic nodes and numerical proxy nodes. It captures both types of information by projecting KG into a canonical KG and utilizes a graph neural network to predict material properties. In this process, a novel projection prediction loss is proposed to extract semantic features from numerical information. NR-KG facilitates end-to-end processing of cross-modal data, mining relationships and cross-modal information in small-sample datasets, and fully utilizes valuable experimental data to enhance material prediction. We further propose two new High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) property datasets with semantic descriptions. NR-KG outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving relative improvements of 25.9% and 16.1% on two material datasets. Besides, NR-KG surpasses SOTA methods on two public physical chemistry molecular datasets, showing improvements of 22.2% and 54.3%, highlighting its potential application and generalizability. We hope the proposed datasets, algorithms, and pre-trained models can facilitate the communities of KG and AI for materials.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent code embedding approach for vulnerability detection, owing to their ability to capture the underlying semantic structure of source code. However, GNNs face significant challenges in explainability due to their inherently black-box nature. To this end, several factual reasoning-based explainers have been proposed. These explainers provide explanations for the predictions made by GNNs by analyzing the key features that contribute to the outcomes. We argue that these factual reasoning-based explanations cannot answer critical what-if questions: What would happen to the GNN's decision if we were to alter the code graph into alternative structures? Inspired by advancements of counterfactual reasoning in artificial intelligence, we propose CFExplainer, a novel counterfactual explainer for GNN-based vulnerability detection. Unlike factual reasoning-based explainers, CFExplainer seeks the minimal perturbation to the input code graph that leads to a change in the prediction, thereby addressing the what-if questions for vulnerability detection. We term this perturbation a counterfactual explanation, which can pinpoint the root causes of the detected vulnerability and furnish valuable insights for developers to undertake appropriate actions for fixing the vulnerability. Extensive experiments on four GNN-based vulnerability detection models demonstrate the effectiveness of CFExplainer over existing state-of-the-art factual reasoning-based explainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted in the proceedings of the 33nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2024)</p></details> |

However, training and assessing numerous architectures introduces considerable computational overhead. One method to mitigating this is through performance predictors, which offer a means to estimate the potential of an architecture without exhaustive training. Given that neural architectures fundamentally resemble Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become an apparent choice for such predictive tasks. Nevertheless, the scarcity of training data can impact the precision of GNN-based predictors. To address this, we introduce a novel GNN predictor for NAS. This predictor renders neural architectures into vector representations by combining both the conventional and inverse graph views. Additionally, we incorporate a customized training loss within the GNN predictor to ensure efficient utilization of both types of representations. We subsequently assessed our method through experiments on benchmark datasets including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and the DARTS search space, with a training dataset ranging from 50 to 400 samples. Benchmarked against leading GNN predictors, the experimental results showcase a significant improvement in prediction accuracy, with a 3%--16% increase in Kendall-tau correlation.

Capturing contextual information from textual data for event forecasting poses significant challenges due to the intricate structure of the documents and the evolving nature of events. Recently, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of input text graphs. However, these models only utilize node-level representation, causing the loss of the global information from graph-level representation. On the other hand, both node-level and graph-level representations are essential for effective event prediction as node-level representation gives insight into the local structure, and the graph-level representation provides an understanding of the global structure of the temporal graph. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL employs a local view encoder to learn the evolving node representations, which effectively captures the local dynamic structure of input graphs. Additionally, it harnesses a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Then we update the graph representations from both encoders using contrastive learning. In the final stage, DyGCL combines both representations using an attention mechanism and optimizes its capability to predict future events. Our extensive experiment demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods for event prediction on six real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, beam training for mmWave ELAA systems is challenged by excessive pilot overheads as well as insufficient accuracy, as the huge near-field codebook has to be accounted for. In this paper, inspired by the similarity between far-field sub-6 GHz channels and near-field mmWave channels, we propose to leverage sub-6 GHz uplink pilot signals to directly estimate the optimal near-field mmWave codeword, which aims to reduce pilot overhead and bypass the channel estimation. Moreover, we adopt deep learning to perform this dual mapping function, i.e., sub-6 GHz to mmWave, far-field to near-field, and a novel neural network structure called NMBEnet is designed to enhance the precision of beam training. Specifically, when considering the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication scenarios with high user density, correlations arise both between signals from different users and between signals from different subcarriers. Accordingly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) module and graph neural network (GNN) module included in the proposed NMBEnet can leverage these two correlations to further enhance the precision of beam training.</p></details> |  |

We employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method that helps analyze the topological information of graphs, to explain the reasons for the high performance. We propose a novel method that employs PH for LP (PHLP) focusing on how the presence or absence of target links influences the overall topology. The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, PHLP is the first method of applying PH to LP without GNNs. The proposed approach, employing PH while not relying on neural networks, enables the identification of crucial factors for improving performance.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, extensive research has shown their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which involve subtle perturbations to the inputs of the models aimed at compromising their performance. Recent proposals have effectively leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to produce predictions based also on the structural patterns exhibited by intrusions to enhance the detection robustness. However, the adoption of GNN-based NIDS introduces new types of risks. In this paper, we propose the first formalization of adversarial attacks specifically tailored for GNN in network intrusion detection. Moreover, we outline and model the problem space constraints that attackers need to consider to carry out feasible structural attacks in real-world scenarios. As a final contribution, we conduct an extensive experimental campaign in which we launch the proposed attacks against state-of-the-art GNN-based NIDS. Our findings demonstrate the increased robustness of the models against classical feature-based adversarial attacks, while highlighting their susceptibility to structure-based attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint submitted to IEEE TIFS, under review</p></details> |
| **[Formal Verification of Graph Convolutional Networks with Uncertain Node Features and Uncertain Graph Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15065v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs. They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes. We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Delayed Bottlenecking: Alleviating Forgetting in Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14941v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training GNNs to extract transferable knowledge and apply it to downstream tasks has become the de facto standard of graph representation learning. Recent works focused on designing self-supervised pre-training tasks to extract useful and universal transferable knowledge from large-scale unlabeled data. However, they have to face an inevitable question: traditional pre-training strategies that aim at extracting useful information about pre-training tasks, may not extract all useful information about the downstream task. In this paper, we reexamine the pre-training process within traditional pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks from the perspective of Information Bottleneck (IB) and confirm that the forgetting phenomenon in pre-training phase may cause detrimental effects on downstream tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel \underline{D}elayed \underline{B}ottlenecking \underline{P}re-training (DBP) framework which maintains as much as possible mutual information between latent representations and training data during pre-training phase by suppressing the compression operation and delays the compression operation to fine-tuning phase to make sure the compression can be guided with labeled fine-tuning data and downstream tasks. To achieve this, we design two information control objectives that can be directly optimized and further integrate them into the actual model design. Extensive experiments on both chemistry and biology domains demonstrate the effectiveness of DBP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Machine Learning in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14928v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs play an important role in representing complex relationships in various domains like social networks, knowledge graphs, and molecular discovery. With the advent of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), facilitating the representation and processing of graph structures. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in language tasks and are widely adopted in a variety of applications such as computer vision and recommender systems. This remarkable success has also attracted interest in applying LLMs to the graph domain. Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML's generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference. Furthermore, we investigate various applications and discuss the potential future directions in this promising field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CNN2GNN: How to Bridge CNN with GNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14822v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved excellent performance in vision tasks by extracting the intra-sample representation, it will take a higher training expense because of stacking numerous convolutional layers. Recently, as the bilinear models, graph neural networks (GNN) have succeeded in exploring the underlying topological relationship among the graph data with a few graph neural layers. Unfortunately, it cannot be directly utilized on non-graph data due to the lack of graph structure and has high inference latency on large-scale scenarios. Inspired by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, \textit{we discuss a natural question, how to bridge these two heterogeneous networks?} In this paper, we propose a novel CNN2GNN framework to unify CNN and GNN together via distillation. Firstly, to break the limitations of GNN, a differentiable sparse graph learning module is designed as the head of networks to dynamically learn the graph for inductive learning. Then, a response-based distillation is introduced to transfer the knowledge from CNN to GNN and bridge these two heterogeneous networks. Notably, due to extracting the intra-sample representation of a single instance and the topological relationship among the datasets simultaneously, the performance of distilled ``boosted'' two-layer GNN on Mini-ImageNet is much higher than CNN containing dozens of layers such as ResNet152.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Code Vulnerability Detection: Combining Code Language Models and Code Property Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14719v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, deep learning successfully applies to code vulnerability detection by learning from code sequences or property graphs. However, sequence-based methods often overlook essential code attributes such as syntax, control flow, and data dependencies, whereas graph-based approaches might underestimate the semantics of code and face challenges in capturing long-distance contextual information. To address this gap, we propose Vul-LMGNN, a unified model that combines pre-trained code language models with code property graphs for code vulnerability detection. Vul-LMGNN constructs a code property graph that integrates various code attributes (including syntax, flow control, and data dependencies) into a unified graph structure, thereafter leveraging pre-trained code model to extract local semantic features as node embeddings in the code property graph. Furthermore, to effectively retain dependency information among various attributes, we introduce a gated code Graph Neural Network (GNN). By jointly training the code language model and the gated code GNN modules in Vul-LMGNN, our proposed method efficiently leverages the strengths of both mechanisms. Finally, we utilize a pre-trained CodeBERT as an auxiliary classifier, with the final detection results derived by learning the linear interpolation of Vul-LMGNN and CodeBERT. The proposed method, evaluated across four real-world vulnerability datasets, demonstrated superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art approaches. Our source code could be accessed via the link: https://github.com/Vul-LMGNN/vul-LMGGNN.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community search (CS) aims to identify a set of nodes based on a specified query, leveraging structural cohesiveness and attribute homogeneity. This task enjoys various applications, ranging from fraud detection to recommender systems. In contrast to algorithm-based approaches, graph neural network (GNN) based methods define communities using ground truth labels, leveraging prior knowledge to explore patterns from graph structures and node features. However, existing solutions face three major limitations: 1) GNN-based models primarily focus on the disjoint community structure, disregarding the nature of nodes belonging to multiple communities. 2) These model structures suffer from low-order awareness and severe efficiency issues. 3) The identified community is subject to the free-rider and boundary effects. In this paper, we propose Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), which consist of three designs. First, we introduce a subspace community embedding technique called Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF). SSF enables the projection of community embeddings into distinct vector subspaces, accommodating the nature of overlapping and nesting community structures. In addition, we propose a lightweight model structure and a hop-wise attention mechanism to capture high-order patterns while improving model efficiency. Furthermore, two search algorithms are developed to minimize the latent space's community radius, addressing the challenges of free-rider and boundary effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. SMN achieves 14.73% improvements in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency.</p></details> |  |

These models necessitate effective uncertainty quantification to ensure reliable decision-making amid the challenges posed by model training discrepancies and unpredictable testing scenarios. This survey examines recent works that address uncertainty quantification within the model architectures, training, and inference of GNNs and PGMs. We aim to provide an overview of the current landscape of uncertainty in graphical models by organizing the recent methods into uncertainty representation and handling. By summarizing state-of-the-art methods, this survey seeks to deepen the understanding of uncertainty quantification in graphical models, thereby increasing their effectiveness and safety in critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Graph Neural Networks with HL-HGAT: A Hodge-Laplacian and Attention Mechanism Approach for Heterogeneous Graph-Structured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06687v2)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven effective in capturing relationships among nodes in a graph. This study introduces a novel perspective by considering a graph as a simplicial complex, encompassing nodes, edges, triangles, and $k$-simplices, enabling the definition of graph-structured data on any $k$-simplices. Our contribution is the Hodge-Laplacian heterogeneous graph attention network (HL-HGAT), designed to learn heterogeneous signal representations across $k$-simplices. The HL-HGAT incorporates three key components: HL convolutional filters (HL-filters), simplicial projection (SP), and simplicial attention pooling (SAP) operators, applied to $k$-simplices. HL-filters leverage the unique topology of $k$-simplices encoded by the Hodge-Laplacian (HL) operator, operating within the spectral domain of the $k$-th HL operator. To address computation challenges, we introduce a polynomial approximation for HL-filters, exhibiting spatial localization properties. Additionally, we propose a pooling operator to coarsen $k$-simplices, combining features through simplicial attention mechanisms of self-attention and cross-attention via transformers and SP operators, capturing topological interconnections across multiple dimensions of simplices. The HL-HGAT is comprehensively evaluated across diverse graph applications, including NP-hard problems, graph multi-label and classification challenges, and graph regression tasks in logistics, computer vision, biology, chemistry, and neuroscience. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy and versatility in handling a wide range of graph-based scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Graph Neural Networks to Predict Local Culture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17905v3)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

We analyse itsstability leveraging contraction analysis and propose a closed-form model that preserves the model contraction rate and doesnot require solving an ODE at each iteration. Compared todiscrete models like Graph Gated Neural Networks (GGNNs),the higher expressivity of the proposed model guaranteesremarkable performance while reducing the large amountof communicated variables normally required by GNNs. Weevaluate our model on a distributed multi-agent control casestudy (flocking) taking into account variable communicationrange and scalability under non-instantaneous communication</p></details> |  |
| **[Operational risk quantification of power grids using graph neural network surrogates of the DC OPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03661v2)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A DC OPF surrogate modeling framework is developed for Monte Carlo (MC) sampling-based risk quantification in power grid operation. MC simulation necessitates solving a large number of DC OPF problems corresponding to the samples of stochastic grid variables (power demand and renewable generation), which is computationally prohibitive. Computationally inexpensive surrogates of OPF provide an attractive alternative for expedited MC simulation. Graph neural network (GNN) surrogates of DC OPF, which are especially suitable to graph-structured data, are employed in this work. Previously developed DC OPF surrogate models have focused on accurate operational decision-making and not on risk quantification. Here, risk quantification-specific aspects of DC OPF surrogate evaluation is the main focus. To this end, the proposed GNN surrogates are evaluated using realistic joint probability distributions, quantification of their risk estimation accuracy, and investigation of their generalizability. Four synthetic grids (Case118, Case300, Case1354pegase, and Case2848rte) are used for surrogate model performance evaluation. It is shown that the GNN surrogates are sufficiently accurate for predicting the (bus-level, branch-level and system-level) grid state and enable fast as well as accurate operational risk quantification for power grids. The article thus develops tools for fast reliability and risk quantification in real-world power grids using GNN-based surrogates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modelingpapers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPGNN: Recognizing Salient Subgraph Patterns via Enhanced Graph Convolution and Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13655v1)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of machine learning on non-Euclidean data such as graphs and networks. GNNs effectively implement node representation learning through neighborhood aggregation and achieve impressive results in many graph-related tasks. However, most neighborhood aggregation approaches are summation-based, which can be problematic as they may not be sufficiently expressive to encode informative graph structures. Furthermore, though the graph pooling module is also of vital importance for graph learning, especially for the task of graph classification, research on graph down-sampling mechanisms is rather limited. To address the above challenges, we propose a concatenation-based graph convolution mechanism that injectively updates node representations to maximize the discriminative power in distinguishing non-isomorphic subgraphs. In addition, we design a novel graph pooling module, called WL-SortPool, to learn important subgraph patterns in a deep-learning manner. WL-SortPool layer-wise sorts node representations (i.e. continuous WL colors) to separately learn the relative importance of subtrees with different depths for the purpose of classification, thus better characterizing the complex graph topology and rich information encoded in the graph. We propose a novel Subgraph Pattern GNN (SPGNN) architecture that incorporates these enhancements. We test the proposed SPGNN architecture on many graph classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method can achieve highly competitive results with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other GNN approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Social Bot Detection via Structural Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13595v1)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on social bot detection plays a crucial role in maintaining the order and reliability of information dissemination while increasing trust in social interactions. The current mainstream social bot detection models rely on black-box neural network technology, e.g., Graph Neural Network, Transformer, etc., which lacks interpretability. In this work, we present UnDBot, a novel unsupervised, interpretable, yet effective and practical framework for detecting social bots. This framework is built upon structural information theory. We begin by designing three social relationship metrics that capture various aspects of social bot behaviors: Posting Type Distribution, Posting Influence, and Follow-to-follower Ratio. Three new relationships are utilized to construct a new, unified, and weighted social multi-relational graph, aiming to model the relevance of social user behaviors and discover long-distance correlations between users. Second, we introduce a novel method for optimizing heterogeneous structural entropy. This method involves the personalized aggregation of edge information from the social multi-relational graph to generate a two-dimensional encoding tree. The heterogeneous structural entropy facilitates decoding of the substantial structure of the social bots network and enables hierarchical clustering of social bots. Thirdly, a new community labeling method is presented to distinguish social bot communities by computing the user's stationary distribution, measuring user contributions to network structure, and counting the intensity of user aggregation within the community. Compared with ten representative social bot detection approaches, comprehensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of effectiveness and interpretability of UnDBot on four real social network datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Transactions on Information Systems</p></details> |

However, the distribution shift between the training and test data challenges the effectiveness of GNNs. To mitigate this challenge, Test-Time Training (TTT) has been proposed as a promising approach. Traditional TTT methods require a demanding unsupervised training strategy to capture the information from test to benefit the main task. Inspired by the great annotation ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), we propose to enhance the test-time training on graphs with LLMs as annotators. In this paper, we design a novel Test-Time Training pipeline, LLMTTT, which conducts the test-time adaptation under the annotations by LLMs on a carefully-selected node set. Specifically, LLMTTT introduces a hybrid active node selection strategy that considers not only node diversity and representativeness, but also prediction signals from the pre-trained model. Given annotations from LLMs, a two-stage training strategy is designed to tailor the test-time model with the limited and noisy labels. A theoretical analysis ensures the validity of our method and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLMTTT can achieve a significant performance improvement compared to existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization methods.</p></details> |  |

They do not encapsulate both semantic and visuo-spatial relationships among elements. To seize machine learning's potential for GUIs more efficiently, Graph4GUI exploits graph neural networks to capture individual elements' properties and their semantic-visuo-spatial constraints in a layout. The learned representation demonstrated its effectiveness in multiple tasks, especially generating designs in a challenging GUI autocompletion task, which involved predicting the positions of remaining unplaced elements in a partially completed GUI. The new model's suggestions showed alignment and visual appeal superior to the baseline method and received higher subjective ratings for preference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical benefits and efficiency advantages designers perceive when utilizing our model as an autocompletion plug-in.</p></details> | 18 pages |

It is mainly caused by the exponential growth of node dependency with the increase of layers. It extremely limits the application of stochastic optimization algorithms so that the training of GNN is usually time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose to decouple a multi-layer GNN as multiple simple modules for more efficient training, which is comprised of classical forward training (FT)and designed backward training (BT). Under the proposed framework, each module can be trained efficiently in FT by stochastic algorithms without distortion of graph information owing to its simplicity. To avoid the only unidirectional information delivery of FT and sufficiently train shallow modules with the deeper ones, we develop a backward training mechanism that makes the former modules perceive the latter modules. The backward training introduces the reversed information delivery into the decoupled modules as well as the forward information delivery. To investigate how the decoupling and greedy training affect the representational capacity, we theoretically prove that the error produced by linear modules will not accumulate on unsupervised tasks in most cases. The theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed framework is highly efficient with reasonable performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

| **[Hierarchical Representation Learning in Graph Neural Networks with Node Decimation Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11436v3)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In graph neural networks (GNNs), pooling operators compute local summaries of input graphs to capture their global properties, and they are fundamental for building deep GNNs that learn hierarchical representations. In this work, we propose the Node Decimation Pooling (NDP), a pooling operator for GNNs that generates coarser graphs while preserving the overall graph topology. During training, the GNN learns new node representations and fits them to a pyramid of coarsened graphs, which is computed offline in a pre-processing stage. NDP consists of three steps. First, a node decimation procedure selects the nodes belonging to one side of the partition identified by a spectral algorithm that approximates the \maxcut{} solution. Afterwards, the selected nodes are connected with Kron reduction to form the coarsened graph. Finally, since the resulting graph is very dense, we apply a sparsification procedure that prunes the adjacency matrix of the coarsened graph to reduce the computational cost in the GNN. Notably, we show that it is possible to remove many edges without significantly altering the graph structure. Experimental results show that NDP is more efficient compared to state-of-the-art graph pooling operators while reaching, at the same time, competitive performance on a significant variety of graph classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread adoption, the incorporation of off-the-shelf normalization layers like BatchNorm or InstanceNorm within a GNN architecture may not effectively capture the unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially reducing the expressive power of the overall architecture. Moreover, existing graph-specific normalization layers often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits. In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its neighborhood structure, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We present theoretical results that support our design choices. Our extensive empirical evaluation of various graph benchmarks underscores the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques. Furthermore, GRANOLA emerges as the top-performing method among all baselines within the same time complexity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs).</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods formulate the task as a multi-classification problem, i.e. assigning predefined labels to proteins. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Prot2Text, which predicts a protein's function in a free text style, moving beyond the conventional binary or categorical classifications. By combining Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) and Large Language Models(LLMs), in an encoder-decoder framework, our model effectively integrates diverse data types including protein sequence, structure, and textual annotation and description. This multimodal approach allows for a holistic representation of proteins' functions, enabling the generation of detailed and accurate functional descriptions. To evaluate our model, we extracted a multimodal protein dataset from SwissProt, and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of Prot2Text. These results highlight the transformative impact of multimodal models, specifically the fusion of GNNs and LLMs, empowering researchers with powerful tools for more accurate function prediction of existing as well as first-to-see proteins.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time, the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional computational overhead.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[High-Frequency-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding for Representation Learning on Text-attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16240v2)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate node representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where nodes are associated with text information. Although recent studies on graph neural networks (GNNs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) have exhibited their power in encoding network and text signals, respectively, less attention has been paid to delicately coupling these two types of models on TAGs. Specifically, existing GNNs rarely model text in each node in a contextualized way; existing PLMs can hardly be applied to characterize graph structures due to their sequence architecture. To address these challenges, we propose HASH-CODE, a High-frequency Aware Spectral Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding method that integrates GNNs and PLMs into a unified model. Different from previous "cascaded architectures" that directly add GNN layers upon a PLM, our HASH-CODE relies on five self-supervised optimization objectives to facilitate thorough mutual enhancement between network and text signals in diverse granularities. Moreover, we show that existing contrastive objective learns the low-frequency component of the augmentation graph and propose a high-frequency component (HFC)-aware contrastive learning objective that makes the learned embeddings more distinctive. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach. In addition, theoretical analysis and item embedding visualization provide insights into our model interoperability.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2024 |

Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency. Results: This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods. Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\% (top-5) and 5.4\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Matrix-Based Sampling for Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02909v3)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compact and computationally efficient way to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. GNN models are frequently large, making distributed minibatch training necessary. The primary contribution of this paper is new methods for reducing communication in the sampling step for distributed GNN training. Here, we propose a matrix-based bulk sampling approach that expresses sampling as a sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) and samples multiple minibatches at once. When the input graph topology does not fit on a single device, our method distributes the graph and use communication-avoiding SpGEMM algorithms to scale GNN minibatch sampling, enabling GNN training on much larger graphs than those that can fit into a single device memory. When the input graph topology (but not the embeddings) fits in the memory of one GPU, our approach (1) performs sampling without communication, (2) amortizes the overheads of sampling a minibatch, and (3) can represent multiple sampling algorithms by simply using different matrix constructions. In addition to new methods for sampling, we introduce a pipeline that uses our matrix-based bulk sampling approach to provide end-to-end training results. We provide experimental results on the largest Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets on $128$ GPUs, and show that our pipeline is $2.5\times$ faster than Quiver (a distributed extension to PyTorch-Geometric) on a $3$-layer GraphSAGE network. On datasets outside of OGB, we show a $8.46\times$ speedup on $128$ GPUs in per-epoch time. Finally, we show scaling when the graph is distributed across GPUs and scaling for both node-wise and layer-wise sampling algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of Machine Learning and Systems</p></details> |

Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in PSRO to improve scalability in solving large-scale PEGs. However, these methods primarily focus on specific PEGs with fixed initial conditions that may vary substantially in real-world scenarios, which significantly hinders the applicability of the traditional methods. To address this issue, we introduce Grasper, a GeneRAlist purSuer for Pursuit-Evasion pRoblems, capable of efficiently generating pursuer policies tailored to specific PEGs. Our contributions are threefold: First, we present a novel architecture that offers high-quality solutions for diverse PEGs, comprising critical components such as (i) a graph neural network (GNN) to encode PEGs into hidden vectors, and (ii) a hypernetwork to generate pursuer policies based on these hidden vectors. As a second contribution, we develop an efficient three-stage training method involving (i) a pre-pretraining stage for learning robust PEG representations through self-supervised graph learning techniques like GraphMAE, (ii) a pre-training stage utilizing heuristic-guided multi-task pre-training (HMP) where heuristic-derived reference policies (e.g., through Dijkstra's algorithm) regularize pursuer policies, and (iii) a fine-tuning stage that employs PSRO to generate pursuer policies on designated PEGs. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world maps, showcasing Grasper's significant superiority over baselines in terms of solution quality and generalizability. We demonstrate that Grasper provides a versatile approach for solving pursuit-evasion problems across a broad range of scenarios, enabling practical deployment in real-world situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Infinite-Horizon Graph Filters: Leveraging Power Series to Enhance Sparse Information Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09943v3)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown considerable effectiveness in a variety of graph learning tasks, particularly those based on the message-passing approach in recent years. However, their performance is often constrained by a limited receptive field, a challenge that becomes more acute in the presence of sparse graphs. In light of the power series, which possesses infinite expansion capabilities, we propose a novel Graph Power Filter Neural Network (GPFN) that enhances node classification by employing a power series graph filter to augment the receptive field. Concretely, our GPFN designs a new way to build a graph filter with an infinite receptive field based on the convergence power series, which can be analyzed in the spectral and spatial domains. Besides, we theoretically prove that our GPFN is a general framework that can integrate any power series and capture long-range dependencies. Finally, experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GPFN over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[Multi-View Subgraph Neural Networks: Self-Supervised Learning with Scarce Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12569v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks. Experimental results show that Muse outperforms the alternative methods on node classification tasks with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

However, most GNN architectures aggregate information from all nodes and edges in a graph, regardless of their relevance to the task at hand, thus hindering the interpretability of their predictions. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose a GNN \emph{training} approach that jointly i) finds the most predictive subgraph by removing edges and/or nodes -- -\emph{without making assumptions about the subgraph structure} -- while ii) optimizing the performance of the graph classification task. To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier. Our empirical results on nine different graph classification datasets show that our method competes in performance with baselines while relying on significantly sparser subgraphs, leading to more interpretable GNN-based predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Edits for Counterfactual Explanations: A comparative study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11609v3)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactuals have been established as a popular explainability technique which leverages a set of minimal edits to alter the prediction of a classifier. When considering conceptual counterfactuals on images, the edits requested should correspond to salient concepts present in the input data. At the same time, conceptual distances are defined by knowledge graphs, ensuring the optimality of conceptual edits. In this work, we extend previous endeavors on graph edits as counterfactual explanations by conducting a comparative study which encompasses both supervised and unsupervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches. To this end, we pose the following significant research question: should we represent input data as graphs, which is the optimal GNN approach in terms of performance and time efficiency to generate minimal and meaningful counterfactual explanations for black-box image classifiers?</p></details> |  |
| **[Label Inference Attacks against Node-level Vertical Federated GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02465v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models by keeping the raw data of the involved workers private. Three of its main objectives are to improve the models' privacy, security, and scalability. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers an efficient cross-silo setting where a few parties collaboratively train a model without sharing the same features. In such a scenario, classification labels are commonly considered sensitive information held exclusively by one (active) party, while other (passive) parties use only their local information. Recent works have uncovered important flaws of VFL, leading to possible label inference attacks under the assumption that the attacker has some, even limited, background knowledge on the relation between labels and data. In this work, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to investigate label inference attacks on VFL using a zero-background knowledge strategy. To formulate our proposal, we focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a target model for the underlying VFL. In particular, we refer to node classification tasks, which are widely studied, and GNNs have shown promising results. Our proposed attack, BlindSage, provides impressive results in the experiments, achieving nearly 100% accuracy in most cases. Even when the attacker has no information about the used architecture or the number of classes, the accuracy remains above 90% in most instances. Finally, we observe that well-known defenses cannot mitigate our attack without affecting the model's performance on the main classification task.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Mesh Optimization of a Hybrid Deep Learning Black-Box PDE Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11766v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in computational fluid dynamics. Recent research proposed a PDE correction framework that leverages deep learning to correct the solution obtained by a PDE solver on a coarse mesh. However, end-to-end training of such a PDE correction model over both solver-dependent parameters such as mesh parameters and neural network parameters requires the PDE solver to support automatic differentiation through the iterative numerical process. Such a feature is not readily available in many existing solvers. In this study, we explore the feasibility of end-to-end training of a hybrid model with a black-box PDE solver and a deep learning model for fluid flow prediction. Specifically, we investigate a hybrid model that integrates a black-box PDE solver into a differentiable deep graph neural network. To train this model, we use a zeroth-order gradient estimator to differentiate the PDE solver via forward propagation. Although experiments show that the proposed approach based on zeroth-order gradient estimation underperforms the baseline that computes exact derivatives using automatic differentiation, our proposed method outperforms the baseline trained with a frozen input mesh to the solver. Moreover, with a simple warm-start on the neural network parameters, we show that models trained by these zeroth-order algorithms achieve an accelerated convergence and improved generalization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Scalability of GNNs for Molecular Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11568v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning models has been at the heart of recent revolutions in language modelling and image generation. Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets, resulting in a 30.25% improvement when scaling to 1 billion parameters and 28.98% improvement when increasing size of dataset to eightfold. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 tasks, outclassing previous large models. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Factorisation for Polypharmacy Side Effect Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11374v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse reactions caused by drug combinations are an increasingly common phenomenon, making their accurate prediction an important challenge in modern medicine. However, the polynomial nature of this problem renders lab-based identification of adverse reactions insufficient. Dozens of computational approaches have therefore been proposed for the task in recent years, with varying degrees of success. One group of methods that has seemingly been under-utilised in this area is tensor factorisation, despite their clear applicability to this type of data. In this work, we apply three such models to a benchmark dataset in order to compare them against established techniques. We find, in contrast to previous reports, that for this task tensor factorisation models are competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network models and we recommend that future work in this field considers cheaper methods with linear complexity before running costly deep learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG_GLT-Net: Optimising EEG Graphs for Real-time Motor Imagery Signals Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11075v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-Computer Interfaces connect the brain to external control devices, necessitating the accurate translation of brain signals such as from electroencephalography (EEG) into executable commands. Graph Neural Networks (GCN) have been increasingly applied for classifying EEG Motor Imagery signals, primarily because they incorporates the spatial relationships among EEG channels, resulting in improved accuracy over traditional convolutional methods. Recent advances by GCNs-Net in real-time EEG MI signal classification utilised Pearson Coefficient Correlation (PCC) for constructing adjacency matrices, yielding significant results on the PhysioNet dataset. Our paper introduces the EEG Graph Lottery Ticket (EEG_GLT) algorithm, an innovative technique for constructing adjacency matrices for EEG channels. It does not require pre-existing knowledge of inter-channel relationships, and it can be tailored to suit both individual subjects and GCN model architectures. Our findings demonstrated that the PCC method outperformed the Geodesic approach by 9.65% in mean accuracy, while our EEG_GLT matrix consistently exceeded the performance of the PCC method by a mean accuracy of 13.39%. Also, we found that the construction of the adjacency matrix significantly influenced accuracy, to a greater extent than GCN model configurations. A basic GCN configuration utilising our EEG_GLT matrix exceeded the performance of even the most complex GCN setup with a PCC matrix in average accuracy. Our EEG_GLT method also reduced MACs by up to 97% compared to the PCC method, while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. In conclusion, the EEG_GLT algorithm marks a breakthrough in the development of optimal adjacency matrices, effectively boosting both computational accuracy and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time classification of EEG MI signals that demand intensive computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Such graphs are essential for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for handling this graph-structured data. Although gradient descent is commonly utilized for training GNNs for node classification, this study ventures into alternative methods, eliminating the iterative optimization processes. We introduce TrainlessGNN, a linear GNN model capitalizing on the observation that text encodings from the same class often cluster together in a linear subspace. This model constructs a weight matrix to represent each class's node attribute subspace, offering an efficient approach to semi-supervised node classification on TAG. Extensive experiments reveal that our trainless models can either match or even surpass their conventionally trained counterparts, demonstrating the possibility of refraining from gradient descent in certain configurations.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Graph Continual Learning with Debiased Lossless Memory Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10984v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life graph data often expands continually, rendering the learning of graph neural networks (GNNs) on static graph data impractical. Graph continual learning (GCL) tackles this problem by continually adapting GNNs to the expanded graph of the current task while maintaining the performance over the graph of previous tasks. Memory replay-based methods, which aim to replay data of previous tasks when learning new tasks, have been explored as one principled approach to mitigate the forgetting of the knowledge learned from the previous tasks. In this paper we extend this methodology with a novel framework, called Debiased Lossless Memory replay (DeLoMe). Unlike existing methods that sample nodes/edges of previous graphs to construct the memory, DeLoMe learns small lossless synthetic node representations as the memory. The learned memory can not only preserve the graph data privacy but also capture the holistic graph information, for which the sampling-based methods are not viable. Further, prior methods suffer from bias toward the current task due to the data imbalance between the classes in the memory data and the current data. A debiased GCL loss function is devised in DeLoMe to effectively alleviate this bias. Extensive experiments on four graph datasets show the effectiveness of DeLoMe under both class- and task-incremental learning settings.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in jet tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in high-energy physics experiments.

Recent developments in Object-Centric Process Mining have enriched event data with objects and their explicit relations between events. To leverage this enriched data, we propose the Heterogeneous Object Event Graph encoding (HOEG), which integrates events and objects into a graph structure with diverse node types. It does so without aggregating object features, thus creating a more nuanced and informative representation. We then adopt a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network architecture, which incorporates these diverse object features in prediction tasks. We evaluate the performance and scalability of HOEG in predicting remaining time, benchmarking it against two established graph-based encodings and two baseline models. Our evaluation uses three Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs), including one from a real-life process at a major Dutch financial institution. The results indicate that HOEG competes well with existing models and surpasses them when OCELs contain informative object attributes and event-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to 36th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAISE), 2024</p></details> |

However, few existing studies have delved into the utilization of node attributes in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). In this paper, we investigate the impact of inter-node attribute disparities on HGNNs performance within the benchmark task, i.e., node classification, and empirically find that typical models exhibit significant performance decline when classifying nodes whose attributes markedly differ from their neighbors. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Attribute-Guided heterogeneous Information Networks representation learning model with Transformer (AGHINT), which allows a more effective aggregation of neighbor node information under the guidance of attributes. Specifically, AGHINT transcends the constraints of the original graph structure by directly integrating higher-order similar neighbor features into the learning process and modifies the message-passing mechanism between nodes based on their attribute disparities. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graph benchmarks with target node attributes demonstrate that AGHINT outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Specifically, optimization-based smoothing is used for high-quality mesh smoothing, but it incurs significant computational overhead. Pioneer works improve its smoothing efficiency by adopting supervised learning to learn smoothing methods from high-quality meshes. However, they pose difficulty in smoothing the mesh nodes with varying degrees and also need data augmentation to address the node input sequence problem. Additionally, the required labeled high-quality meshes further limit the applicability of the proposed method. In this paper, we present GMSNet, a lightweight neural network model for intelligent mesh smoothing. GMSNet adopts graph neural networks to extract features of the node's neighbors and output the optimal node position. During smoothing, we also introduce a fault-tolerance mechanism to prevent GMSNet from generating negative volume elements. With a lightweight model, GMSNet can effectively smoothing mesh nodes with varying degrees and remain unaffected by the order of input data. A novel loss function, MetricLoss, is also developed to eliminate the need for high-quality meshes, which provides a stable and rapid convergence during training. We compare GMSNet with commonly used mesh smoothing methods on two-dimensional triangle meshes. The experimental results show that GMSNet achieves outstanding mesh smoothing performances with 5% model parameters of the previous model, and attains 13.56 times faster than optimization-based smoothing.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD) is the scarcity of high-quality data, which often requires extensive wet-lab work. A typical example of this is pharmacokinetic experiments. In this work, we develop a physical formula enhanced mul-ti-task learning (PEMAL) method that predicts four key parameters of pharmacokinetics simultaneously. By incorporating physical formulas into the multi-task framework, PEMAL facilitates effective knowledge sharing and target alignment among the pharmacokinetic parameters, thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction. Our experiments reveal that PEMAL significantly lowers the data demand, compared to typical Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that PEMAL enhances the robustness to noise, an advantage that conventional Neural Networks do not possess. Another advantage of PEMAL is its high flexibility, which can be potentially applied to other multi-task machine learning scenarios. Overall, our work illustrates the benefits and potential of using PEMAL in AIDD and other scenarios with data scarcity and noise.</p></details> |  |

Existing spectral GNNs mainly emphasize polynomial properties in filter design, introducing computational overhead and neglecting the integration of crucial graph structure information. We argue that incorporating graph information into basis construction can enhance understanding of polynomial basis, and further facilitate simplified polynomial filter design. Motivated by this, we first propose a Positive and Negative Coupling Analysis (PNCA) framework, where the concepts of positive and negative activation are defined and their respective and mixed effects are analysed. Then, we explore PNCA from the message propagation perspective, revealing the subtle information hidden in the activation process. Subsequently, PNCA is used to analyze the mainstream polynomial filters, and a novel simple basis that decouples the positive and negative activation and fully utilizes graph structure information is designed. Finally, a simple GNN (called GSCNet) is proposed based on the new basis. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets for node classification verify that our GSCNet obtains better or comparable results compared with existing state-of-the-art GNNs while demanding relatively less computational time.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</p></details> |  |
| **[DE-HNN: An effective neural model for Circuit Netlist representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00477v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The run-time for optimization tools used in chip design has grown with the complexity of designs to the point where it can take several days to go through one design cycle which has become a bottleneck. Designers want fast tools that can quickly give feedback on a design. Using the input and output data of the tools from past designs, one can attempt to build a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of a design in significantly shorter time than running the tool. The accuracy of such models is affected by the representation of the design data, which is usually a netlist that describes the elements of the digital circuit and how they are connected. Graph representations for the netlist together with graph neural networks have been investigated for such models. However, the characteristics of netlists pose several challenges for existing graph learning frameworks, due to the large number of nodes and the importance of long-range interactions between nodes. To address these challenges, we represent the netlist as a directed hypergraph and propose a Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Network (DE-HNN) for the effective learning of (directed) hypergraphs. Theoretically, we show that our DE-HNN can universally approximate any node or hyperedge based function that satisfies certain permutation equivariant and invariant properties natural for directed hypergraphs. We compare the proposed DE-HNN with several State-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models for (hyper)graphs and netlists, and show that the DE-HNN significantly outperforms them in predicting the outcome of optimized place-and-route tools directly from the input netlists. Our source code and the netlists data used are publicly available at https://github.com/YusuLab/chips.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Causal Representation Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03597v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph few-shot learning (HGFL) has been developed to address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which consist of various types of nodes and edges. The core concept of HGFL is to extract knowledge from rich-labeled classes in a source HG, transfer this knowledge to a target HG to facilitate learning new classes with few-labeled training data, and finally make predictions on unlabeled testing data. Existing methods typically assume that the source HG, training data, and testing data all share the same distribution. However, in practice, distribution shifts among these three types of data are inevitable due to two reasons: (1) the limited availability of the source HG that matches the target HG distribution, and (2) the unpredictable data generation mechanism of the target HG. Such distribution shifts result in ineffective knowledge transfer and poor learning performance in existing methods, thereby leading to a novel problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in HGFL. To address this challenging problem, we propose a novel Causal OOD Heterogeneous graph Few-shot learning model, namely COHF. In COHF, we first characterize distribution shifts in HGs with a structural causal model, establishing an invariance principle for OOD generalization in HGFL. Then, following this invariance principle, we propose a new variational autoencoder-based heterogeneous graph neural network to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts. Finally, by integrating this network with a novel meta-learning framework, COHF effectively transfers knowledge to the target HG to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of COHF over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of Graph Neural Networks through the Lens of Homomorphism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06079v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the celebrated popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across numerous applications, the ability of GNNs to generalize remains less explored. In this work, we propose to study the generalization of GNNs through a novel perspective - analyzing the entropy of graph homomorphism. By linking graph homomorphism with information-theoretic measures, we derive generalization bounds for both graph and node classifications. These bounds are capable of capturing subtleties inherent in various graph structures, including but not limited to paths, cycles and cliques. This enables a data-dependent generalization analysis with robust theoretical guarantees. To shed light on the generality of of our proposed bounds, we present a unifying framework that can characterize a broad spectrum of GNN models through the lens of graph homomorphism. We validate the practical applicability of our theoretical findings by showing the alignment between the proposed bounds and the empirically observed generalization gaps over both real-world and synthetic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Two-Stage Stance Labeling: User-Hashtag Heuristics with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10228v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high volume and rapid evolution of content on social media present major challenges for studying the stance of social media users. In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Experiments demonstrate that our user-hashtag heuristic and the semi-supervised GNN method outperform zero-shot stance labeling using LLMs such as GPT4. Further analysis illustrates how the stance labeling information and interaction graph can be used for evaluating the polarization of social media interactions on divisive issues such as climate change and gun control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06177v5)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Tree Containment Problem Using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09812v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree Containment is a fundamental problem in phylogenetics useful for verifying a proposed phylogenetic network, representing the evolutionary history of certain species. Tree Containment asks whether the given phylogenetic tree (for instance, constructed from a DNA fragment showing tree-like evolution) is contained in the given phylogenetic network. In the general case, this is an NP-complete problem. We propose to solve it approximately using Graph Neural Networks. In particular, we propose to combine the given network and the tree and apply a Graph Neural Network to this network-tree graph. This way, we achieve the capability of solving the tree containment instances representing a larger number of species than the instances contained in the training dataset (i.e., our algorithm has the inductive learning ability). Our algorithm demonstrates an accuracy of over $95\%$ in solving the tree containment problem on instances with up to 100 leaves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Adaptive Graph Neural Networks for Constraining Cosmological Parameters Across Multiple Data Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01588v3)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have been shown to outperform methods that rely on summary statistics, like the power spectrum, in extracting information from complex cosmological data sets. However, due to differences in the subgrid physics implementation and numerical approximations across different simulation suites, models trained on data from one cosmological simulation show a drop in performance when tested on another. Similarly, models trained on any of the simulations would also likely experience a drop in performance when applied to observational data. Training on data from two different suites of the CAMELS hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, we examine the generalization capabilities of Domain Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (DA-GNNs). By utilizing GNNs, we capitalize on their capacity to capture structured scale-free cosmological information from galaxy distributions. Moreover, by including unsupervised domain adaptation via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), we enable our models to extract domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that DA-GNN achieves higher accuracy and robustness on cross-dataset tasks (up to $28\%$ better relative error and up to almost an order of magnitude better $\chi^2$). Using data visualizations, we show the effects of domain adaptation on proper latent space data alignment. This shows that DA-GNNs are a promising method for extracting domain-independent cosmological information, a vital step toward robust deep learning for real cosmic survey data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at NeurIPS 2023; 9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Elevating Spectral GNNs through Enhanced Band-pass Filter Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15354v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted great attention due to their capacity to capture patterns in the frequency domains with essential graph filters. Polynomial-based ones (namely poly-GNNs), which approximately construct graph filters with conventional or rational polynomials, are routinely adopted in practice for their substantial performances on graph learning tasks. However, previous poly-GNNs aim at achieving overall lower approximation error on different types of filters, e.g., low-pass and high-pass, but ignore a key question: \textit{which type of filter warrants greater attention for poly-GNNs?} In this paper, we first show that poly-GNN with a better approximation for band-pass graph filters performs better on graph learning tasks. This insight further sheds light on critical issues of existing poly-GNNs, i.e., those poly-GNNs achieve trivial performance in approximating band-pass graph filters, hindering the great potential of poly-GNNs. To tackle the issues, we propose a novel poly-GNN named TrigoNet. TrigoNet constructs different graph filters with novel trigonometric polynomial, and achieves leading performance in approximating band-pass graph filters against other polynomials. By applying Taylor expansion and deserting nonlinearity, TrigoNet achieves noticeable efficiency among baselines. Extensive experiments show the advantages of TrigoNet in both accuracy performances and efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Enhancing Code Vulnerability Detection via Vulnerability-Preserving Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09599v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source code vulnerability detection aims to identify inherent vulnerabilities to safeguard software systems from potential attacks. Many prior studies overlook diverse vulnerability characteristics, simplifying the problem into a binary (0-1) classification task for example determining whether it is vulnerable or not. This poses a challenge for a single deep learning-based model to effectively learn the wide array of vulnerability characteristics. Furthermore, due to the challenges associated with collecting large-scale vulnerability data, these detectors often overfit limited training datasets, resulting in lower model generalization performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we introduce a fine-grained vulnerability detector namely FGVulDet. Unlike previous approaches, FGVulDet employs multiple classifiers to discern characteristics of various vulnerability types and combines their outputs to identify the specific type of vulnerability. Each classifier is designed to learn type-specific vulnerability semantics. Additionally, to address the scarcity of data for some vulnerability types and enhance data diversity for learning better vulnerability semantics, we propose a novel vulnerability-preserving data augmentation technique to augment the number of vulnerabilities. Taking inspiration from recent advancements in graph neural networks for learning program semantics, we incorporate a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) and extend it to an edge-aware GGNN to capture edge-type information. FGVulDet is trained on a large-scale dataset from GitHub, encompassing five different types of vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments compared with static-analysis-based approaches and learning-based approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of FGVulDet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference from Real-World Sparse Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11269v7)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world problems often involve complex and unstructured sets of measurements, which occur when sensors are sparsely placed in either space or time. Being able to model this irregular spatiotemporal data and extract meaningful forecasts is crucial. Deep learning architectures capable of processing sets of measurements with positions varying from set to set, and extracting readouts anywhere are methodologically difficult. Current state-of-the-art models are graph neural networks and require domain-specific knowledge for proper setup. We propose an attention-based model focused on robustness and practical applicability, with two key design contributions. First, we adopt a ViT-like transformer that takes both context points and read-out positions as inputs, eliminating the need for an encoder-decoder structure. Second, we use a unified method for encoding both context and read-out positions. This approach is intentionally straightforward and integrates well with other systems. Compared to existing approaches, our model is simpler, requires less specialized knowledge, and does not suffer from a problematic bottleneck effect, all of which contribute to superior performance. We conduct in-depth ablation studies that characterize this problematic bottleneck in the latent representations of alternative models that inhibit information utilization and impede training efficiency. We also perform experiments across various problem domains, including high-altitude wind nowcasting, two-day weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, and heat diffusion. Our attention-based model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in handling irregularly sampled data. Notably, our model reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) for wind nowcasting from 9.24 to 7.98 and for heat diffusion tasks from 0.126 to 0.084.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 12 figures, Published at TMLR https://openreview.net/forum?id=y9IDfODRns</p></details> |

However, balancing GNNs training runtime cost, memory consumption, and attainable accuracy for various applications is non-trivial. Previous training methodologies suffer from inferior adaptability and lack a unified training optimization solution. To address the problem, this work proposes GNNavigator, an adaptive GNN training configuration optimization framework. GNNavigator meets diverse GNN application requirements due to our unified software-hardware co-abstraction, proposed GNNs training performance model, and practical design space exploration solution. Experimental results show that GNNavigator can achieve up to 3.1x speedup and 44.9% peak memory reduction with comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by DAC'24 |
| **[On the Stability of Expressive Positional Encodings for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02579v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) \emph{Non-uniqueness}: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) \emph{Instability}: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address non-uniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a ``hard partition'' of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to ``softly partition'' eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods.

| **[Data Imputation with Iterative Graph Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02810v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective data imputation demands rich latent ``structure" discovery capabilities from ``plain" tabular data. Recent advances in graph neural networks-based data imputation solutions show their strong structure learning potential by directly translating tabular data as bipartite graphs. However, due to a lack of relations between samples, those solutions treat all samples equally which is against one important observation: ``similar sample should give more information about missing values." This paper presents a novel Iterative graph Generation and Reconstruction framework for Missing data imputation(IGRM). Instead of treating all samples equally, we introduce the concept: ``friend networks" to represent different relations among samples. To generate an accurate friend network with missing data, an end-to-end friend network reconstruction solution is designed to allow for continuous friend network optimization during imputation learning. The representation of the optimized friend network, in turn, is used to further optimize the data imputation process with differentiated message passing. Experiment results on eight benchmark datasets show that IGRM yields 39.13% lower mean absolute error compared with nine baselines and 9.04% lower than the second-best. Our code is available at https://github.com/G-AILab/IGRM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in AAAI2023</p></details> |
| **[AFDGCF: Adaptive Feature De-correlation Graph Collaborative Filtering for Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17416v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have witnessed significant success in recommender systems (RS), capitalizing on their ability to capture collaborative signals within intricate user-item relationships via message-passing mechanisms. However, these GNN-based RS inadvertently introduce excess linear correlation between user and item embeddings, contradicting the goal of providing personalized recommendations. While existing research predominantly ascribes this flaw to the over-smoothing problem, this paper underscores the critical, often overlooked role of the over-correlation issue in diminishing the effectiveness of GNN representations and subsequent recommendation performance. Up to now, the over-correlation issue remains unexplored in RS. Meanwhile, how to mitigate the impact of over-correlation while preserving collaborative filtering signals is a significant challenge. To this end, this paper aims to address the aforementioned gap by undertaking a comprehensive study of the over-correlation issue in graph collaborative filtering models. Firstly, we present empirical evidence to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of over-correlation in these models. Subsequently, we dive into a theoretical analysis which establishes a pivotal connection between the over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Adaptive Feature De-correlation Graph Collaborative Filtering (AFDGCF) framework, which dynamically applies correlation penalties to the feature dimensions of the representation matrix, effectively alleviating both over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. The efficacy of the proposed framework is corroborated through extensive experiments conducted with four representative graph collaborative filtering models across four publicly available datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR2024</p></details> |
