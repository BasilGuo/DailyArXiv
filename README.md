| **[Reconstruction of neuromorphic dynamics from a single scalar time series using variational autoencoder and neural network map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07055v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the reconstruction of a family of dynamical systems with neuromorphic behavior using a single scalar time series. A model of a physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered. Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First, the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging LSTM for Predictive Modeling of Satellite Clock Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07015v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite clock bias prediction plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of satellite navigation systems. In this paper, we propose an approach utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict satellite clock bias. We gather data from the PRN 8 satellite of the Galileo and preprocess it to obtain a single difference sequence, crucial for normalizing the data. Normalization allows resampling of the data, ensuring that the predictions are equidistant and complete. Our methodology involves training the LSTM model on varying lengths of datasets, ranging from 7 days to 31 days. We employ a training set consisting of two days' worth of data in each case. Our LSTM model exhibits exceptional accuracy, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Notably, our approach outperforms traditional methods used for similar time-series forecasting projects, being 170 times more accurate than RNN, 2.3 $\times$ 10$^7$ times more accurate than MLP, and 1.9 $\times$ 10$^4$ times more accurate than ARIMA. This study holds significant potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of low-power receivers used in various devices, particularly those requiring power conservation. By providing more accurate predictions of satellite clock bias, the findings of this research can be integrated into the algorithms of such devices, enabling them to function with heightened precision while conserving power. Improved accuracy in clock bias predictions ensures that low-power receivers can maintain optimal performance levels, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and effectiveness of satellite navigation systems. Consequently, this advancement holds promise for a wide range of applications, including remote areas, IoT devices, wearable technology, and other devices where power efficiency and navigation accuracy are paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 6 figures (8 sub-figures), 5 Tables Index Terms-LSTM, Satellite Navigation, Deep Learning, Clock Bias</p></details> |
| **[Causal-discovery-based root-cause analysis and its application in time-series prediction error diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06990v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rapid advancements of machine learning have greatly enhanced the accuracy of prediction models, but most models remain "black boxes", making prediction error diagnosis challenging, especially with outliers. This lack of transparency hinders trust and reliability in industrial applications. Heuristic attribution methods, while helpful, often fail to capture true causal relationships, leading to inaccurate error attributions. Various root-cause analysis methods have been developed using Shapley values, yet they typically require predefined causal graphs, limiting their applicability for prediction errors in machine learning models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal-Discovery-based Root-Cause Analysis (CD-RCA) method that estimates causal relationships between the prediction error and the explanatory variables, without needing a pre-defined causal graph. By simulating synthetic error data, CD-RCA can identify variable contributions to outliers in prediction errors by Shapley values. Extensive simulations show CD-RCA outperforms current heuristic attribution methods, and a sensitivity analysis reveals new patterns where Shapley values may misattribute errors, paving the way for more accurate error attribution methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages with 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Detecting relevant deviations from the white noise assumption for non-stationary time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06909v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of detecting deviations from a white noise assumption in time series. Our approach differs from the numerous methods proposed for this purpose with respect to two aspects. First, we allow for non-stationary time series. Second, we address the problem that a white noise test, for example checking the residuals of a model fit, is usually not performed because one believes in this hypothesis, but thinks that the white noise hypothesis may be approximately true, because a postulated models describes the unknown relation well. This reflects a meanwhile classical paradigm of Box(1976) that "all models are wrong but some are useful". We address this point of view by investigating if the maximum deviation of the local autocovariance functions from 0 exceeds a given threshold $\Delta$ that can either be specified by the user or chosen in a data dependent way. The formulation of the problem in this form raises several mathematical challenges, which do not appear when one is testing the classical white noise hypothesis. We use high dimensional Gaussian approximations for dependent data to furnish a bootstrap test, prove its validity and showcase its performance on both synthetic and real data, in particular we inspect log returns of stock prices and show that our approach reflects some observations of Fama(1970) regarding the efficient market hypothesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing research literature attitude towards Sustainable Development Goals: an LLM-based topic modeling approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02943v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The world is facing a multitude of challenges that hinder the development of human civilization and the well-being of humanity on the planet. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations in 2015 to address these global challenges by 2030. Natural language processing techniques can help uncover discussions on SDGs within research literature. We propose a completely automated pipeline to 1) fetch content from the Scopus database and prepare datasets dedicated to five groups of SDGs; 2) perform topic modeling, a statistical technique used to identify topics in large collections of textual data; and 3) enable topic exploration through keywords-based search and topic frequency time series extraction. For topic modeling, we leverage the stack of BERTopic scaled up to be applied on large corpora of textual documents (we find hundreds of topics on hundreds of thousands of documents), introducing i) a novel LLM-based embeddings computation for representing scientific abstracts in the continuous space and ii) a hyperparameter optimizer to efficiently find the best configuration for any new big datasets. We additionally produce the visualization of results on interactive dashboards reporting topics' temporal evolution. Results are made inspectable and explorable, contributing to the interpretability of the topic modeling process. Our proposed LLM-based topic modeling pipeline for big-text datasets allows users to capture insights on the evolution of the attitude toward SDGs within scientific abstracts in the 2006-2023 time span. All the results are reproducible by using our system; the workflow can be generalized to be applied at any point in time to any big corpus of textual documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[TX-Gen: Multi-Objective Optimization for Sparse Counterfactual Explanations for Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09461v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-series classification, understanding model decisions is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EXPLAINS 2024</p></details> |
| **[MP-PINN: A Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network for Epidemic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06781v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting temporal processes such as virus spreading in epidemics often requires more than just observed time-series data, especially at the beginning of a wave when data is limited. Traditional methods employ mechanistic models like the SIR family, which make strong assumptions about the underlying spreading process, often represented as a small set of compact differential equations. Data-driven methods such as deep neural networks make no such assumptions and can capture the generative process in more detail, but fail in long-term forecasting due to data limitations. We propose a new hybrid method called MP-PINN (Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network) to overcome the limitations of these two major approaches. MP-PINN instils the spreading mechanism into a neural network, enabling the mechanism to update in phases over time, reflecting the dynamics of the epidemics due to policy interventions. Experiments on COVID-19 waves demonstrate that MP-PINN achieves superior performance over pure data-driven or model-driven approaches for both short-term and long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Research on an intelligent fault diagnosis method for nuclear power plants based on ETCN-SSA combined algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06765v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing fault diagnosis methods is crucial for nuclear power professionals to achieve efficient and accurate fault diagnosis for nuclear power plants (NPPs). The performance of traditional methods is limited by their dependence on complex feature extraction and skilled expert knowledge, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This paper proposes a novel intelligent fault diagnosis method for NPPs that combines enhanced temporal convolutional network (ETCN) with sparrow search algorithm (SSA). ETCN utilizes temporal convolutional network (TCN), self-attention (SA) mechanism and residual block for enhancing performance. ETCN excels at extracting local features and capturing time series information, while SSA adaptively optimizes its hyperparameters for superior performance. The proposed method's performance is experimentally verified on a CPR1000 simulation dataset. Compared to other advanced intelligent fault diagnosis methods, the proposed one demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics. This makes it a promising tool for NPP intelligent fault diagnosis, ultimately enhancing operational reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Forecaster: Jointly Predicting Time Series and Textual Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06735v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current forecasting approaches are largely unimodal and ignore the rich textual data that often accompany the time series due to lack of well-curated multimodal benchmark dataset. In this work, we develop TimeText Corpus (TTC), a carefully curated, time-aligned text and time dataset for multimodal forecasting. Our dataset is composed of sequences of numbers and text aligned to timestamps, and includes data from two different domains: climate science and healthcare. Our data is a significant contribution to the rare selection of available multimodal datasets. We also propose the Hybrid Multi-Modal Forecaster (Hybrid-MMF), a multimodal LLM that jointly forecasts both text and time series data using shared embeddings. However, contrary to our expectations, our Hybrid-MMF model does not outperform existing baselines in our experiments. This negative result highlights the challenges inherent in multimodal forecasting. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/Multimodal_ Forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[GIFT-Eval: A Benchmark For General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10393v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models excel in zero-shot forecasting, handling diverse tasks without explicit training. However, the advancement of these models has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation, GIFT-Eval, a pioneering benchmark aimed at promoting evaluation across diverse datasets. GIFT-Eval encompasses 23 datasets over 144,000 time series and 177 million data points, spanning seven domains, 10 frequencies, multivariate inputs, and prediction lengths ranging from short to long-term forecasts. To facilitate the effective pretraining and evaluation of foundation models, we also provide a non-leaking pretraining dataset containing approximately 230 billion data points. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of 17 baselines, which includes statistical models, deep learning models, and foundation models. We discuss each model in the context of various benchmark characteristics and offer a qualitative analysis that spans both deep learning and foundation models. We believe the insights from this analysis, along with access to this new standard zero-shot time series forecasting benchmark, will guide future developments in time series foundation models. Code, data, and the leaderboard can be found at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/gift-eval .</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072v4)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/TimeXer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reasoning in Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10840v4)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, time series foundation models have shown promising zero-shot forecasting performance on time series from a wide range of domains. However, it remains unclear whether their success stems from a true understanding of temporal dynamics or simply from memorizing the training data. While implicit reasoning in language models has been studied, similar evaluations for time series models have been largely unexplored. This work takes an initial step toward assessing the reasoning abilities of deep time series forecasting models. We find that certain linear, MLP-based, and patch-based Transformer models generalize effectively in systematically orchestrated out-of-distribution scenarios, suggesting underexplored reasoning capabilities beyond simple pattern memorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Principal Component Analysis for Large-dimensional Matrix Factor Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06423v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix factor models have been growing popular dimension reduction tools for large-dimensional matrix time series. However, the heteroscedasticity of the idiosyncratic components has barely received any attention. Starting from the pseudo likelihood function, this paper introduces a Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) method for matrix factor model which takes the heteroscedasticity into account. Theoretically, we first derive the asymptotic distribution of the GPCA estimators by assuming the separable covariance matrices are known in advance. We then propose adaptive thresholding estimators for the separable covariance matrices and show that this would not alter the asymptotic distribution of the GPCA estimators under certain regular sparsity conditions in the high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation literature. The GPCA estimators are shown to be more efficient than the state-of-the-art methods under certain heteroscedasticity conditions. Thorough numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing approaches. Analysis of a financial portfolio dataset illustrates the empirical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditioning non-linear and infinite-dimensional diffusion processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01434v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models and many stochastic models in science and engineering naturally live in infinite dimensions before discretisation. To incorporate observed data for statistical and learning tasks, one needs to condition on observations. While recent work has treated conditioning linear processes in infinite dimensions, conditioning non-linear processes in infinite dimensions has not been explored. This paper conditions function valued stochastic processes without prior discretisation. To do so, we use an infinite-dimensional version of Girsanov's theorem to condition a function-valued stochastic process, leading to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the conditioned process involving the score. We apply this technique to do time series analysis for shapes of organisms in evolutionary biology, where we discretise via the Fourier basis and then learn the coefficients of the score function with score matching methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local vs. Global Models for Hierarchical Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06394v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical time series forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making in various domains while presenting significant challenges for modelling as they involve multiple levels of aggregation, constraints, and availability of information. This study explores the influence of distinct information utilisation on the accuracy of hierarchical forecasts, proposing and evaluating locals and a range of Global Forecasting Models (GFMs). In contrast to local models, which forecast each series independently, we develop GFMs to exploit cross-series and cross-hierarchies information, improving both forecasting performance and computational efficiency. We employ reconciliation methods to ensure coherency in forecasts and use the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) tests to assess statistical significance. The findings indicate that GFMs possess significant advantages for hierarchical forecasting, providing more accurate and computationally efficient solutions across different levels in a hierarchy. Two specific GFMs based on LightGBM are introduced, demonstrating superior accuracy and lower model complexity than their counterpart local models and conventional methods such as Exponential Smoothing (ES) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven ODE modeling of the high-frequency complex dynamics via a low-frequency dynamics model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00668v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our previous paper [N. Tsutsumi, K. Nakai and Y. Saiki, Chaos 32, 091101 (2022)], we proposed a method for constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior from only observable deterministic time series, which we call the radial function-based regression (RfR) method. However, when the targeted variable's behavior is rather complex, the direct application of the RfR method does not function well. In this study, we propose a novel method of modeling such dynamics, including the high-frequency intermittent behavior of a fluid flow, by considering another variable (base variable) showing relatively simple, less intermittent behavior. We construct an autonomous joint model composed of two parts: the first is an autonomous system of a base variable, and the other concerns the targeted variable being affected by a term involving the base variable to demonstrate complex dynamics. The constructed joint model succeeded in not only inferring a short trajectory but also reconstructing chaotic sets and statistical properties obtained from a long trajectory such as the density distributions of the actual dynamics.</p></details> | 7pages, 6figures |
| **[When are dynamical systems learned from time series data statistically accurate?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06311v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</p></details> | in NeuRIPS 2024 |
| **[Acoustic Volume Rendering for Neural Impulse Response Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06307v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic audio synthesis that captures accurate acoustic phenomena is essential for creating immersive experiences in virtual and augmented reality. Synthesizing the sound received at any position relies on the estimation of impulse response (IR), which characterizes how sound propagates in one scene along different paths before arriving at the listener's position. In this paper, we present Acoustic Volume Rendering (AVR), a novel approach that adapts volume rendering techniques to model acoustic impulse responses. While volume rendering has been successful in modeling radiance fields for images and neural scene representations, IRs present unique challenges as time-series signals. To address these challenges, we introduce frequency-domain volume rendering and use spherical integration to fit the IR measurements. Our method constructs an impulse response field that inherently encodes wave propagation principles and achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing impulse responses for novel poses. Experiments show that AVR surpasses current leading methods by a substantial margin. Additionally, we develop an acoustic simulation platform, AcoustiX, which provides more accurate and realistic IR simulations than existing simulators. Code for AVR and AcoustiX are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/avr.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[FAN: Fourier Analysis Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02675v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success achieved by neural networks, particularly those represented by MLP and Transformer, we reveal that they exhibit potential flaws in the modeling and reasoning of periodicity, i.e., they tend to memorize the periodic data rather than genuinely understanding the underlying principles of periodicity. However, periodicity is a crucial trait in various forms of reasoning and generalization, underpinning predictability across natural and engineered systems through recurring patterns in observations. In this paper, we propose FAN, a novel network architecture based on Fourier Analysis, which empowers the ability to efficiently model and reason about periodic phenomena. By introducing Fourier Series, the periodicity is naturally integrated into the structure and computational processes of the neural network, thus achieving a more accurate expression and prediction of periodic patterns. As a promising substitute to multi-layer perceptron (MLP), FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various models with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FAN in modeling and reasoning about periodic functions, and the superiority and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, including symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, and language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Prediction of Natural Gas Pipeline Leaks Using the MKTCN Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06214v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural gas pipeline leaks pose severe risks, leading to substantial economic losses and potential hazards to human safety. In this study, we develop an accurate model for the early prediction of pipeline leaks. To the best of our knowledge, unlike previous anomaly detection, this is the first application to use internal pipeline data for early prediction of leaks. The modeling process addresses two main challenges: long-term dependencies and sample imbalance. First, we introduce a dilated convolution-based prediction model to capture long-term dependencies, as dilated convolution expands the model's receptive field without added computational cost. Second, to mitigate sample imbalance, we propose the MKTCN model, which incorporates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network as the fully connected layer in a dilated convolution model, enhancing network generalization. Finally, we validate the MKTCN model through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that MKTCN outperforms in generalization and classification, particularly under severe data imbalance, and effectively predicts leaks up to 5000 seconds in advance. Overall, the MKTCN model represents a significant advancement in early pipeline leak prediction, providing robust generalization and improved modeling of the long-term dependencies inherent in multi-dimensional time-series data.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

KANs distinguish themselves from traditional neural networks by using learnable, spline-parameterized functions instead of fixed activation functions, allowing for flexible and interpretable representations of high-dimensional functions. This review details KAN's architectural strengths, including adaptive edge-based activation functions that improve parameter efficiency and scalability in applications such as time series forecasting, computational biomedicine, and graph learning. Key advancements, including Temporal-KAN, FastKAN, and Partial Differential Equation (PDE) KAN, illustrate KAN's growing applicability in dynamic environments, enhancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and adaptability for complex function approximation tasks. Additionally, this paper discusses KAN's integration with other architectures, such as convolutional, recurrent, and transformer-based models, showcasing its versatility in complementing established neural networks for tasks requiring hybrid approaches. Despite its strengths, KAN faces computational challenges in high-dimensional and noisy data settings, motivating ongoing research into optimization strategies, regularization techniques, and hybrid models. This paper highlights KAN's role in modern neural architectures and outlines future directions to improve its computational efficiency, interpretability, and scalability in data-intensive applications.</p></details> |  |

The primary contribution of this work lies in demonstrating the effectiveness of combining time series representation learning with LLM prediction frameworks. We showcase BreakGPT as a promising solution for financial forecasting with minimal training and as a strong competitor for capturing both local and global temporal dependencies.</p></details> |  |

The experiment, known as the Millenium Tillage Trial (MTT), ran on 42 field-plots for ten years from 2000-2010; here CQUESST is used to model soil carbon dynamically in six pools, in each of the 42 agricultural plots, and on a monthly time step for a decade. We show how CQUESST can be used to estimate soil-carbon cycling rates under different treatments. Our methods provide much-needed statistical tools for quantitatively inferring the effectiveness of different experimental treatments on soil-carbon sequestration. The decade-long data are of multiple observation types, and these interacting time series are ingested into a fully Bayesian model that has a dynamic stochastic model of multiple pools of soil carbon at its core. CQUESST's stochastic model is motivated by the deterministic RothC soil-carbon model based on nonlinear difference equations. We demonstrate how CQUESST can estimate soil-carbon fluxes for different experimental treatments while acknowledging uncertainties in soil-carbon dynamics, in physical parameters, and in observations. CQUESST is implemented efficiently in the probabilistic programming language Stan using its MapReduce parallelization, and it scales well for large numbers of field-plots, using software libraries that allow for computation to be shared over multiple nodes of high-performance computing clusters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-MMD: Multi-Domain Multimodal Dataset for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08627v3)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA. The dataset and library are available at https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD and https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM-TSFlib.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[A Picture is Worth A Thousand Numbers: Enabling LLMs Reason about Time Series via Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06018v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), with demonstrated reasoning abilities across multiple domains, are largely underexplored for time-series reasoning (TsR), which is ubiquitous in the real world. In this work, we propose TimerBed, the first comprehensive testbed for evaluating LLMs' TsR performance. Specifically, TimerBed includes stratified reasoning patterns with real-world tasks, comprehensive combinations of LLMs and reasoning strategies, and various supervised models as comparison anchors. We perform extensive experiments with TimerBed, test multiple current beliefs, and verify the initial failures of LLMs in TsR, evidenced by the ineffectiveness of zero shot (ZST) and performance degradation of few shot in-context learning (ICL). Further, we identify one possible root cause: the numerical modeling of data. To address this, we propose a prompt-based solution VL-Time, using visualization-modeled data and language-guided reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Vl-Time enables multimodal LLMs to be non-trivial ZST and powerful ICL reasoners for time series, achieving about 140% average performance improvement and 99% average token costs reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approaching multifractal complexity in decentralized cryptocurrency trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05951v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multifractality is a concept that helps compactly grasping the most essential features of the financial dynamics. In its fully developed form, this concept applies to essentially all mature financial markets and even to more liquid cryptocurrencies traded on the centralized exchanges. A new element that adds complexity to cryptocurrency markets is the possibility of decentralized trading. Based on the extracted tick-by-tick transaction data from the Universal Router contract of the Uniswap decentralized exchange, from June 6, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the present study using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) shows that even though liquidity on these new exchanges is still much lower compared to centralized exchanges convincing traces of multifractality are already emerging on this new trading as well. The resulting multifractal spectra are however strongly left-side asymmetric which indicates that this multifractality comes primarily from large fluctuations and small ones are more of the uncorrelated noise type. What is particularly interesting here is the fact that multifractality is more developed for time series representing transaction volumes than rates of return. On the level of these larger events a trace of multifractal cross-correlations between the two characteristics is also observed.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, despite their effectiveness, they are often perceived as black boxes capable of providing answers without explaining their decisions, which raises numerous ethical and legal concerns. Fortunately, the field of explainability helps users understand these results.

In this article, we focus on the learning process carried out by a ``time distributed`` convRNN, which performs anomaly detection from video data.</p></details> |  |

In temporal data, static path-based centralities like closeness or betweenness can give misleading results about the true importance of nodes in a temporal graph. To address this issue, temporal generalizations of betweenness and closeness have been defined that are based on the shortest time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. However, a major issue of those generalizations is that the calculation of such paths is computationally expensive. Addressing this issue, we study the application of De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNN), a time-aware graph neural network architecture, to predict temporal path-based centralities in time series data. We experimentally evaluate our approach in 13 temporal graphs from biological and social systems and show that it considerably improves the prediction of betweenness and closeness centrality compared to (i) a static Graph Convolutional Neural Network, (ii) an efficient sampling-based approximation technique for temporal betweenness, and (iii) two state-of-the-art time-aware graph learning techniques for dynamic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Machine learning-driven Anomaly Detection and Forecasting for Euclid Space Telescope Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05596v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art space science missions increasingly rely on automation due to spacecraft complexity and the costs of human oversight. The high volume of data, including scientific and telemetry data, makes manual inspection challenging. Machine learning offers significant potential to meet these demands. The Euclid space telescope, in its survey phase since February 2024, exemplifies this shift. Euclid's success depends on accurate monitoring and interpretation of housekeeping telemetry and science-derived data. Thousands of telemetry parameters, monitored as time series, may or may not impact the quality of scientific data. These parameters have complex interdependencies, often due to physical relationships (e.g., proximity of temperature sensors). Optimising science operations requires careful anomaly detection and identification of hidden parameter states. Moreover, understanding the interactions between known anomalies and physical quantities is crucial yet complex, as related parameters may display anomalies with varied timing and intensity. We address these challenges by analysing temperature anomalies in Euclid's telemetry from February to August 2024, focusing on eleven temperature parameters and 35 covariates. We use a predictive XGBoost model to forecast temperatures based on historical values, detecting anomalies as deviations from predictions. A second XGBoost model predicts anomalies from covariates, capturing their relationships to temperature anomalies. We identify the top three anomalies per parameter and analyse their interactions with covariates using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), enabling rapid, automated analysis of complex parameter relationships. Our method demonstrates how machine learning can enhance telemetry monitoring, offering scalable solutions for other missions with similar data challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IAC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking the Role of Remote Sensors in Comfort, Energy and Demand Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15368v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In single-zone multi-node systems (SZMRSs), temperature controls rely on a single probe near the thermostat, resulting in temperature discrepancies that cause thermal discomfort and energy waste. Augmenting smart thermostats (STs) with per-room sensors has gained acceptance by major ST manufacturers. This paper leverages additional sensory information to empirically characterize the services provided by buildings, including thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and demand response (DR). Utilizing room-level time-series data from 1,000 houses, metadata from 110,000 houses across the United States, and data from two real-world testbeds, we examine the limitations of SZMNSs and explore the potential of remote sensors. We discovered that comfortable DR durations (CDRDs) for rooms are typically 70% longer or 40% shorter than for the room with the thermostat. When averaging, rooms at the control temperature's bounds are typically deviated around -3{\deg}F to 2.5{\deg}F from the average. Moreover, in 95% of houses, we identified rooms experiencing notably higher solar gains compared to the rest of the rooms, while 85% and 70% of houses demonstrated lower heat input and poor insulation, respectively. Lastly, it became evident that the consumption of cooling energy escalates with the increase in the number of sensors, whereas heating usage experiences fluctuations ranging from -19% to +25%. This study serves as a benchmark for assessing the thermal comfort and DR services in the existing housing stock, while also highlighting the energy efficiency impacts of sensing technologies. Our approach sets the stage for more granular, precise control strategies of SZMNSs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Fi...</summary><p>13 Figures, 8 Tables, 25 Pages.

| **[Discovering Latent Structural Causal Models from Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important phenomena in scientific fields such as climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. For example, in climate science, researchers aim to uncover how large-scale events, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), influence other global processes. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to explicitly model latent time-series and their causal relationships from spatially confined modes in the data. Our method uses an end-to-end training process that maximizes an evidence-lower bound (ELBO) for the data likelihood. Theoretically, we show that, under some conditions, the latent variables are identifiable up to transformation by an invertible matrix. Empirically, we show that SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, remains scalable for large grids, and identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.</p></details> |  |

To handle the heavy-tailed dependent data, we propose a Catoni type truncated minimization problem framework and obtain an $\mathcal{O}\big( \big( (d_1+d_2) (d_1\land d_2) \log^2 n / n \big)^{(\alpha - 1)/\alpha} \big)$ order excess risk, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the dimensionality and $n$ is the number of samples. We apply our result to study the LAD regression on high-dimensional heavy-tailed vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Simulations for the VAR($p$) model show that our new estimator with truncation are essential because the risk of the classical LAD has a tendency to blow up. We further apply our estimation to the real data and find that ours fits the data better than the classical LAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Correlated Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01000v4)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling the correlation structure of errors is critical for reliable uncertainty quantification in probabilistic time series forecasting. While recent deep learning models for multivariate time series have developed efficient parameterizations for time-varying contemporaneous covariance, but they often assume temporal independence of errors for simplicity. However, real-world data often exhibit significant error autocorrelation and cross-lag correlation due to factors such as missing covariates. In this paper, we introduce a plug-and-play method that learns the covariance structure of errors over multiple steps for autoregressive models with Gaussian-distributed errors. To ensure scalable inference and computational efficiency, we model the contemporaneous covariance using a low-rank-plus-diagonal parameterization and capture cross-covariance through a group of independent latent temporal processes. The learned covariance matrix is then used to calibrate predictions based on observed residuals. We evaluate our method on probabilistic models built on RNNs and Transformer architectures, and the results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification without significantly increasing the parameter size.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).

Past and future transfer entropy decomposition with the information bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04992v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whether the system under study is a shoal of fish, a collection of neurons, or a set of interacting atmospheric and oceanic processes, transfer entropy measures the flow of information between time series and can detect possible causal relationships. Much like mutual information, transfer entropy is generally reported as a single value summarizing an amount of shared variation, yet a more fine-grained accounting might illuminate much about the processes under study. Here we propose to decompose transfer entropy and localize the bits of variation on both sides of information flow: that of the originating process's past and that of the receiving process's future. We employ the information bottleneck (IB) to compress the time series and identify the transferred entropy. We apply our method to decompose the transfer entropy in several synthetic recurrent processes and an experimental mouse dataset of concurrent behavioral and neural activity. Our approach highlights the nuanced dynamics within information flow, laying a foundation for future explorations into the intricate interplay of temporal processes in complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 workshop "Machine learning and the physical sciences" Camera ready</p></details> |

We formalize and explore an understudied cross-modal transfer setting we term Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA), where the modality used in testing is not used in supervised training, i.e. zero labeled instances of the test modality are available during training. We develop three methods to perform UMA: Student-Teacher (ST), Contrastive Alignment (CA), and Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T). Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets compare these methods to each other in the UMA setting, and to their empirical upper bound in the supervised setting. The results indicate C3T is the most robust and highest performing by at least a margin of 8%, and nears the supervised setting performance even in the presence of temporal noise. This method introduces a novel mechanism for aligning signals across time-varying latent vectors, extracted from the receptive field of temporal convolutions. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for multi-modal learning in various applications.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. The model weights for reproducibility and research use are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm/ttm-research-r2/, while enterprise-use weights under the Apache license can be accessed as follows: the initial TTM-Q variant at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1, and the latest variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, TTM-A) weights are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

This subgrid scale term is tailor-made to capture the statistics of a small set of spatially-integrate quantities of interest (QoIs), with only one unresolved scalar time series per QoI. In contrast to other data-driven surrogates the dimension of the "learning problem" is reduced from an evolving field to one scalar time series per QoI. We use an a-posteriori, nudging approach to find the distribution of the scalar series over time. This approach has the advantage of taking the interaction between the solver and the surrogate into account. A stochastic surrogate parametrization is obtained by random sampling from the found distribution for the scalar time series. Compared to an a-priori trained convolutional neural network, evaluating the new method is computationally much cheaper and gives similar long-term statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Elsevier</p></details> |

Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our comparative benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738), RMSE (4.8553), MAE (3.9991), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[EffiCANet: Efficient Time Series Forecasting with Convolutional Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04669v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of multivariate time series data from sensor networks in domains like industrial monitoring and smart cities requires efficient and accurate forecasting models. Current deep learning methods often fail to adequately capture long-range dependencies and complex inter-variable relationships, especially under real-time processing constraints. These limitations arise as many models are optimized for either short-term forecasting with limited receptive fields or long-term accuracy at the cost of efficiency. Additionally, dynamic and intricate interactions between variables in real-world data further complicate modeling efforts. To address these limitations, we propose EffiCANet, an Efficient Convolutional Attention Network designed to enhance forecasting accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. EffiCANet integrates three key components: (1) a Temporal Large-kernel Decomposed Convolution (TLDC) module that captures long-term temporal dependencies while reducing computational overhead; (2) an Inter-Variable Group Convolution (IVGC) module that captures complex and evolving relationships among variables; and (3) a Global Temporal-Variable Attention (GTVA) mechanism that prioritizes critical temporal and inter-variable features. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets show that EffiCANet achieves the maximum reduction of 10.02% in MAE over state-of-the-art models, while cutting computational costs by 26.2% relative to conventional large-kernel convolution methods, thanks to its efficient decomposition strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Peri-midFormer: Periodic Pyramid Transformer for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04554v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis finds wide applications in fields such as weather forecasting, anomaly detection, and behavior recognition. Previous methods attempted to model temporal variations directly using 1D time series. However, this has been quite challenging due to the discrete nature of data points in time series and the complexity of periodic variation. In terms of periodicity, taking weather and traffic data as an example, there are multi-periodic variations such as yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily, etc. In order to break through the limitations of the previous methods, we decouple the implied complex periodic variations into inclusion and overlap relationships among different level periodic components based on the observation of the multi-periodicity therein and its inclusion relationships. This explicitly represents the naturally occurring pyramid-like properties in time series, where the top level is the original time series and lower levels consist of periodic components with gradually shorter periods, which we call the periodic pyramid. To further extract complex temporal variations, we introduce self-attention mechanism into the periodic pyramid, capturing complex periodic relationships by computing attention between periodic components based on their inclusion, overlap, and adjacency relationships. Our proposed Peri-midFormer demonstrates outstanding performance in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness in deterministic predictions is often constrained by instability arising from their inherent stochasticity. In this paper, we revisit time series diffusion models and present a comprehensive framework that encompasses most existing diffusion-based methods. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel diffusion-based time series forecasting model, the Series-to-Series Diffusion Bridge Model ($\mathrm{S^2DBM}$), which leverages the Brownian Bridge process to reduce randomness in reverse estimations and improves accuracy by incorporating informative priors and conditions derived from historical time series data. Experimental results demonstrate that $\mathrm{S^2DBM}$ delivers superior performance in point-to-point forecasting and competes effectively with other diffusion-based models in probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process.

Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods. and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Health symposium, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on a WF paired with a captive battery energy storage system (BESS). We aim to ascertain the capacity credit for a BESS with specified energy and power ratings. Unlike prior methods rooted in reliability theory, we define a power alignment function, which leads to a straightforward definition of capacity and incremental capacity for the BESS. We develop a solution method based on a linear programming formulation. Our analysis utilizes wind data, collected by NYSERDA off Long Island's coast and load demand data from NYISO. Additionally, we present theoretical insights into BESS sizing and a key time-series property influencing BESS capacity, aiding in simulating wind and demand for estimating BESS energy requirements.</p></details> |  |

The Rise of Skill-Based Hiring for AI and Green Jobs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11942v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated "skill-based hiring" for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In recent years, deep learning enabled anomaly detection has emerged as a critical direction, however the improved detection accuracy is achieved with the utilization of large neural networks, increasing their storage and computational cost. Moreover, the data collected in edge devices contain user privacy, introducing challenges that can be successfully addressed by the privacy-preserving distributed paradigm, known as federated learning (FL). This framework allows edge devices to train and exchange models increasing also the communication cost. Thus, to deal with the increased communication, processing and storage challenges of the FL based deep anomaly detection NN pruning is expected to have significant benefits towards reducing the processing, storage and communication complexity. With this focus, a novel compression-based optimization problem is proposed at the server-side of a FL paradigm that fusses the received local models broadcast and performs pruning generating a more compressed model. Experiments in the context of anomaly detection and missing value imputation demonstrate that the proposed FL scenario along with the proposed compressed-based method are able to achieve high compression rates (more than $99.7\%$) with negligible performance losses (less than $1.18\%$ ) as compared to the centralized solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEXtime: Filterbank learning for explaining time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05841v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for explaining predictions based on time series are built on learning an instance-wise saliency mask for each time step. However, for many types of time series, the salient information is found in the frequency domain. Adopting existing methods to the frequency domain involves naively zeroing out frequency content in the signals, which goes against established signal processing theory. Therefore, we propose a new method entitled FLEXtime, that uses a filterbank to split the time series into frequency bands and learns the optimal combinations of these bands. FLEXtime avoids the drawbacks of zeroing out frequency bins and is more stable and easier to train compared to the naive method. Our extensive evaluation shows that FLEXtime on average outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the time series explainability literature and can provide a valuable tool for a wide range of time series like EEG and audio.</p></details> |  |

Fixing the number of breakpoints to five, our procedure results in breakpoint estimates that closely align with those identified by Westerhold et al. (2020). By treating the number of breakpoints as a parameter to be estimated, we provide the statistical justification for more than five breakpoints in the time series. Further, our approach offers the advantage of constructing confidence intervals for the breakpoints, and it allows for testing the number of breakpoints present in the time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors in alphabetical order</p></details> |
| **[Multiple change-point detection for some point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09103v3)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of change-point detection is to identify behavioral shifts within time series data. This article focuses on scenarios where the data is derived from an inhomogeneous Poisson process or a marked Poisson process. We present a methodology for detecting multiple offline change-points using a minimum contrast estimator. Specifically, we address how to manage the continuous nature of the process given the available discrete observations. Additionally, we select the appropriate number of changes via a cross-validation procedure which is particularly effective given the characteristics of the Poisson process. Lastly, we show how to use this methodology to self-exciting processes with changes in the intensity. Through experiments, with both simulated and real datasets, we showcase the advantages of the proposed method, which has been implemented in the R package \texttt{CptPointProcess}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Dynamic Brain Functional Connectivity Based on Random Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16619v3)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis has been widely applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to reveal time-varying dynamic changes of brain states. The sliding window method is by far the most popular DFC analysis method due to its simplicity. However, the sliding window method comes with some assumptions, namely the typically approach uses a single window which captures dynamics only within a specific frequency range. In this study, we propose a generalized approach to dynamics via a multi-dimensional random convolution (RandCon) DFC method that is able to effectively capture time-varying DFC at arbitrary time scales by extracting different local features from fMRI time series using a number of multi-dimensional random convolution kernels without the need for learning kernel weights. Compared to a standard sliding window method, multiplication of temporal derivatives (MTD) and phase synchrony methods, RandCon with the smallest kernel size (3 time points) showed notable improvements in performance on simulated data, particularly in terms of DFC temporal and spatial estimation in very short window/kernel size under different noise levels. Results from real fMRI data indicated that RandCon was more sensitive to gender differences than competing methods. Furthermore, we show that the sliding window method can be considered a special case of the proposed multi-dimensional convolution framework. The proposed method is simple and efficient significantly broadens the scope of dynamic functional connectivity research and offer theoretical and practical potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Automated Correlated Time Series Forecasting in Minutes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05833v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Societal and industrial infrastructures and systems increasingly leverage sensors that emit correlated time series. Forecasting of future values of such time series based on recorded historical values has important benefits. Automatically designed models achieve higher accuracy than manually designed models. Given a forecasting task, which includes a dataset and a forecasting horizon, automated design methods automatically search for an optimal forecasting model for the task in a manually designed search space, and then train the identified model using the dataset to enable the forecasting. Existing automated methods face three challenges. First, the search space is constructed by human experts, rending the methods only semi-automated and yielding search spaces prone to subjective biases. Second, it is time consuming to search for an optimal model. Third, training the identified model for a new task is also costly. These challenges limit the practicability of automated methods in real-world settings. To contend with the challenges, we propose a fully automated and highly efficient correlated time series forecasting framework where the search and training can be done in minutes. The framework includes a data-driven, iterative strategy to automatically prune a large search space to obtain a high-quality search space for a new forecasting task. It includes a zero-shot search strategy to efficiently identify the optimal model in the customized search space. And it includes a fast parameter adaptation strategy to accelerate the training of the identified model. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets offer evidence that the framework is capable of state-of-the-art accuracy and is much more efficient than existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by PVLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Timer-XL, a generative Transformer for unified time series forecasting. To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem. We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity, multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate generative Transformers on time series, which can effectively capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches) and is further strengthened by position embeddings in both temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. As a large time series model, it demonstrates notable model transferability by large-scale pre-training, as well as contextual flexibility in token lengths, positioning it as a one-for-all forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expectile Periodograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02060v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel periodogram-like function called expectile periodograms, for detecting and estimating hidden periodicities in time series. The expectile periodograms are constructed from trigonometric expectile regression, in which a specially designed objective function is used to substitute the squared $l_2$ norm that leads to the ordinary periodograms. Analogous to quantile periodograms, the expectile periodograms provide a broader view of the time series than the ordinary periodograms by examining different expectile levels, while achieving higher computational efficiency. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the expectile periodograms in the presence of hidden periodicities. Finally, we leverage the inherent two-dimensional characteristics of the expectile periodograms and train a deep-learning (DL) model to classify the earthquake waveform data. Remarkably, our approach achieves higher classification testing accuracy when juxtaposed with alternative periodogram-based methodologies.</p></details> |  |

We use the VIX for consider it observable, and use the Volatility Index: S\&P 500 VIX. This index was designed to measure volatility of S&P 500. We apply it to a different segment: Corporate bond markets. We fit time series models for spreads between corporate and 10-year Treasury bonds. Next, we divide residuals by VIX. Our main idea is such division makes residuals closer to the ideal case of a Gaussian white noise. This is remarkable, since these residuals and VIX come from separate market segments. We also discuss total returns of Bank of America corporate bonds. We conclude with the analysis of long-term behavior of these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 8 graphs.

| **[From Similarity to Superiority: Channel Clustering for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01340v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention in recent decades. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy improves forecasting performance by treating different channels individually, while it leads to poor generalization on unseen instances and ignores potentially necessary interactions between channels. Conversely, the Channel-Dependent (CD) strategy mixes all channels with even irrelevant and indiscriminate information, which, however, results in oversmoothing issues and limits forecasting accuracy. There is a lack of channel strategy that effectively balances individual channel treatment for improved forecasting performance without overlooking essential interactions between channels. Motivated by our observation of a correlation between the time series model's performance boost against channel mixing and the intrinsic similarity on a pair of channels, we developed a novel and adaptable Channel Clustering Module (CCM). CCM dynamically groups channels characterized by intrinsic similarities and leverages cluster information instead of individual channel identities, combining the best of CD and CI worlds. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CCM can (1) boost the performance of CI and CD models by an average margin of 2.4% and 7.2% on long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively; (2) enable zero-shot forecasting with mainstream time series forecasting models; (3) uncover intrinsic time series patterns among channels and improve interpretability of complex time series models.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Formal Logic-guided Robust Federated Learning against Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03231v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to the privacy concerns associated with centralized Machine Learning (ML) by enabling decentralized, collaborative learning. However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats, including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training data or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing this threat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract poisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methods predominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the unique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we present FLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated learning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client data and a large number of adversarial participants. Unlike traditional model-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client trustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns, rather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates. Our approach extracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers global properties, and uses these to verify client updates. Through formal logic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution, identifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the robustness of FL to time series applications. Notably, FLORAL reduced the prediction error by 93.27% in the best-case scenario compared to the second-best baseline.

Deep learning offers an effective solution, capturing complex patterns in time-series traffic flow data to enable the accurate prediction. However, deep learning models are prone to overfitting the intricate details of flow data, leading to poor generalisation. Recent studies suggest that decomposition-based deep ensemble learning methods may address this issue by breaking down a time series into multiple simpler signals, upon which deep learning models are built and ensembled to generate the final prediction. However, few studies have compared the performance of decomposition-based ensemble methods with non-decomposition-based ones which directly utilise raw time-series data. This work compares several decomposition-based and non-decomposition-based deep ensemble learning methods. Experimental results on three traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of decomposition-based ensemble methods, while also revealing their sensitivity to aggregation strategies and forecasting horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by the 2024 Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AJCAI 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for probabilistic interpolation of irregularly sampled time series that we call the Heteroscedastic Temporal Variational Autoencoder (HeTVAE). HeTVAE includes a novel input layer to encode information about input observation sparsity, a temporal VAE architecture to propagate uncertainty due to input sparsity, and a heteroscedastic output layer to enable variable uncertainty in output interpolations. Our results show that the proposed architecture is better able to reflect variable uncertainty through time due to sparse and irregular sampling than a range of baseline and traditional models, as well as recently proposed deep latent variable models that use homoscedastic output layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022</p></details> |

The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>85 pa...</summary><p>85 pages, 2 figures, removed partially linear model section and uploaded as a separate paper (arXiv:2410.22574v1)</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Predictive Models for Healthcare via Rational Logistic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03224v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The healthcare sector has experienced a rapid accumulation of digital data recently, especially in the form of electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs constitute a precious resource that IS researchers could utilize for clinical applications (e.g., morbidity prediction). Deep learning seems like the obvious choice to exploit this surfeit of data. However, numerous studies have shown that deep learning does not enjoy the same kind of success on EHR data as it has in other domains; simple models like logistic regression are frequently as good as sophisticated deep learning ones. Inspired by this observation, we develop a novel model called rational logistic regression (RLR) that has standard logistic regression (LR) as its special case (and thus inherits LR's inductive bias that aligns with EHR data). RLR has rational series as its theoretical underpinnings, works on longitudinal time-series data, and learns interpretable patterns. Empirical comparisons on real-world clinical tasks demonstrate RLR's efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICIS ...</summary><p>ICIS 2021 Proceedings ( see https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2021/is_health/is_health/18 )</p></details> |
| **[FUSE: Fast Unified Simulation and Estimation for PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14558v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint prediction of continuous fields and statistical estimation of the underlying discrete parameters is a common problem for many physical systems, governed by PDEs. Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrendLSW: Trend and Spectral Estimation of Nonstationary Time Series in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05012v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrendLSW R package has been developed to provide users with a suite of wavelet-based techniques to analyse the statistical properties of nonstationary time series. The key components of the package are (a) two approaches for the estimation of the evolutionary wavelet spectrum in the presence of trend; and (b) wavelet-based trend estimation in the presence of locally stationary wavelet errors via both linear and nonlinear wavelet thresholding; and (c) the calculation of associated pointwise confidence intervals. Lastly, the package directly implements boundary handling methods that enable the methods to be performed on data of arbitrary length, not just dyadic length as is common for wavelet-based methods, ensuring no pre-processing of data is necessary. The key functionality of the package is demonstrated through two data examples, arising from biology and activity monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Price Modelling: A Comparative Evaluation of four Generations of Forecasting Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03372v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy is a critical driver of modern economic systems. Accurate energy price forecasting plays an important role in supporting decision-making at various levels, from operational purchasing decisions at individual business organizations to policy-making. A significant body of literature has looked into energy price forecasting, investigating a wide range of methods to improve accuracy and inform these critical decisions. Given the evolving landscape of forecasting techniques, the literature lacks a thorough empirical comparison that systematically contrasts these methods. This paper provides an in-depth review of the evolution of forecasting modeling frameworks, from well-established econometric models to machine learning methods, early sequence learners such LSTMs, and more recent advancements in deep learning with transformer networks, which represent the cutting edge in forecasting. We offer a detailed review of the related literature and categorize forecasting methodologies into four model families. We also explore emerging concepts like pre-training and transfer learning, which have transformed the analysis of unstructured data and hold significant promise for time series forecasting. We address a gap in the literature by performing a comprehensive empirical analysis on these four family models, using data from the EU energy markets, we conduct a large-scale empirical study, which contrasts the forecasting accuracy of different approaches, focusing especially on alternative propositions for time series transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMUDiffusion: A Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Synthetisation for Inertial Motion Capturing Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02954v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinematic sensors are often used to analyze movement behaviors in sports and daily activities due to their ease of use and lack of spatial restrictions, unlike video-based motion capturing systems. Still, the generation, and especially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be time-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited data, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns. To address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the diversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a probabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time series generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time series sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities. Moreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant improvement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In some cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%. IMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity movements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02949v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Our approach imposes a causality constraint on the encoder and decoder networks, ensuring a causal transport from the real market time series to the fake generated time series. Specifically, we prove that the TC-VAE loss provides an upper bound on the causal Wasserstein distance between market distributions and generated distributions. Consequently, the TC-VAE loss controls the discrepancy between optimal values of various dynamic stochastic optimization problems under real and generated distributions. To further enhance the model's ability to approximate the latent representation of the real market distribution, we integrate a RealNVP prior into the TC-VAE framework. Finally, extensive numerical experiments show that TC-VAE achieves promising results on both synthetic and real market data. This is done by comparing real and generated distributions according to various statistical distances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the generated data for downstream financial optimization tasks, as well as showcasing that the generated data reproduces stylized facts of real financial market data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10285v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across various industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management. Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with references, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Mamba Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02941v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot learning, making them well-suited for predicting rapidly evolving patterns in real-world applications where relevant training data are scarce. However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

CSAI extends the current state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation methods by introducing key modifications specifically adapted to EHR data characteristics, namely: a) an attention-based hidden state initialisation technique to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) a domain-informed temporal decay mechanism to adjust the imputation process to clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrate CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural architectures in data restoration and downstream predictive tasks. Additionally, CSAI is integrated within PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.</p></details> |  |

A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF.

This paper presents an enhanced experimental model that integrates a self-attention mechanism with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based autoencoder for the detection of anomalous spectral activities in 5G networks at the waveform level. Our approach, grounded in time-series analysis, processes in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) samples to identify irregularities that could indicate potential jamming attacks. The model's architecture, augmented with a self-attention layer, extends the capabilities of RNN autoencoders, enabling a more nuanced understanding of temporal dependencies and contextual relationships within the RF spectrum. Utilizing a simulated 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) test-bed constructed with srsRAN 5G and Software Defined Radios (SDRs), we generated a comprehensive stream of data that reflects real-world RF spectrum conditions and attack scenarios. The model is trained to reconstruct standard signal behavior, establishing a normative baseline against which deviations, indicative of security threats, are identified. The proposed architecture is designed to balance between detection precision and computational efficiency, so the LSTM network, enriched with self-attention, continues to optimize for minimal execution latency and power consumption. Conducted on a real-world SDR-based testbed, our results demonstrate the model's improved performance and accuracy in threat detection.

In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Our numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and an application to a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing data, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Pre-training with Language Models for Transferable Time Series Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12372v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in self-supervised pre-training (SSL) have significantly advanced the field of learning transferable time series representations, which can be very useful in enhancing the downstream task. Despite being effective, most existing works struggle to achieve cross-domain SSL pre-training, missing valuable opportunities to integrate patterns and features from different domains. The main challenge lies in the significant differences in the characteristics of time-series data across different domains, such as variations in the number of channels and temporal resolution scales. To address this challenge, we propose CrossTimeNet, a novel cross-domain SSL learning framework to learn transferable knowledge from various domains to largely benefit the target downstream task. One of the key characteristics of CrossTimeNet is the newly designed time series tokenization module, which could effectively convert the raw time series into a sequence of discrete tokens based on a reconstruction optimization process. Besides, we highlight that predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens can be very helpful for extracting informative patterns across different domains during SSL pre-training, which has been largely overlooked in past years. Furthermore, unlike previous works, our work treats the pre-training language model (PLM) as the initialization of the encoder network, investigating the feasibility of transferring the knowledge learned by the PLM to the time series area. Through these efforts, the path to cross-domain pre-training of a generic time series model can be effectively paved. We conduct extensive experiments in a real-world scenario across various time series classification domains. The experimental results clearly confirm CrossTimeNet's superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specialized Foundation Models Struggle to Beat Supervised Baselines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02796v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following its success for vision and text, the "foundation model" (FM) paradigm -- pretraining large models on massive data, then fine-tuning on target tasks -- has rapidly expanded to domains in the sciences, engineering, healthcare, and beyond. Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Topological Feature Search Method for Multichannel EEG: Application in ADHD classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06676v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the preliminary diagnosis of ADHD using EEG has attracted the attention from researchers. EEG, known for its expediency and efficiency, plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. However, the non-stationarity of EEG signals and inter-subject variability pose challenges to the diagnostic and classification processes. Topological Data Analysis offers a novel perspective for ADHD classification, diverging from traditional time-frequency domain features. However, conventional TDA models are restricted to single-channel time series and are susceptible to noise, leading to the loss of topological features in persistence diagrams.This paper presents an enhanced TDA approach applicable to multi-channel EEG in ADHD. Initially, optimal input parameters for multi-channel EEG are determined. Subsequently, each channel's EEG undergoes phase space reconstruction (PSR) followed by the utilization of k-Power Distance to Measure for approximating ideal point clouds. Then, multi-dimensional time series are re-embedded, and TDA is applied to obtain topological feature information. Gaussian function-based Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation is employed in the merger persistence diagram to filter out desired topological feature mappings. Finally, the persistence image method is employed to extract topological features, and the influence of various weighting functions on the results is discussed.The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using the IEEE ADHD dataset. Results demonstrate that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach 78.27%, 80.62%, and 75.63%, respectively. Compared to traditional TDA methods, our method was effectively improved and outperforms typical nonlinear descriptors. These findings indicate that our method exhibits higher precision and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SageFormer: Series-Aware Framework for Long-term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01616v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the burgeoning ecosystem of Internet of Things, multivariate time series (MTS) data has become ubiquitous, highlighting the fundamental role of time series forecasting across numerous applications. The crucial challenge of long-term MTS forecasting requires adept models capable of capturing both intra- and inter-series dependencies. Recent advancements in deep learning, notably Transformers, have shown promise. However, many prevailing methods either marginalize inter-series dependencies or overlook them entirely. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel series-aware framework, explicitly designed to emphasize the significance of such dependencies. At the heart of this framework lies our specific implementation: the SageFormer. As a Series-aware Graph-enhanced Transformer model, SageFormer proficiently discerns and models the intricate relationships between series using graph structures. Beyond capturing diverse temporal patterns, it also curtails redundant information across series. Notably, the series-aware framework seamlessly integrates with existing Transformer-based models, enriching their ability to comprehend inter-series relationships. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the superior performance of SageFormer against contemporary state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 11, Issue: 10, 15 May 2024)</p></details> |

While this approach avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time-series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI framework that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million dimensions in the data domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, submitted for a publication</p></details> |

In many of these applications, there is a natural hierarchical structure over the forecasted quantities; and forecasting systems that adhere to this hierarchical structure are said to be coherent. Furthermore, operational planning benefits from accuracy at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. Building accurate and coherent forecasting systems, however, is challenging: classic multivariate time series tools and neural network methods are still being adapted for this purpose. In this paper, we augment an MQForecaster neural network architecture with a novel deep Gaussian factor forecasting model that achieves coherence by construction, yielding a method we call the Deep Coherent Factor Model Neural Network (DeepCoFactor) model. DeepCoFactor generates samples that can be differentiated with respect to the model parameters, allowing optimization on various sample-based learning objectives that align with the forecasting system's goals, including quantile loss and the scaled Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). In a comparison to state-of-the-art coherent forecasting methods, DeepCoFactor achieves significant improvements in scaled CRPS forecast accuracy, with average gains of 15%, as measured on six publicly-available forecasting datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages of main text.

The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, which state that (i) training on less trajectories induces a lower initial state value, (ii) trajectories in a cluster present similar high-level patterns, (iii) distant trajectories influence the decision of an agent, and (iv) humans correctly identify the attributed trajectories to the decision of the agent. We recover the environments used by the authors based on the partial original code they provided for one of the environments (Grid-World), and implemented the remaining from scratch (Seaquest, HalfCheetah, Breakout and Q*Bert). While we confirm that (i), (ii), and (iii) partially hold, we extend on the largely qualitative experiments from the authors by introducing a quantitative metric to further support (iii), and new experiments and visual results for (i). Moreover, we investigate the use of different clustering algorithms and encoder architectures to further support (ii). We could not support (iv), given the limited extent of the original experiments. We conclude that, while some of the claims can be supported, further investigations and experiments could be of interest. We recognise the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness.

This interest necessitates accurate initial orbit determination (IOD) and orbit prediction (OP) in this domain, which faces significant challenges such as severe nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, large state-space volume, and sparse, faint, and unreliable measurements. This paper explores the capability of data-driven Koopman operator-based approximations for OP in these scenarios. Three stable periodic trajectories from distinct cislunar families are analyzed. The analysis includes theoretical justification for using a linear time-invariant system as the data-driven surrogate. This theoretical framework is supported by experimental validation. Furthermore, the accuracy is assessed by comparing the spectral content captured to period estimates derived from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Poincare-like sections.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.13784</p></details> |

Our approach integrates a robustness metric for Linear Temporal Logics (LTL) with the system's motion constraints, ensuring that the resulting trajectories are both optimal and executable. We introduce a cost function that recursively computes the robustness of temporal logic specifications while penalizing time and control effort, striking a balance between path feasibility and logical correctness. We validate our approach with simulations and real-world experiments in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust and practical motion plans. This work represents a significant step towards expanding the applicability of motion planning algorithms to more complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific traffic networks at particular time periods. Consequently, deep learning models trained on one network may struggle to generalize effectively to unseen networks. To address this, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal trajectory prediction framework that performs cross-domain adaption on the attention representation of a Transformer-based model. A graph convolutional network is also integrated to construct dynamic graph feature embeddings that accurately model the complex spatial-temporal interactions between the multi-agent vehicles across multiple traffic domains. The proposed framework is validated on two case studies involving the cross-city and cross-period settings. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves superior trajectory prediction and domain adaptation performances over the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (IEECSMC) 2024</p></details> |

As a first step, we train a backup policy to generate evasive movements from arbitrary initial robot states using model-free reinforcement learning. When learning policies for other tasks, the backup policy can be used to estimate the potential risk of a collision and to offer an alternative action if the estimated risk is considered too high. No matter which action is selected, our action space ensures that the kinematic limits of the robot joints are not violated. We analyze and evaluate two different methods for estimating the risk of a collision. A physics simulation performed in the background is computationally expensive but provides the best results in deterministic environments. If a data-based risk estimator is used instead, the computational effort is significantly reduced, but an additional source of error is introduced. For evaluation, we successfully learn a reaching task and a basketball task while keeping the risk of collisions low. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for deterministic and stochastic environments, including a human-robot scenario and a ball environment, where no state can be considered permanently safe. By conducting experiments with a real robot, we show that our approach can generate safe trajectories in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L); 8 pages; 7 figures</p></details> |

Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories.

One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel \textbf{Optimal Flow Matching} (OFM) approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</p></details> |  |

Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call "controlled" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from large language models, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |

However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Efficient Trajectory Forecasting and Generation with Conditional Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10809v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and generation are crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments. While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. While diffusion models excel in trajectory generation, their iterative sampling process is computationally intensive, hindering robotic systems' dynamic capabilities. We introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel approach using flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient, fast trajectory generation. T-CFM demonstrates effectiveness in adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with 35% higher predictive accuracy and 142% improved planning performance. Crucially, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion models without sacrificing accuracy, enabling real-time decision making in robotics.

| **[Optimal Convex Cover as Collision-free Space Approximation for Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09631v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online iterative algorithm to find an optimal convex cover to under-approximate the free space for autonomous navigation to delineate Safe Flight Corridors (SFC). The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

| **[Efficient and Robust Freeway Traffic Speed Estimation under Oblique Grid using Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05842v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating spatiotemporal traffic states on freeways is a significant challenge due to limited sensor deployment and potential data corruption. In this study, we propose an efficient and robust low-rank model for precise spatiotemporal traffic speed state estimation (TSE) using lowpenetration vehicle trajectory data. Leveraging traffic wave priors, an oblique grid-based matrix is first designed to transform the inherent dependencies of spatiotemporal traffic states into the algebraic low-rankness of a matrix. Then, with the enhanced traffic state low-rankness in the oblique matrix, a low-rank matrix completion method is tailored to explicitly capture spatiotemporal traffic propagation characteristics and precisely reconstruct traffic states. In addition, an anomaly-tolerant module based on a sparse matrix is developed to accommodate corrupted data input and thereby improve the TSE model robustness. Notably, driven by the understanding of traffic waves, the computational complexity of the proposed efficient method is only correlated with the problem size itself, not with dataset size and hyperparameter selection prevalent in existing studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed model. The performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 12% improvement in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the TSE scenarios and an 18% improvement in RMSE in the robust TSE scenarios, and it runs more than 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | accepted by T-ITS |

However, current robotic-assisted physiotherapy methods struggle including biomechanical metrics in their control algorithms, crucial for safe and effective therapy. This paper introduces BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads. The method integrates a high-fidelity musculoskeletal model of the human shoulder into real-time control of robot-patient interaction during rotator cuff tendon rehabilitation. We extract skeletal dynamics and tendon loading information from an OpenSim shoulder model to solve an optimal control problem, generating strain-minimizing trajectories. Trajectories were realized on a healthy subject by an impedance-controlled robot while estimating the state of the subject's shoulder. Target poses were prescribed to design personalized rehabilitation across a wide range of shoulder motion avoiding high-strain areas. BATON was designed with real-time capabilities, enabling continuous trajectory replanning to address unforeseen variations in tendon strain, such as those from changing muscle activation of the subject.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Drawjectory? -- Trajectory Planning using Programming by Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03815v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A flight trajectory defines how exactly a quadrocopter moves in the three-dimensional space from one position to another. Automatic flight trajectory planning faces challenges such as high computational effort and a lack of precision. Hence, when low computational effort or precise control is required, programming the flight route trajectory manually might be preferable. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of how to accurately plan flight trajectories in three-dimensional space. We propose planning quadrocopter flight trajectories manually using the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach -- simply drawing the trajectory in the three-dimensional space by hand. This simplifies the planning process and reduces the level of in-depth knowledge required. We implemented the approach in the context of the Quadcopter Lab at Ulm University. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare the precision and accuracy of the trajectories drawn by a user using our approach as well as the required time with those manually programmed using a domain specific language. The evaluation shows that the Drawjectory workflow is, on average, 78.7 seconds faster without a significant loss of precision, shown by an average deviation 6.67 cm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively.

| **[NEOviz: Uncertainty-Driven Visual Analysis of Asteroid Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02812v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |

Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |

To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

| **[Choice between Partial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities to be determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of human preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

LCGA summarizes similar patterns of change over time into a few distinct categories called trajectory groups, which are then included as "treatments" in the MSM. MSMs are a class of causal models that correctly handle treatment-confounder feedback. The parameters of LCGA-MSMs can be consistently estimated using different estimators, such as inverse probability weighting (IPW), g-computation, and pooled longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (pooled LTMLE). These three estimators of the parameters of LCGA-MSMs are currently implemented in our package. In the context of a time-dependent outcome, we previously proposed a combination of LCGA and history-restricted MSMs (LCGA-HRMSMs). Our package provides additional functions to estimate the parameters of such models.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/modichirag/AtlasSampler</p></details> |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data.

However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |

Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> |  |

Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint</p></details> |

Graph-based machine learning techniques have emerged as promising tools for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection, capturing intricate relationships within money laundering networks. However, the effectiveness of AML solutions is hindered by data silos within financial institutions, limiting collaboration and overall efficacy. This research presents a novel privacy-preserving approach for collaborative AML machine learning, facilitating secure data sharing across institutions and borders while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance. Leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), computations are directly performed on encrypted data, ensuring the confidentiality of financial data. Notably, FHE over the Torus (TFHE) was integrated with graph-based machine learning using Zama Concrete ML. The research contributes two key privacy-preserving pipelines. First, the development of a privacy-preserving Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipeline was explored. Optimization techniques like quantization and pruning were used to render the GNN FHE-compatible. Second, a privacy-preserving graph-based XGBoost pipeline leveraging Graph Feature Preprocessor (GFP) was successfully developed. Experiments demonstrated strong predictive performance, with the XGBoost model consistently achieving over 99% accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall on the balanced AML dataset in both unencrypted and FHE-encrypted inference settings. On the imbalanced dataset, the incorporation of graph-based features improved the F1-score by 8%. The research highlights the need to balance the trade-off between privacy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>14th ...</summary><p>14th International Conference on Security, Privacy, and Applied Cryptographic Engineering (SPACE) 2024</p></details> |

We demonstrate Deep Augmentation through extensive experiments on contrastive learning tasks in NLP, computer vision, and graph learning. We observe substantial performance gains with Transformers, ResNets, and Graph Neural Networks as the underlying models in contrastive learning, but observe inverse effects on the corresponding supervised problems. Our analysis suggests that Deep Augmentation alleviates co-adaptation between layers, a problem exhibited by self-supervised learning where ground truth labels are not available. We use this observation to formulate a method for selecting which layer to target; in particular, our experimentation reveals that targeting deeper layers with Deep Augmentation outperforms augmenting the input data. The simple network- and modality-agnostic nature of this approach enables its integration into various machine learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Air Quality Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for air pollution monitoring has increased in recent years due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, accurately calibrating these sensors in uncontrolled environments remains a significant challenge. While expensive reference sensors can provide accurate ground truth data, they are often deployed on a limited scale due to high costs, leading to a scarcity of labeled data. In diverse urban environments, data distributions constantly shift due to varying factors such as traffic patterns, industrial activities, and weather conditions, which impact sensor readings. Consequently, traditional machine learning models -- despite their increasing deployment for environmental sensor calibration -- often struggle to provide reliable pollutant measurements across different locations due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method specifically tailored for regression tasks on graph-structured data. Our approach leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships between sensors. To effectively capture critical spatial-temporal interactions, we incorporate spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), which extend GNNs by incorporating temporal dynamics. To handle the resulting larger embeddings, we propose a domain adaptation method using a closed-form solution inspired by the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares problem. This method leverages Cholesky decomposition and power iteration to align the subspaces between source and target domains. By aligning these subspaces, our approach allows low-cost IoT sensors to learn calibration parameters from expensive reference sensors. This facilitates reliable pollutant measurements in new locations without the need for additional costly equipment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Graph Condensation with Information Bottleneck Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03911v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation, which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has immediately benefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing graph condensation methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge the gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for federated graph condensation, in which we decouple the typical gradient matching process for graph condensation into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching. In this way, the burdensome computation cost in client-side is largely alleviated. Besides, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during the federated training can be utilized to steal the training data under the membership inference attacks (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the federated graph condensation, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently protect membership privacy during training. Meanwhile, it also achieves comparable and even superior performance against existing centralized graph condensation and federated graph learning methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable evaluation of ionic conductivity through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel point process model for discrete event data over graphs, where the event interaction occurs within a latent graph structure. Our model builds upon Hawkes's classic influence kernel-based formulation in the original self-exciting point processes work to capture the influence of historical events on future events' occurrence. The key idea is to represent the influence kernel by Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture the underlying graph structure while harvesting the strong representation power of GNNs. Compared with prior works focusing on directly modeling the conditional intensity function using neural networks, our kernel presentation herds the repeated event influence patterns more effectively by combining statistical and deep models, achieving better model estimation/learning efficiency and superior predictive performance. Our work significantly extends the existing deep spatio-temporal kernel for point process data, which is inapplicable to our setting due to the fundamental difference in the nature of the observation space being Euclidean rather than a graph. We present comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data to show the superior performance of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art in predicting future events and uncovering the relational structure among data.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRAGA: Prototype-aware Graph Adaptive Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12728v3)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</p></details> |  |

The asserted benefits are improved performance on a variety of graph tasks, node classification and link prediction included. Claims have also been made about the geometric suitability of particular hierarchical graph datasets to representation in hyperbolic space. Despite these claims, our work makes a surprising discovery: when simple Euclidean models with comparable numbers of parameters are properly trained in the same environment, in most cases, they perform as well, if not better, than all introduced hyperbolic graph representation learning models, even on graph datasets previously claimed to be the most hyperbolic as measured by Gromov $\delta$-hyperbolicity (i.e., perfect trees). This observation gives rise to a simple question: how can this be? We answer this question by taking a careful look at the field of hyperbolic graph representation learning as it stands today, and find that a number of papers fail to diligently present baselines, make faulty modelling assumptions when constructing algorithms, and use misleading metrics to quantify geometry of graph datasets. We take a closer look at each of these three problems, elucidate the issues, perform an analysis of methods, and introduce a parametric family of benchmark datasets to ascertain the applicability of (hyperbolic) graph neural networks.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Inductive Graph Few-shot Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06634v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) under a fixed set of labels is well known in contrast to Graph Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (GFSCIL), which involves learning a GNN classifier as graph nodes and classes growing over time sporadically. We introduce inductive GFSCIL that continually learns novel classes with newly emerging nodes while maintaining performance on old classes without accessing previous data. This addresses the practical concern of transductive GFSCIL, which requires storing the entire graph with historical data. Compared to the transductive GFSCIL, the inductive setting exacerbates catastrophic forgetting due to inaccessible previous data during incremental training, in addition to overfitting issue caused by label sparsity. Thus, we propose a novel method, called Topology-based class Augmentation and Prototype calibration (TAP). To be specific, it first creates a triple-branch multi-topology class augmentation method to enhance model generalization ability. As each incremental session receives a disjoint subgraph with nodes of novel classes, the multi-topology class augmentation method helps replicate such a setting in the base session to boost backbone versatility. In incremental learning, given the limited number of novel class samples, we propose an iterative prototype calibration to improve the separation of class prototypes. Furthermore, as backbone fine-tuning poses the feature distribution drift, prototypes of old classes start failing over time, we propose the prototype shift method for old classes to compensate for the drift. We showcase the proposed method on four datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for modelling breast biomechanical compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06596v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breast compression simulation is essential for accurate image registration from 3D modalities to X-ray procedures like mammography. It accounts for tissue shape and position changes due to compression, ensuring precise alignment and improved analysis. Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is reliable for approximating soft tissue deformation, it struggles with balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Recent studies have used data-driven models trained on FEA results to speed up tissue deformation predictions. We propose to explore Physics-based Graph Neural Networks (PhysGNN) for breast compression simulation. PhysGNN has been used for data-driven modelling in other domains, and this work presents the first investigation of their potential in predicting breast deformation during mammographic compression. Unlike conventional data-driven models, PhysGNN, which incorporates mesh structural information and enables inductive learning on unstructured grids, is well-suited for capturing complex breast tissue geometries. Trained on deformations from incremental FEA simulations, PhysGNN's performance is evaluated by comparing predicted nodal displacements with those from finite element (FE) simulations. This deep learning (DL) framework shows promise for accurate, rapid breast deformation approximations, offering enhanced computational efficiency for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Deep ...</summary><p>Deep Breath @ MICCAI 2024 | The code is available at this URL: https://github.com/hadiiiil/GNNs-BreastCompression</p></details> |

However, time-critical decisions in a dynamically changing environment restrict the time available for modelers to gather supporting evidence. As infectious disease dynamics are often heterogeneous on a spatial or demographic scale, models should be resolved accordingly. In addition, with a large number of potential interventions, all scenarios can barely be computed on time, even when using supercomputing facilities. We suggest to combine complex mechanistic models with data-driven surrogate models to allow for on-the-fly model adaptations by public health experts. We build upon a spatially and demographically resolved infectious disease model and train a graph neural network for data sets representing early phases of the pandemic. The resulting networks reached an execution time of less than a second, a significant speedup compared to the metapopulation approach. The suggested approach yields potential for on-the-fly execution and, thus, integration of disease dynamics models in low-barrier website applications. For the approach to be used with decision-making, datasets with larger variance will have to be considered.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Higher Order Structures For Graph Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03253v5)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning representations of graph-structured data, demonstrating remarkable performance across various tasks. Recognising their importance, there has been extensive research focused on explaining GNN predictions, aiming to enhance their interpretability and trustworthiness. However, GNNs and their explainers face a notable challenge: graphs are primarily designed to model pair-wise relationships between nodes, which can make it tough to capture higher-order, multi-node interactions. This characteristic can pose difficulties for existing explainers in fully representing multi-node relationships. To address this gap, we present Framework For Higher-Order Representations In Graph Explanations (FORGE), a framework that enables graph explainers to capture such interactions by incorporating higher-order structures, resulting in more accurate and faithful explanations. Extensive evaluation shows that on average real-world datasets from the GraphXAI benchmark and synthetic datasets across various graph explainers, FORGE improves average explanation accuracy by 1.9x and 2.25x, respectively. We perform ablation studies to confirm the importance of higher-order relations in improving explanations, while our scalability analysis demonstrates FORGE's efficacy on large graphs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing randomized smoothing certificates for GNNs are overly pessimistic since they treat the model as a black box, ignoring the underlying architecture. To remedy this, we propose novel gray-box certificates that exploit the message-passing principle of GNNs: We randomly intercept messages and carefully analyze the probability that messages from adversarially controlled nodes reach their target nodes. Compared to existing certificates, we certify robustness to much stronger adversaries that control entire nodes in the graph and can arbitrarily manipulate node features. Our certificates provide stronger guarantees for attacks at larger distances, as messages from farther-away nodes are more likely to get intercepted. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various models and datasets. Since our gray-box certificates consider the underlying graph structure, we can significantly improve certifiable robustness by applying graph sparsification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2022</p></details> |
| **[Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Node-Splitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06268v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power system networks are often modeled as homogeneous graphs, which limits the ability of graph neural network (GNN) to capture individual generator features at the same nodes. By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream molecular representation learning approaches are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, these approaches struggle with three significant challenges: insufficient annotations, molecular diversity, and architectural limitations such as over-squashing, which leads to the loss of critical structural details. To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of GNNs that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), known for their robust data-fitting capabilities and high accuracy in small-scale AI + Science tasks. By incorporating KANs into GNNs, our model enhances the representation of molecular structures. We further advance this approach with a variant called SwallowKAN (SKAN), which employs adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as the core of the non-linear neurons. This innovation improves both computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse molecular structures. Building on the strengths of SKAN, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-SKAN, and its augmented variant, GNN-SKAN+, which incorporates a SKAN-based classifier to further boost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate KANs into GNN architectures tailored for molecular representation learning. Experiments across 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot learning datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and computational cost.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Generalizing Hyperedge Expansion for Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06191v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By representing knowledge in a primary triple associated with additional attribute-value qualifiers, hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG) that generalizes triple-based knowledge graph (KG) has been attracting research attention recently. Compared with KG, HKG is enriched with the semantic qualifiers as well as the hyper-relational graph structure. However, to model HKG, existing studies mainly focus on either semantic information or structural information therein, which however fail to capture both simultaneously. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we generalize the hyperedge expansion in hypergraph learning and propose an equivalent transformation for HKG modeling, referred to as TransEQ. Specifically, the equivalent transformation transforms a HKG to a KG, which considers both semantic and structural characteristics. Then an encoder-decoder framework is developed to bridge the modeling research between KG and HKG. In the encoder part, KG-based graph neural networks are leveraged for structural modeling; while in the decoder part, various HKG-based scoring functions are exploited for semantic modeling. Especially, we design the sharing embedding mechanism in the encoder-decoder framework with semantic relatedness captured. We further theoretically prove that TransEQ preserves complete information in the equivalent transformation, and also achieves full expressivity. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of TransEQ in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. On the largest benchmark WikiPeople, TransEQ significantly improves the state-of-the-art models by 15\% on MRR.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we delve into the robustness analysis of representative robust GNNs and provide a unified robust estimation point of view to understand their robustness and limitations. Our novel analysis of estimation bias motivates the design of a robust and unbiased graph signal estimator. We then develop an efficient Quasi-Newton Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithm to solve the estimation problem, which is unfolded as robust unbiased aggregation layers in GNNs with theoretical guarantees. Our comprehensive experiments confirm the strong robustness of our proposed model under various scenarios, and the ablation study provides a deep understanding of its advantages.

| **[GFT: Graph Foundation Model with Transferable Tree Vocabulary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06070v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of foundation models in applications such as ChatGPT, as graph data has been ubiquitous, one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) with broader applications in the areas such as scientific research, social network analysis, drug discovery, and e-commerce. Despite the significant progress of pre-trained graph neural networks, there haven't been GFMs that can achieve desired performance on various graph-learning-related tasks. Building GFMs may rely on a vocabulary that encodes transferable patterns shared among different tasks and domains. Unlike image and text, defining such transferable patterns for graphs remains an open question. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by rethinking the transferable patterns on graphs as computation trees -- i.e., tree structures derived from the message-passing process. Based on this insight, we propose a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named GFT, short for Graph Foundation model with transferable Tree vocabulary. By treating computation trees as tokens within the transferable vocabulary, GFT improves model generalization and reduces the risk of negative transfer. The theoretical analyses and extensive experimental studies have demonstrated the transferability of computation trees and shown the effectiveness of GFT across diverse tasks and domains in graph learning.

| **[Topology-aware Reinforcement Feature Space Reconstruction for Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05742v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature space is an environment where data points are vectorized to represent the original dataset. Reconstructing a good feature space is essential to augment the AI power of data, improve model generalization, and increase the availability of downstream ML models. Existing literature, such as feature transformation and feature selection, is labor-intensive (e.g., heavy reliance on empirical experience) and mostly designed for tabular data. Moreover, these methods regard data samples as independent, which ignores the unique topological structure when applied to graph data, thus resulting in a suboptimal reconstruction feature space. Can we consider the topological information to automatically reconstruct feature space for graph data without heavy experiential knowledge? To fill this gap, we leverage topology-aware reinforcement learning to automate and optimize feature space reconstruction for graph data. Our approach combines the extraction of core subgraphs to capture essential structural information with a graph neural network (GNN) to encode topological features and reduce computing complexity. Then we introduce three reinforcement agents within a hierarchical structure to systematically generate meaningful features through an iterative process, effectively reconstructing the feature space. This framework provides a principled solution for attributed graph feature space reconstruction. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of including topological awareness.</p></details> |  |

Despite their versatility, GNNs face challenges such as lack of generalization and poor interpretability, which hinder their wider adoption and reliability in critical applications. Dropping has emerged as an effective paradigm for improving the generalization capabilities of GNNs. However, existing approaches often rely on random or heuristic-based selection criteria, lacking a principled method to identify and exclude nodes that contribute to noise and over-complexity in the model. In this work, we argue that explainability should be a key indicator of a model's quality throughout its training phase. To this end, we introduce xAI-Drop, a novel topological-level dropping regularizer that leverages explainability to pinpoint noisy network elements to be excluded from the GNN propagation mechanism. An empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art dropping approaches in accuracy, and improves explanation quality.</p></details> |  |

During training stage, sampling plays an important role in reducing latency by limiting the number of nodes processed, particularly in large-scale applications. However, as the demand for better prediction performance grows, existing sampling algorithms become increasingly complex, leading to significant overhead. To mitigate this, we propose YOSO (You-Only-Sample-Once), an algorithm designed to achieve efficient training while preserving prediction accuracy. YOSO introduces a compressed sensing (CS)-based sampling and reconstruction framework, where nodes are sampled once at input layer, followed by a lossless reconstruction at the output layer per epoch. By integrating the reconstruction process with the loss function of specific learning tasks, YOSO not only avoids costly computations in traditional compressed sensing (CS) methods, such as orthonormal basis calculations, but also ensures high-probability accuracy retention which equivalent to full node participation. Experimental results on node classification and link prediction demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of YOSO, reducing GNN training by an average of 75\% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with top-performing baselines.</p></details> |  |

In temporal data, static path-based centralities like closeness or betweenness can give misleading results about the true importance of nodes in a temporal graph. To address this issue, temporal generalizations of betweenness and closeness have been defined that are based on the shortest time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. However, a major issue of those generalizations is that the calculation of such paths is computationally expensive. Addressing this issue, we study the application of De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNN), a time-aware graph neural network architecture, to predict temporal path-based centralities in time series data. We experimentally evaluate our approach in 13 temporal graphs from biological and social systems and show that it considerably improves the prediction of betweenness and closeness centrality compared to (i) a static Graph Convolutional Neural Network, (ii) an efficient sampling-based approximation technique for temporal betweenness, and (iii) two state-of-the-art time-aware graph learning techniques for dynamic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This requirement gains further importance in real-world scenarios where robots operate in coexistence with humans. In these complex environments, human actions inevitably lead to changes, requiring robots to adapt accordingly. To effectively address these dynamics, the concept of continual learning proves essential. It not only enables learning models to integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information but also facilitates the acquisition of insights from diverse contexts. This aspect is particularly relevant to the issue of context-switching, where robots must navigate and adapt to changing situational dynamics. Our approach introduces a novel approach to effectively tackle the problem of context drifts by designing a Streaming Graph Neural Network that incorporates both regularization and rehearsal techniques. Our Continual\_GTM model enables us to retain previous knowledge from different contexts, and it is more effective than traditional fine-tuning approaches. We evaluated the efficacy of Continual\_GTM in predicting human routines within household environments, leveraging spatio-temporal object dynamics across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This strong convergence phenomenon applies to a very wide class of GNNs, including state of the art models, with aggregates including mean and the attention-based mechanism of graph transformers. Our results apply to a broad class of random graph models, including sparse and dense variants of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, the stochastic block model, and the Barab\'asi-Albert model.

In these hidden communities, malicious actors collaborate to exchange illicit knowledge, tools, and tactics, driving a range of cyber threats from hacking techniques to the sale of stolen data, malware, and zero-day exploits. Identifying the key instigators (i.e., key hackers), behind these operations is essential but remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel method called EUREKHA (Enhancing User Representation for Key Hacker Identification in Underground Forums), designed to identify these key hackers by modeling each user as a textual sequence. This sequence is processed through a large language model (LLM) for domain-specific adaptation, with LLMs acting as feature extractors. These extracted features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model user structural relationships, significantly improving identification accuracy. Furthermore, we employ BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Topic Modeling) to extract personalized topics from user-generated content, enabling multiple textual representations per user and optimizing the selection of the most representative sequence. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying key hackers. Additionally, when combined with GNNs, our model achieves significant improvements, resulting in approximately 6% and 10% increases in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over existing methods. EUREKHA was tested on the Hack-Forums dataset, and we provide open-source access to our code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Trustcom 2024</p></details> |

To this end, we propose pseudometrics over the space of all attributed graphs that describe the fine-grained expressivity of GNNs. Namely, GNNs are both Lipschitz continuous with respect to our pseudometrics and can separate attributed graphs that are distant in the metric. Moreover, we prove that the space of all attributed graphs is relatively compact with respect to our metrics. Based on these properties, we prove a universal approximation theorem for GNNs and generalization bounds for GNNs on any data distribution of attributed graphs. The proposed metrics compute the similarity between the structures of attributed graphs via a hierarchical optimal transport between computation trees. Our work extends and unites previous approaches which either derived theory only for graphs with no attributes, derived compact metrics under which GNNs are continuous but without separation power, or derived metrics under which GNNs are continuous and separate points but the space of graphs is not relatively compact, which prevents universal approximation and generalization analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing GNN explanation methods often yield technical outputs such as subgraphs and feature importance scores, which are not easily understood. Building on recent insights from social science and other Explainable AI (XAI) methods, we propose GraphXAIN, a natural language narrative that explains individual predictions made by GNNs. We present a model-agnostic and explainer-agnostic XAI approach that complements graph explainers by generating GraphXAINs, using Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating graph data, individual predictions from GNNs, explanatory subgraphs, and feature importances. We define XAI Narratives and XAI Descriptions, highlighting their distinctions and emphasizing the importance of narrative principles in effective explanations. By incorporating natural language narratives, our approach supports graph practitioners and non-expert users, aligning with social science research on explainability and enhancing user understanding and trust in complex GNN models. We demonstrate GraphXAIN's capabilities on a real-world graph dataset, illustrating how its generated narratives can aid understanding compared to traditional graph explainer outputs or other descriptive explanation methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

In this context, this study introduces RobustCRF, a post-hoc approach aiming to enhance the robustness of GNNs at the inference stage. Our proposed method, founded on statistical relational learning using a Conditional Random Field, is model-agnostic and does not require prior knowledge about the underlying model architecture.

Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that utilize integer-order or single fractional-order differential equations, DRAGON uses a learnable probability distribution over a range of real numbers for the derivative orders. By allowing a flexible and learnable superposition of multiple derivative orders, our framework captures complex graph feature updating dynamics beyond the reach of conventional models. We provide a comprehensive interpretation of our framework's capability to capture intricate dynamics through the lens of a non-Markovian graph random walk with node feature updating driven by an anomalous diffusion process over the graph. Furthermore, to highlight the versatility of the DRAGON framework, we conduct empirical evaluations across a range of graph learning tasks. The results consistently demonstrate superior performance when compared to traditional continuous GNN models.

| **[AsEP: Benchmarking Deep Learning Methods for Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18184v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epitope identification is vital for antibody design yet challenging due to the inherent variability in antibodies. While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question. The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity. We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction). AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods and evaluate their generalisability. AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods. Using this new dataset, we benchmark several representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances fall short of expectations for epitope prediction. To address this, we propose a novel method, WALLE, which leverages both unstructured modeling from protein language models and structural modeling from graph neural networks. WALLE demonstrate up to 3-10X performance improvement over the baseline methods. Our empirical findings suggest that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential features provided by language models with geometrical information from graph representations. This provides a guideline for future epitope prediction method design. In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing convenient model performance attribution and interpretability. We open source our data and code at https://github.com/biochunan/AsEP-dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Manifold Perspective on the Statistical Generalization of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05225v4)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend convolutional neural networks to operate on graphs. Despite their impressive performances in various graph learning tasks, the theoretical understanding of their generalization capability is still lacking. Previous GNN generalization bounds ignore the underlying graph structures, often leading to bounds that increase with the number of nodes -- a behavior contrary to the one experienced in practice. In this paper, we take a manifold perspective to establish the statistical generalization theory of GNNs on graphs sampled from a manifold in the spectral domain. As demonstrated empirically, we prove that the generalization bounds of GNNs decrease linearly with the size of the graphs in the logarithmic scale, and increase linearly with the spectral continuity constants of the filter functions. Notably, our theory explains both node-level and graph-level tasks. Our result has two implications: i) guaranteeing the generalization of GNNs to unseen data over manifolds; ii) providing insights into the practical design of GNNs, i.e., restrictions on the discriminability of GNNs are necessary to obtain a better generalization performance. We demonstrate our generalization bounds of GNNs using synthetic and multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages,25 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting the Structure of Two Graphs with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05119v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising solution to deal with unstructured data, outperforming traditional deep learning architectures. However, most of the current GNN models are designed to work with a single graph, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios where multiple graphs may be involved. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph-based deep learning architecture to handle tasks where two sets of signals exist, each defined on a different graph. First we consider the setting where the input is represented as a signal on top of one graph (input graph) and the output is a graph signal defined over a different graph (output graph). For this setup, we propose a three-block architecture where we first process the input data using a GNN that operates over the input graph, then apply a transformation function that operates in a latent space and maps the signals from the input to the output graph, and finally implement a second GNN that operates over the output graph. Our goal is not to propose a single specific definition for each of the three blocks, but rather to provide a flexible approach to solve tasks involving data defined on two graphs. The second part of the paper addresses a self-supervised setup, where the focus is not on the output space but on the underlying latent space and, inspired by Canonical Correlation Analysis, we seek informative representations of the data that can be leveraged to solve a downstream task. By leveraging information from multiple graphs, the proposed architecture can capture more intricate relationships between different entities in the data. We test this in several experimental setups using synthetic and real world datasets, and observe that the proposed architecture works better than traditional deep learning architectures, showcasing the importance of leveraging the information of the two graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Missing Data Imputation through Combined Bipartite Graph and Complete Directed Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04907v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to address a significant challenge in the field of missing data imputation: identifying and leveraging the interdependencies among features to enhance missing data imputation for tabular data. We introduce a novel framework named the Bipartite and Complete Directed Graph Neural Network (BCGNN). Within BCGNN, observations and features are differentiated as two distinct node types, and the values of observed features are converted into attributed edges linking them. The bipartite segment of our framework inductively learns embedding representations for nodes, efficiently utilizing the comprehensive information encapsulated in the attributed edges. In parallel, the complete directed graph segment adeptly outlines and communicates the complex interdependencies among features. When compared to contemporary leading imputation methodologies, BCGNN consistently outperforms them, achieving a noteworthy average reduction of 15% in mean absolute error for feature imputation tasks under different missing mechanisms. Our extensive experimental investigation confirms that an in-depth grasp of the interdependence structure substantially enhances the model's feature embedding ability. We also highlight the model's superior performance in label prediction tasks involving missing data, and its formidable ability to generalize to unseen data points.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional methods, which often require extensive preprocessing to handle irregular or inconsistent missing data, our approach accommodates arbitrary missing data patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. SHT-GNN models both observations and covariates as distinct node types, connecting observation nodes at successive time points through subject-specific longitudinal subnetworks, while covariate-observation interactions are represented by attributed edges within bipartite graphs. By leveraging subject-wise mini-batch sampling and a multi-layer temporal smoothing mechanism, SHT-GNN efficiently scales to large datasets, while effectively learning node representations and imputing missing data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, demonstrate that SHT-GNN significantly outperforms existing imputation methods, even with high missing data rates. The empirical results highlight SHT-GNN's robust imputation capabilities and superior performance, particularly in the context of complex, large-scale longitudinal data.</p></details> |  |

Traditional GSOs are typically constructed by normalizing the adjacency matrix by the degree matrix, a local centrality metric. In this work, we instead propose and study Centrality GSOs (CGSOs), which normalize adjacency matrices by global centrality metrics such as the PageRank, $k$-core or count of fixed length walks. We study spectral properties of the CGSOs, allowing us to get an understanding of their action on graph signals. We confirm this understanding by defining and running the spectral clustering algorithm based on different CGSOs on several synthetic and real-world datasets. We furthermore outline how our CGSO can act as the message passing operator in any Graph Neural Network and in particular demonstrate strong performance of a variant of the Graph Convolutional Network and Graph Attention Network using our CGSOs on several real-world benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that it has higher accuracy than standard neural networks and convolutional neural networks that treat the coordinates as features. Encouraged by the speed-up in model accuracy by the GeogGNN model, we provide a general mathematical result that demonstrates that a geometrically weighted neural network will, in principle, always display higher accuracy in the classification of spatially dependent data by making use of spatial continuity and local averaging features.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to the International Jordanian Cybersecurity Conference 2024 (IJCC24)</p></details> |

Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art (SOTA) feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while inference speed improves between 4x and 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our benchmark datasets. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have primarily attempted to utilize the information from higher-order neighbors in the graph, involving the incorporation of powers of the shift operator, such as the graph Laplacian or adjacency matrix. This approach comes with a trade-off in terms of increased computational and memory demands. Relying on graph spectral theory, we make a fundamental observation: the regular and the Hadamard power of the Laplacian matrix behave similarly in the spectrum. This observation has significant implications for capturing higher-order information in GNNs for various tasks such as node classification and semi-supervised learning. Consequently, we propose a novel graph convolutional operator based on the sparse Sobolev norm of graph signals. Our approach, known as Sparse Sobolev GNN (S2-GNN), employs Hadamard products between matrices to maintain the sparsity level in graph representations. S2-GNN utilizes a cascade of filters with increasing Hadamard powers to generate a diverse set of functions. We theoretically analyze the stability of S2-GNN to show the robustness of the model against possible graph perturbations. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation of S2-GNN across various graph mining, semi-supervised node classification, and computer vision tasks. In particular use cases, our algorithm demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of performance and running time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Performance Issues in Cloud Service Systems Based on Relational-Temporal Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10869v3)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud systems are susceptible to performance issues, which may cause service-level agreement violations and financial losses. In current practice, crucial metrics are monitored periodically to provide insight into the operational status of components. Identifying performance issues is often formulated as an anomaly detection problem, which is tackled by analyzing each metric independently. However, this approach overlooks the complex dependencies existing among cloud components. Some graph neural network-based methods take both temporal and relational information into account, however, the correlation violations in the metrics that serve as indicators of underlying performance issues are difficult for them to identify. Furthermore, a large volume of components in a cloud system results in a vast array of noisy metrics. This complexity renders it impractical for engineers to fully comprehend the correlations, making it challenging to identify performance issues accurately. To address these limitations, we propose Identifying Performance Issues based on Relational-Temporal Features (ISOLATE ), a learning-based approach that leverages both the relational and temporal features of metrics to identify performance issues. In particular, it adopts a graph neural network with attention to characterizing the relations among metrics and extracts long-term and multi-scale temporal patterns using a GRU and a convolution network, respectively. The learned graph attention weights can be further used to localize the correlation-violated metrics. Moreover, to relieve the impact of noisy data, ISOLATE utilizes a positive unlabeled learning strategy that tags pseudo-labels based on a small portion of confirmed negative examples. Extensive evaluation on both public and industrial datasets shows that ISOLATE outperforms all baseline models with 0.945 F1-score and 0.920 Hit rate@3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of CGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12452v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have proven efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

Fraudsters continually seek new and innovative ways to circumvent the detection algorithms in place. Traditionally, fraud detection relied on rule-based methods, where rules were manually created based on transaction data features. However, these techniques soon became ineffective due to their reliance on manual rule creation and their inability to detect complex data patterns. Today, a significant portion of the financial services sector employs various machine learning algorithms, such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and neural networks, to model transaction data. While these techniques have proven more efficient than rule-based methods, they still fail to capture interactions between different transactions and their interrelationships. Recently, graph-based techniques have been adopted for financial fraud detection, leveraging graph topology to aggregate neighborhood information of transaction data using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite showing improvements over previous methods, these techniques still struggle to keep pace with the evolving camouflaging tactics of fraudsters and suffer from information loss due to over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that employs an efficient neighborhood sampling method, effective for camouflage detection and preserving crucial feature information from non-similar nodes. Additionally, we introduce a novel GNN architecture that utilizes attention mechanisms and preserves holistic neighborhood information to prevent information loss. We test our algorithm on financial data to show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications 2024</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.</p></details> |  |

Most works of GNNs assume that the observed structure accurately represents the underlying node relationships. However, the graph structure is inevitably noisy or incomplete in reality, which can degrade the quality of graph representations. Therefore, it is imperative to learn a clean graph structure that balances performance and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel method named \textit{Global-augmented Graph Structure Learning} (GaGSL), guided by the Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle. The key idea behind GaGSL is to learn a compact and informative graph structure for node classification tasks. Specifically, to mitigate the bias caused by relying solely on the original structure, we first obtain augmented features and augmented structure through global feature augmentation and global structure augmentation. We then input the augmented features and augmented structure into a structure estimator with different parameters for optimization and re-definition of the graph structure, respectively. The redefined structures are combined to form the final graph structure. Finally, we employ GIB based on mutual information to guide the optimization of the graph structure to obtain the minimum sufficient graph structure. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of datasets reveal the outstanding performance and robustness of GaGSL compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) setup on the back of a high-impact problem. The accumulation and yearly growth of plastic in the ocean cause irreparable damage to many aspects of oceanic health and the marina system. To prevent further damage, we need to find ways to reduce macroplastics from known plastic patches in the ocean. Here we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based communication mechanism that increases the agents' observation space. In our custom environment, agents control a plastic collecting vessel. The communication mechanism enables agents to develop a communication protocol using a binary signal. While the goal of the agent collective is to clean up as much as possible, agents are rewarded for the individual amount of macroplastics collected. Hence agents have to learn to communicate effectively while maintaining high individual performance. We compare our proposed communication mechanism with a multi-agent baseline without the ability to communicate. Results show communication enables collaboration and increases collective performance significantly. This means agents have learned the importance of communication and found a balance between collaboration and competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tackl...</summary><p>Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at the 11th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023)</p></details> |

They are built from layers of graph convolutions which serve as a powerful inductive bias for describing the flow of information among the vertices. Often, more than one data modality is available. This work considers a setting in which several graphs have the same vertex set and a common vertex-level learning task. This generalizes standard GNN models to GNNs with several graph operators that do not commute. We may call this model graph-tuple neural networks (GtNN). In this work, we develop the mathematical theory to address the stability and transferability of GtNNs using properties of non-commuting non-expansive operators. We develop a limit theory of graphon-tuple neural networks and use it to prove a universal transferability theorem that guarantees that all graph-tuple neural networks are transferable on convergent graph-tuple sequences. In particular, there is no non-transferable energy under the convergence we consider here. Our theoretical results extend well-known transferability theorems for GNNs to the case of several simultaneous graphs (GtNNs) and provide a strict improvement on what is currently known even in the GNN case. We illustrate our theoretical results with simple experiments on synthetic and real-world data. To this end, we derive a training procedure that provably enforces the stability of the resulting model.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have remarkable performance in graph representation learning, their extension to hypergraphs encounters challenges due to their intricate structures. Furthermore, current hypergraph transformers, a special variant of GNN, utilize semantic feature-based self-attention, ignoring topological attributes of nodes and hyperedges. To address these challenges, we propose a Topology-guided Hypergraph Transformer Network (THTN). In this model, we first formulate a hypergraph from a graph while retaining its structural essence to learn higher-order relations within the graph. Then, we design a simple yet effective structural and spatial encoding module to incorporate the topological and spatial information of the nodes into their representation. Further, we present a structure-aware self-attention mechanism that discovers the important nodes and hyperedges from both semantic and structural viewpoints. By leveraging these two modules, THTN crafts an improved node representation, capturing both local and global topological expressions. Extensive experiments conducted on node classification tasks demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model consistently exceeds that of the existing approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show promise for researchers in solving CO problems. This study investigates the effectiveness of GNNs in solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, inspired by the intriguing findings of Schuetz et al., and aimed to enhance this solver. Despite the promise shown by GNNs, some researchers observed discrepancies when reproducing the findings, particularly compared to the greedy algorithm, for instance. We reproduced Schuetz' Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) unsupervised approach and explored the possibility of combining it with a supervised learning approach for solving MIS problems. While the QUBO unsupervised approach did not guarantee maximal or optimal solutions, it provided a solid first guess for post-processing techniques like greedy decoding or tree-based methods. Moreover, our findings indicated that the supervised approach could further refine the QUBO unsupervised solver, as the learned model assigned meaningful probabilities for each node as initial node features, which could then be improved with the QUBO unsupervised approach. Thus, GNNs offer a valuable method for solving CO problems by integrating learned graph structures rather than relying solely on traditional heuristic functions. This research highlights the potential of GNNs to boost solver performance by leveraging ground truth during training and using optimization functions to learn structural graph information, marking a pioneering step towards improving prediction accuracy in a non-autoregressive manner.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, labels on nodes of graphs are inevitably noisy and sparsely labeled, significantly degrading the performance of GNNs. Exploring robust GNNs for semi-supervised node classification in the presence of noisy and sparse labels remains a critical challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}eural \textbf{N}etwork with \textbf{C}oarse- and \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{G}rained \textbf{D}ivision for mitigating label sparsity and noise, namely GNN-CFGD. The key idea of GNN-CFGD is reducing the negative impact of noisy labels via coarse- and fine-grained division, along with graph reconstruction. Specifically, we first investigate the effectiveness of linking unlabeled nodes to cleanly labeled nodes, demonstrating that this approach is more effective in combating labeling noise than linking to potentially noisy labeled nodes. Based on this observation, we introduce a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based on the memory effect to perform a coarse-grained division of the given labels into clean and noisy labels. Next, we propose a clean labels oriented link that connects unlabeled nodes to cleanly labeled nodes, aimed at mitigating label sparsity and promoting supervision propagation. Furthermore, to provide refined supervision for noisy labeled nodes and additional supervision for unlabeled nodes, we fine-grain the noisy labeled and unlabeled nodes into two candidate sets based on confidence, respectively. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of GNN-CFGD.</p></details> |  |

An Efficient Risk Assessment Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03663v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their diverse applications. However, the scarcity and quality limitations of graph data present challenges to their training process in practical settings. To facilitate the development of effective GNNs, companies and researchers often seek external collaboration. Yet, directly sharing data raises privacy concerns, motivating data owners to train GNNs on their private graphs and share the trained models. Unfortunately, these models may still inadvertently disclose sensitive properties of their training graphs (e.g., average default rate in a transaction network), leading to severe consequences for data owners. In this work, we study graph property inference attack to identify the risk of sensitive property information leakage from shared models. Existing approaches typically train numerous shadow models for developing such attack, which is computationally intensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose an efficient graph property inference attack by leveraging model approximation techniques. Our method only requires training a small set of models on graphs, while generating a sufficient number of approximated shadow models for attacks. To enhance diversity while reducing errors in the approximated models, we apply edit distance to quantify the diversity within a group of approximated models and introduce a theoretically guaranteed criterion to evaluate each model's error. Subsequently, we propose a novel selection mechanism to ensure that the retained approximated models achieve high diversity and low error. Extensive experiments across six real-world scenarios demonstrate our method's substantial improvement, with average increases of 2.7% in attack accuracy and 4.1% in ROC-AUC, while being 6.5$\times$ faster compared to the best baseline.</p></details> | In NeurIPS'24 |
| **[SEGMN: A Structure-Enhanced Graph Matching Network for Graph Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03624v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph similarity computation (GSC) aims to quantify the similarity score between two graphs. Although recent GSC methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) take advantage of intra-graph structures in message passing, few of them fully utilize the structures presented by edges to boost the representation of their connected nodes. Moreover, previous cross-graph node embedding matching lacks the perception of the overall structure of the graph pair, due to the fact that the node representations from GNNs are confined to the intra-graph structure, causing the unreasonable similarity score. Intuitively, the cross-graph structure represented in the assignment graph is helpful to rectify the inappropriate matching. Therefore, we propose a structure-enhanced graph matching network (SEGMN). Equipped with a dual embedding learning module and a structure perception matching module, SEGMN achieves structure enhancement in both embedding learning and cross-graph matching. The dual embedding learning module incorporates adjacent edge representation into each node to achieve a structure-enhanced representation. The structure perception matching module achieves cross-graph structure enhancement through assignment graph convolution. The similarity score of each cross-graph node pair can be rectified by aggregating messages from structurally relevant node pairs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEGMN outperforms the state-of-the-art GSC methods in the GED regression task, and the structure perception matching module is plug-and-play, which can further improve the performance of the baselines by up to 25%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced RAG Models with Graph Structures: Optimizing Complex Knowledge Reasoning and Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03572v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to optimize the existing retrieval-augmented generation model (RAG) by introducing a graph structure to improve the performance of the model in dealing with complex knowledge reasoning tasks. The traditional RAG model has the problem of insufficient processing efficiency when facing complex graph structure information (such as knowledge graphs, hierarchical relationships, etc.), which affects the quality and consistency of the generated results. This study proposes a scheme to process graph structure data by combining graph neural network (GNN), so that the model can capture the complex relationship between entities, thereby improving the knowledge consistency and reasoning ability of the generated text. The experiment used the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset and compared it with multiple existing generation models. The results show that the graph-based RAG model proposed in this paper is superior to the traditional generation model in terms of quality, knowledge consistency, and reasoning ability, especially when dealing with tasks that require multi-dimensional reasoning. Through the combination of the enhancement of the retrieval module and the graph neural network, the model in this study can better handle complex knowledge background information and has broad potential value in multiple practical application scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[DFA-GNN: Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks by Direct Feedback Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02040v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are recognized for their strong performance across various applications, with the backpropagation algorithm playing a central role in the development of most GNN models. However, despite its effectiveness, BP has limitations that challenge its biological plausibility and affect the efficiency, scalability and parallelism of training neural networks for graph-based tasks. While several non-BP training algorithms, such as the direct feedback alignment, have been successfully applied to fully-connected and convolutional network components for handling Euclidean data, directly adapting these non-BP frameworks to manage non-Euclidean graph data in GNN models presents significant challenges. These challenges primarily arise from the violation of the i.i.d. assumption in graph data and the difficulty in accessing prediction errors for all samples (nodes) within the graph. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper we propose DFA-GNN, a novel forward learning framework tailored for GNNs with a case study of semi-supervised learning. The proposed method breaks the limitations of BP by using a dedicated forward training mechanism. Specifically, DFA-GNN extends the principles of DFA to adapt to graph data and unique architecture of GNNs, which incorporates the information of graph topology into the feedback links to accommodate the non-Euclidean characteristics of graph data. Additionally, for semi-supervised graph learning tasks, we developed a pseudo error generator that spreads residual errors from training data to create a pseudo error for each unlabeled node. These pseudo errors are then utilized to train GNNs using DFA. Extensive experiments on 10 public benchmarks reveal that our learning framework outperforms not only previous non-BP methods but also the standard BP methods, and it exhibits excellent robustness against various types of noise and attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DA-MoE: Addressing Depth-Sensitivity in Graph-Level Analysis through Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03025v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are gaining popularity for processing graph-structured data. In real-world scenarios, graph data within the same dataset can vary significantly in scale. This variability leads to depth-sensitivity, where the optimal depth of GNN layers depends on the scale of the graph data. Empirically, fewer layers are sufficient for message passing in smaller graphs, while larger graphs typically require deeper networks to capture long-range dependencies and global features. However, existing methods generally use a fixed number of GNN layers to generate representations for all graphs, overlooking the depth-sensitivity issue in graph structure data. To address this challenge, we propose the depth adaptive mixture of expert (DA-MoE) method, which incorporates two main improvements to GNN backbone: \textbf{1)} DA-MoE employs different GNN layers, each considered an expert with its own parameters. Such a design allows the model to flexibly aggregate information at different scales, effectively addressing the depth-sensitivity issue in graph data. \textbf{2)} DA-MoE utilizes GNN to capture the structural information instead of the linear projections in the gating network. Thus, the gating network enables the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data. By leveraging these improvements, each expert in DA-MoE specifically learns distinct graph patterns at different scales. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on the TU dataset and open graph benchmark (OGB) have shown that DA-MoE consistently surpasses existing baselines on various tasks, including graph, node, and link-level analyses. The code are available at \url{https://github.com/Celin-Yao/DA-MoE}.</p></details> | 8pages |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing regional differences, they encounter challenges when dealing with complex, high-density graph structures. In this work, we consider the cortical surface mesh as a sparse graph and propose an interpretable prediction model-Surface Graph Neural Network (SurfGNN). SurfGNN employs topology-sampling learning (TSL) and region-specific learning (RSL) structures to manage individual cortical features at both lower and higher scales of the surface mesh, effectively tackling the challenges posed by the overly abundant mesh nodes and addressing the issue of heterogeneity in cortical regions. Building on this, a novel score-weighted fusion (SWF) method is implemented to merge nodal representations associated with each cortical feature for prediction. We apply our model to a neonatal brain age prediction task using a dataset of harmonized MR images from 481 subjects (503 scans). SurfGNN outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating an improvement of at least 9.0% and achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.827+0.056 in postmenstrual weeks. Furthermore, it generates feature-level activation maps, indicating its capability to identify robust regional variations in different morphometric contributions for prediction.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Different from centralized schemes, which gather all the channel state information (CSI) at the central processing unit (CPU) for calculating the resource allocation, the local resource of access points (APs) is exploited in the proposed distributed GNN-based framework to allocate transmit powers. Specifically, APs can use a unique GNN model to allocate their power based on the local CSI. The GNN model is trained at the CPU using the local CSI of one AP, with partially exchanged information from other APs to calculate the loss function to reflect system characteristics, capturing comprehensive network information while avoiding computation burden. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed learning-based approach achieves a sum ergodic rate close to that of centralized learning while outperforming the model-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, and 4 tables.

| **[Predicting the Temperature-Dependent CMC of Surfactant Mixtures with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02224v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surfactants are key ingredients in foaming and cleansing products across various industries such as personal and home care, industrial cleaning, and more, with the critical micelle concentration (CMC) being of major interest. Predictive models for CMC of pure surfactants have been developed based on recent ML methods, however, in practice surfactant mixtures are typically used due to to performance, environmental, and cost reasons. This requires accounting for synergistic/antagonistic interactions between surfactants; however, predictive ML models for a wide spectrum of mixtures are missing so far. Herein, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) framework for surfactant mixtures to predict the temperature-dependent CMC. We collect data for 108 surfactant binary mixtures, to which we add data for pure species from our previous work [Brozos et al. (2024), J. Chem. Theory Comput.]. We then develop and train GNNs and evaluate their accuracy across different prediction test scenarios for binary mixtures relevant to practical applications. The final GNN models demonstrate very high predictive performance when interpolating between different mixture compositions and for new binary mixtures with known species. Extrapolation to binary surfactant mixtures where either one or both surfactant species are not seen before, yields accurate results for the majority of surfactant systems. We further find superior accuracy of the GNN over a semi-empirical model based on activity coefficients, which has been widely used to date. We then explore if GNN models trained solely on binary mixture and pure species data can also accurately predict the CMCs of ternary mixtures. Finally, we experimentally measure the CMC of 4 commercial surfactants that contain up to four species and industrial relevant mixtures and find a very good agreement between measured and predicted CMC values.</p></details> |  |
| **[DM4Steal: Diffusion Model For Link Stealing Attack On Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03364v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph has become increasingly integral to the advancement of recommendation systems, particularly with the fast development of graph neural network(GNN). By exploring the virtue of rich node features and link information, GNN is designed to provide personalized and accurate suggestions. Meanwhile, the privacy leakage of GNN in such contexts has also captured special attention. Prior work has revealed that a malicious user can utilize auxiliary knowledge to extract sensitive link data of the target graph, integral to recommendation systems, via the decision made by the target GNN model. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of data used in recommendation system. Though important, previous works on GNN's privacy leakage are still challenged in three aspects, i.e., limited stealing attack scenarios, sub-optimal attack performance, and adaptation against defense. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion model based link stealing attack, named DM4Steal. It differs previous work from three critical aspects. (i) Generality: aiming at six attack scenarios with limited auxiliary knowledge, we propose a novel training strategy for diffusion models so that DM4Steal is transferable to diverse attack scenarios. (ii) Effectiveness: benefiting from the retention of semantic structure in the diffusion model during the training process, DM4Steal is capable to learn the precise topology of the target graph through the GNN decision process. (iii) Adaptation: when GNN is defensive (e.g., DP, Dropout), DM4Steal relies on the stability that comes from sampling the score model multiple times to keep performance degradation to a minimum, thus DM4Steal implements successful adaptive attack on defensive GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Efficient Adversarial Attack Against Vertical Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02809v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) has captured wide attention due to its capability of graph representation learning for graph-structured data. However, the distributed data silos limit the performance of GNN. Vertical federated learning (VFL), an emerging technique to process distributed data, successfully makes GNN possible to handle the distributed graph-structured data. Despite the prosperous development of vertical federated graph learning (VFGL), the robustness of VFGL against the adversarial attack has not been explored yet. Although numerous adversarial attacks against centralized GNNs are proposed, their attack performance is challenged in the VFGL scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the adversarial attack against VFGL. A query-efficient hybrid adversarial attack framework is proposed to significantly improve the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, denoted as NA2, short for Neuron-based Adversarial Attack. Specifically, a malicious client manipulates its local training data to improve its contribution in a stealthy fashion. Then a shadow model is established based on the manipulated data to simulate the behavior of the server model in VFGL. As a result, the shadow model can improve the attack success rate of various centralized attacks with a few queries. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks demonstrate that NA2 improves the performance of the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, achieving state-of-the-art performance even under potential adaptive defense where the defender knows the attack method. Additionally, we provide interpretable experiments of the effectiveness of NA2 via sensitive neurons identification and visualization of t-SNE.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) models face challenges due to the unique attributes of our knowledge graph, including directed and undirected relationships, attributed nodes, and minimal annotated competitor connections. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph embedding model, JPEC(JPMorgan Proximity Embedding for Competitor Detection), which utilizes graph neural network to learn from both first-order and second-order node proximity together with vital features for competitor retrieval. JPEC had outperformed most existing models in extensive experiments, showcasing its effectiveness in competitor retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, accepted by SIGIR'24</p></details> |

Our goal is to assist auditors in identifying agent actions that cannot be explained by the activity within their surrounding context, where normal activity patterns are established from historical data. We apply our method to help audit millions of actions of over three thousand support agents. We collect logs from the tools used by support agents and construct a bipartite graph of Actions and Entities representing all the actions of the agents, as well as background information about entities. From this graph, we sample subgraphs rooted on security-significant actions taken by the agents. Each subgraph captures the relevant context of the root action in terms of other actions, entities and their relationships. We then prioritize the rooted-subgraphs for auditor review using feed-forward and graph neural networks, as well as nearest neighbors techniques. To alleviate the issue of scarce labeling data, we use contrastive learning and domain-specific data augmentations. Expert auditors label the top ranked subgraphs as ``worth auditing" or ``not worth auditing" based on the company's business policies. This system finds subgraphs that are worth auditing with high enough precision to be used in production.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging large-scale graph-based nationwide road network data across 49 states in the USA, our study first posits the Concurrency Hypothesis from intuitive observations, suggesting a significant likelihood of incidents occurring at neighboring nodes within the road network. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce two novel metrics, Average Neighbor Crash Density (ANCD) and Average Neighbor Crash Continuity (ANCC), and subsequently employ them in statistical tests to validate the hypothesis rigorously. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Concurrency Prior (CP) method, a powerful approach designed to enhance the predictive capabilities of general Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in semi-supervised traffic incident prediction tasks. Our method allows GNNs to incorporate concurrent incident information, as mentioned in the hypothesis, via tokenization with negligible extra parameters. The extensive experiments, utilizing real-world data across states and cities in the USA, demonstrate that integrating CP into 12 state-of-the-art GNN architectures leads to significant improvements, with gains ranging from 3% to 13% in F1 score and 1.3% to 9% in AUC metrics.

However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the II edition of the Workshop on Unifying Representations in Neural Models (UniReps 2024)</p></details> |

Recent work has suggested that these limitations can be overcome by using unique node identifiers (UIDs). Here we argue that despite the advantages of UIDs, one of their disadvantages is that they lose the desirable property of permutation-equivariance. We thus propose to focus on UID models that are permutation-equivariant, and present theoretical arguments for their advantages. Motivated by this, we propose a method to regularize UID models towards permutation equivariance, via a contrastive loss. We empirically demonstrate that our approach improves generalization and extrapolation abilities while providing faster training convergence. On the recent BREC expressiveness benchmark, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other random-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

We assess the detection accuracy of these approaches and their potential to pinpoint the locations of specific sensor measurements under attack. Given the demonstrated success of GNNs in other time-series anomaly detection applications, we aim to evaluate their performance within the context of power systems cyber-attacks on sensor measurements. Utilizing the IEEE 68-bus system, we simulated four types of false data attacks, including scaling attacks, additive attacks, and their combinations, to test the selected approaches. Our results indicate that GNN-based methods outperform k-means and autoencoder in detection. Additionally, GNNs show promise in accurately localizing attacks for simple scenarios, although they still face challenges in more complex cases, especially ones that involve combinations of scaling and additive attacks.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, the complexity of their representations increase. Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-relational nature of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) make it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for well-known structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employing diagnostic classifiers. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 22 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[The Effectiveness of Curvature-Based Rewiring and the Role of Hyperparameters in GNNs Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09381v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing is the dominant paradigm in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The efficiency of message passing, however, can be limited by the topology of the graph. This happens when information is lost during propagation due to being oversquashed when travelling through bottlenecks. To remedy this, recent efforts have focused on graph rewiring techniques, which disconnect the input graph originating from the data and the computational graph, on which message passing is performed. A prominent approach for this is to use discrete graph curvature measures, of which several variants have been proposed, to identify and rewire around bottlenecks, facilitating information propagation. While oversquashing has been demonstrated in synthetic datasets, in this work we reevaluate the performance gains that curvature-based rewiring brings to real-world datasets. We show that in these datasets, edges selected during the rewiring process are not in line with theoretical criteria identifying bottlenecks. This implies they do not necessarily oversquash information during message passing. Subsequently, we demonstrate that SOTA accuracies on these datasets are outliers originating from sweeps of hyperparameters -- both the ones for training and dedicated ones related to the rewiring algorithm -- instead of consistent performance gains. In conclusion, our analysis nuances the effectiveness of curvature-based rewiring in real-world datasets and brings a new perspective on the methods to evaluate GNN accuracy improvements.</p></details> | 22 pages, 17 figures |
| **[High-Pass Graph Convolutional Network for Enhanced Anomaly Detection: A Novel Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01817v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) are widely used in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) due to their natural compatibility with graph structures, resulting in significant performance improvements. However, most researchers approach GAD as a graph node classification task and often rely on low-pass filters or feature aggregation from neighboring nodes. This paper proposes a novel approach by introducing a High-Pass Graph Convolution Network (HP-GCN) for GAD. The proposed HP-GCN leverages high-frequency components to detect anomalies, as anomalies tend to increase high-frequency signals within the network of normal nodes. Additionally, isolated nodes, which lack interactions with other nodes, present a challenge for Graph Neural Network (GNN). To address this, the model segments the graph into isolated nodes and nodes within connected subgraphs. Isolated nodes learn their features through Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), enhancing detection accuracy. The model is evaluated and validated on YelpChi, Amazon, T-Finance, and T-Social datasets. The results showed that the proposed HP-GCN can achieve anomaly detection accuracy of 96.10%, 98.16%, 96.46%, and 98.94%, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the HP-GCN outperforms existing GAD methods based on spatial domain GNN as well as those using low-pass and band-pass filters in spectral domain GCN. The findings underscore the effectiveness of this method in improving anomaly detection performance. Source code can be found at: https://github.com/meteor0033/High-pass_GAD.git.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their success in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics, GNNs often face challenges related to stability, generalization, and robustness to noise and adversarial attacks. Regularization techniques have shown promise in addressing these challenges by controlling model complexity and improving robustness. Building on recent advancements in contractive GNN architectures, this paper presents a novel method for inducing contractive behavior in any GNN through SVD regularization. By deriving a sufficient condition for contractiveness in the update step and applying constraints on network parameters, we demonstrate the impact of SVD regularization on the Lipschitz constant of GNNs. Our findings highlight the role of SVD regularization in enhancing the stability and generalization of GNNs, contributing to the development of more robust graph-based learning algorithms dynamics.</p></details> |  |

We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to surrogate polycrystal plasticity with complex geometries from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, aggregates them to obtain embeddings, and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. We demonstrate training GNN based on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh-graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. The GNN is trained on 80\% of the graphs and tested on the rest (90 graphs in total). We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals and learn the stress-strain maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained based on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are 0.993. The proposed GNN plasticity constitutive model speeds up more than 150 times compared with the benchmark FEM method on randomly selected test polycrystals. We also apply the trained GNN to 30 unseen FEM simulations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. Analysis of the von Mises stress distributions in polycrystals shows that the GNN model accurately learns the stress distribution with low error. By comparing the error distribution across training, testing, and unseen datasets, one deduces that the proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data. This work outlooks surrogating computationally intensive crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Position-Sensing Graph Neural Networks: Proactively Learning Nodes Relative Positions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11346v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node embeddings using the framework of message passing and aggregation. Such GNNs are incapable of learning relative positions between graph nodes within a graph. To empower GNNs with the awareness of node positions, some nodes are set as anchors. Then, using the distances from a node to the anchors, GNNs can infer relative positions between nodes. However, P-GNNs arbitrarily select anchors, leading to compromising position-awareness and feature extraction. To eliminate this compromise, we demonstrate that selecting evenly distributed and asymmetric anchors is essential. On the other hand, we show that choosing anchors that can aggregate embeddings of all the nodes within a graph is NP-complete. Therefore, devising efficient optimal algorithms in a deterministic approach is practically not feasible. To ensure position-awareness and bypass NP-completeness, we propose Position-Sensing Graph Neural Networks (PSGNNs), learning how to choose anchors in a back-propagatable fashion. Experiments verify the effectiveness of PSGNNs against state-of-the-art GNNs, substantially improving performance on various synthetic and real-world graph datasets while enjoying stable scalability. Specifically, PSGNNs on average boost AUC more than 14% for pairwise node classification and 18% for link prediction over the existing state-of-the-art position-aware methods.

This is necessarily inefficient because fitness reveals very little about solutions -- yet they contain more information that can be potentially exploited. To address this observation in genetic programming, we propose EvoNUDGE, which uses a graph neural network to elicit additional knowledge from symbolic regression problems. The network is queried on the problem before an evolutionary run to produce a library of subprograms, which is subsequently used to seed the initial population and bias the actions of search operators. In an extensive experiment on a large number of problem instances, EvoNUDGE is shown to significantly outperform multiple baselines, including the conventional tree-based genetic programming and the purely neural variant of the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the same-titled paper accepted at GECCO 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph-based Confidence Calibration for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02454v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One important approach to improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs) is to provide accurate confidence estimations regarding the correctness of their answers. However, developing a well-calibrated confidence estimation model is challenging, as mistakes made by LLMs can be difficult to detect. We propose a novel method combining the LLM's self-consistency with labeled data and training an auxiliary model to estimate the correctness of its responses to questions. This auxiliary model predicts the correctness of responses based solely on their consistent information. To set up the learning problem, we use a weighted graph to represent the consistency among the LLM's multiple responses to a question. Correctness labels are assigned to these responses based on their similarity to the correct answer. We then train a graph neural network to estimate the probability of correct responses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms several of the most recent methods in confidence calibration across multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly improves the generalization capability of confidence calibration on out-of-domain (OOD) data.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, distributed-memory solutions such as partitioning the graph to concurrently train multiple replicas of GNNs are in practice. However, approaches requiring a partitioned graph usually suffer from communication overhead and load imbalance, even under optimal partitioning and communication strategies due to irregularities in the neighborhood minibatch sampling. This paper proposes practical trade-offs for improving the sampling and communication overheads for representation learning on distributed graphs (using popular GraphSAGE architecture) by developing a parameterized continuous prefetch and eviction scheme on top of the state-of-the-art Amazon DistDGL distributed GNN framework, demonstrating about 15-40% improvement in end-to-end training performance on the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center's (NERSC) Perlmutter supercomputer for various OGB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network for High-Energy Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01641v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving 88.10% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GITSR: Graph Interaction Transformer-based Scene Representation for Multi Vehicle Collaborative Decision-making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01608v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose GITSR, an effective framework for Graph Interaction Transformer-based Scene Representation for multi-vehicle collaborative decision-making in intelligent transportation system. In the context of mixed traffic where Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human Driving Vehicles (HDVs) coexist, in order to enhance the understanding of the environment by CAVs to improve decision-making capabilities, this framework focuses on efficient scene representation and the modeling of spatial interaction behaviors of traffic states. We first extract features of the driving environment based on the background of intelligent networking. Subsequently, the local scene representation, which is based on the agent-centric and dynamic occupation grid, is calculated by the Transformer module. Besides, feasible region of the map is captured through the multi-head attention mechanism to reduce the collision of vehicles. Notably, spatial interaction behaviors, based on motion information, are modeled as graph structures and extracted via Graph Neural Network (GNN). Ultimately, the collaborative decision-making among multiple vehicles is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), with driving actions output by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Our algorithmic validation is executed within the extremely challenging scenario of highway off-ramp task, thereby substantiating the superiority of agent-centric approach to scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the GITSR method can not only effectively capture scene representation but also extract spatial interaction data, outperforming the baseline method across various comparative metrics.</p></details> |  |

First-principles quantum mechanical (QM) modeling became infeasible as the size of a material grew beyond hundreds of atoms. In this study, we developed a new computational tool integrating fragment-based graph neural networks (FBGNN) into the fragment-based many-body expansion (MBE) theory, referred to as FBGNN-MBE, and demonstrated its capacity to reproduce full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (FD-PES) for hierarchic chemical systems with manageable accuracy, complexity, and interpretability. In particular, we divided the entire system into basic building blocks (fragments), evaluated their single-fragment energies using a first-principles QM model and attacked many-fragment interactions using the structure-property relationships trained by FBGNNs. Our development of FBGNN-MBE demonstrated the potential of a new framework integrating deep learning models into fragment-based QM methods, and marked a significant step towards computationally aided design of large functional materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight paper to NeurIPS 2024 AI4Mat Workshop.

| **[Multimodal Graph Neural Network for Recommendation with Dynamic De-redundancy and Modality-Guided Feature De-noisy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01561v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become crucial in multimodal recommendation tasks because of their powerful ability to capture complex relationships between neighboring nodes. However, increasing the number of propagation layers in GNNs can lead to feature redundancy, which may negatively impact the overall recommendation performance. In addition, the existing recommendation task method directly maps the preprocessed multimodal features to the low-dimensional space, which will bring the noise unrelated to user preference, thus affecting the representation ability of the model. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose Multimodal Graph Neural Network for Recommendation (MGNM) with Dynamic De-redundancy and Modality-Guided Feature De-noisy, which is divided into local and global interaction. Initially, in the local interaction process,we integrate a dynamic de-redundancy (DDR) loss function which is achieved by utilizing the product of the feature coefficient matrix and the feature matrix as a penalization factor. It reduces the feature redundancy effects of multimodal and behavioral features caused by the stacking of multiple GNN layers. Subsequently, in the global interaction process, we developed modality-guided global feature purifiers for each modality to alleviate the impact of modality noise. It is a two-fold guiding mechanism eliminating modality features that are irrelevant to user preferences and captures complex relationships within the modality. Experimental results demonstrate that MGNM achieves superior performance on multimodal information denoising and removal of redundant information compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DuoGNN: Topology-aware Graph Neural Network with Homophily and Heterophily Interaction-Decoupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19616v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in various medical imaging applications, such as automated disease diagnosis. However, due to the local neighborhood aggregation paradigm in message passing which characterizes these models, they inherently suffer from two fundamental limitations: first, indistinguishable node embeddings due to heterophilic node aggregation (known as over-smoothing), and second, impaired message passing due to aggregation through graph bottlenecks (known as over-squashing). These challenges hinder the model expressiveness and prevent us from using deeper models to capture long-range node dependencies within the graph. Popular solutions in the literature are either too expensive to process large graphs due to high time complexity or do not generalize across all graph topologies. To address these limitations, we propose DuoGNN, a scalable and generalizable architecture which leverages topology to decouple homophilic and heterophilic edges and capture both short-range and long-range interactions. Our three core contributions introduce (i) a topological edge-filtering algorithm which extracts homophilic interactions and enables the model to generalize well for any graph topology, (ii) a heterophilic graph condensation technique which extracts heterophilic interactions and ensures scalability, and (iii) a dual homophilic and heterophilic aggregation pipeline which prevents over-smoothing and over-squashing during the message passing. We benchmark our model on medical and non-medical node classification datasets and compare it with its variants, showing consistent improvements across all tasks. Our DuoGNN code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/DuoGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[PageRank Bandits for Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01410v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a critical problem in graph learning with broad applications such as recommender systems and knowledge graph completion. Numerous research efforts have been directed at solving this problem, including approaches based on similarity metrics and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, most existing solutions are still rooted in conventional supervised learning, which makes it challenging to adapt over time to changing customer interests and to address the inherent dilemma of exploitation versus exploration in link prediction. To tackle these challenges, this paper reformulates link prediction as a sequential decision-making process, where each link prediction interaction occurs sequentially. We propose a novel fusion algorithm, PRB (PageRank Bandits), which is the first to combine contextual bandits with PageRank for collaborative exploitation and exploration. We also introduce a new reward formulation and provide a theoretical performance guarantee for PRB. Finally, we extensively evaluate PRB in both online and offline settings, comparing it with bandit-based and graph-based methods. The empirical success of PRB demonstrates the value of the proposed fusion approach. Our code is released at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/PRB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Physiological responses of the human body are influenced by human cognition and commonly used to analyze cognitive states. From a network science perspective, the interactions of these heterogeneous physiological modalities in a graph structure may provide insightful information to support prediction of cognitive states. However, there is no clue to derive exact connectivity between heterogeneous modalities and there exists a hierarchical structure of sub-modalities. Existing graph neural networks are designed to learn on non-hierarchical homogeneous graphs with pre-defined graph structures; they failed to learn from hierarchical, multi-modal physiological data without a pre-defined graph structure. To this end, we propose a hierarchical heterogeneous graph generative network (H2G2-Net) that automatically learns a graph structure without domain knowledge, as well as a powerful representation on the hierarchical heterogeneous graph in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the proposed method on the CogPilot dataset that consists of multi-modal physiological signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art GNNs by 5%-20% in prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in Human-Centric Representation Learning workshop at AAAI 2024 (https://hcrl-workshop.github.io/2024/)</p></details> |
| **[Pre-trained Molecular Language Models with Random Functional Group Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01401v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in computational chemistry have leveraged the power of trans-former-based language models, such as MoLFormer, pre-trained using a vast amount of simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) sequences, to understand and predict molecular properties and activities, a critical step in fields like drug discovery and materials science. To further improve performance, researchers have introduced graph neural networks with graph-based molecular representations, such as GEM, incorporating the topology, geometry, 2D or even 3D structures of molecules into pre-training. While most of molecular graphs in existing studies were automatically converted from SMILES sequences, it is to assume that transformer-based language models might be able to implicitly learn structure-aware representations from SMILES sequences. In this paper, we propose \ours{} -- a SMILES-based \underline{\em M}olecular \underline{\em L}anguage \underline{\em M}odel, which randomly masking SMILES subsequences corresponding to specific molecular \underline{\em F}unctional \underline{\em G}roups to incorporate structure information of atoms during the pre-training phase. This technique aims to compel the model to better infer molecular structures and properties, thus enhancing its predictive capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations across 11 benchmark classification and regression tasks in the chemical domain demonstrate the robustness and superiority of \ours{}. Our findings reveal that \ours{} outperforms existing pre-training models, either based on SMILES or graphs, in 9 out of the 11 downstream tasks, ranking as a close second in the remaining ones.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Multi-Channel Hypergraph Contrastive Learning for Matrix Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01376v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rating is a typical user explicit feedback that visually reflects how much a user likes a related item. The (rating) matrix completion is essentially a rating prediction process, which is also a significant problem in recommender systems. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in matrix completion, which captures users' preferences over items by formulating a rating matrix as a bipartite graph. However, existing methods are susceptible due to data sparsity and long-tail distribution in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the messaging mechanism of GNNs makes it difficult to capture high-order correlations and constraints between nodes, which are essentially useful in recommendation tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Channel Hypergraph Contrastive Learning framework for matrix completion, named MHCL. Specifically, MHCL adaptively learns hypergraph structures to capture high-order correlations between nodes and jointly captures local and global collaborative relationships through attention-based cross-view aggregation. Additionally, to consider the magnitude and order information of ratings, we treat different rating subgraphs as different channels, encourage alignment between adjacent ratings, and further achieve the mutual enhancement between different ratings through multi-channel cross-rating contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of Compositional Tasks with Logical Specification via Implicit Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09686v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the challenge of learning generalizable policies for compositional tasks defined by logical specifications. These tasks consist of multiple temporally extended sub-tasks. Due to the sub-task inter-dependencies and sparse reward issue in long-horizon tasks, existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, such as task-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, continue to struggle with slow convergence and sub-optimal performance in generalizing to compositional tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new hierarchical RL framework that enhances the efficiency and optimality of task generalization. At the high level, we present an implicit planner specifically designed for generalizing compositional tasks. This planner selects the next sub-task and estimates the multi-step return for completing the remaining task to complete from the current state. It learns a latent transition model and performs planning in the latent space by using a graph neural network (GNN). Subsequently, the high-level planner's selected sub-task guides the low-level agent to effectively handle long-horizon tasks, while the multi-step return encourages the low-level policy to account for future sub-task dependencies, enhancing its optimality. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the framework's advantages over previous methods in terms of both efficiency and optimality.</p></details> |  |

The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |
