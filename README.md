While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting superior interpretability. Our code is available at https://github.com/XDZhelheim/HimNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in KDD'24 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Towards Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937v5)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Traffic flow Prediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable traffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for explainable prediction of traffic flows.</p></details> | 31pages, 16 figures |
| **[TimeSeriesBench: An Industrial-Grade Benchmark for Time Series Anomaly Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10802v3)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has gained significant attention due to its real-world applications to improve the stability of modern software systems. However, there is no effective way to verify whether they can meet the requirements for real-world deployment. Firstly, current algorithms typically train a specific model for each time series. Maintaining such many models is impractical in a large-scale system with tens of thousands of curves. The performance of using merely one unified model to detect anomalies remains unknown. Secondly, most TSAD models are trained on the historical part of a time series and are tested on its future segment. In distributed systems, however, there are frequent system deployments and upgrades, with new, previously unseen time series emerging daily. The performance of testing newly incoming unseen time series on current TSAD algorithms remains unknown. Lastly, the assumptions of the evaluation metrics in existing benchmarks are far from practical demands. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose an industrial-grade benchmark TimeSeriesBench. We assess the performance of existing algorithms across more than 168 evaluation settings and provide comprehensive analysis for the future design of anomaly detection algorithms. An industrial dataset is also released along with TimeSeriesBench.</p></details> | Accepted by ISSRE'24 |
| **[Order-preserving pattern mining with forgetting mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15563v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Order-preserving pattern (OPP) mining is a type of sequential pattern mining method in which a group of ranks of time series is used to represent an OPP. This approach can discover frequent trends in time series. Existing OPP mining algorithms consider data points at different time to be equally important; however, newer data usually have a more significant impact, while older data have a weaker impact. We therefore introduce the forgetting mechanism into OPP mining to reduce the importance of older data. This paper explores the mining of OPPs with forgetting mechanism (OPF) and proposes an algorithm called OPF-Miner that can discover frequent OPFs. OPF-Miner performs two tasks, candidate pattern generation and support calculation. In candidate pattern generation, OPF-Miner employs a maximal support priority strategy and a group pattern fusion strategy to avoid redundant pattern fusions. For support calculation, we propose an algorithm called support calculation with forgetting mechanism, which uses prefix and suffix pattern pruning strategies to avoid redundant support calculations. The experiments are conducted on nine datasets and 12 alternative algorithms. The results verify that OPF-Miner is superior to other competitive algorithms. More importantly, OPF-Miner yields good clustering performance for time series, since the forgetting mechanism is employed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unicorn: U-Net for Sea Ice Forecasting with Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03929v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sea ice at the North Pole is vital to global climate dynamics. However, accurately forecasting sea ice poses a significant challenge due to the intricate interaction among multiple variables. Leveraging the capability to integrate multiple inputs and powerful performances seamlessly, many studies have turned to neural networks for sea ice forecasting. This paper introduces a novel deep architecture named Unicorn, designed to forecast weekly sea ice. Our model integrates multiple time series images within its architecture to enhance its forecasting performance. Moreover, we incorporate a bottleneck layer within the U-Net architecture, serving as neural ordinary differential equations with convolution operations, to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of latent variables. Through real data analysis with datasets spanning from 1998 to 2021, our proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in the sea ice concentration forecasting task. It achieves an average MAE improvement of 12% compared to benchmark models. Additionally, our method outperforms existing approaches in sea ice extent forecasting, achieving a classification performance improvement of approximately 18%. These experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method: State Estimation from Few Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16411v2)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) estimates a function from its incomplete pointwise measurements. Unfortunately, DEIM suffers large interpolation errors when few measurements are available. Here, we introduce Sparse DEIM (S-DEIM) for accurately estimating a function even when very few measurements are available. To this end, S-DEIM leverages a kernel vector which has been neglected in previous DEIM-based methods. We derive theoretical error estimates for S-DEIM, showing its relatively small error when an optimal kernel vector is used. When the function is generated by a continuous-time dynamical system, we propose a data assimilation algorithm which approximates the optimal kernel vector using observational time series. We prove that, under certain conditions, data assimilated S-DEIM converges exponentially fast towards the true state. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions.

| **[Multimedia Traffic Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14884v3)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accuracy anomaly detection in user-level social multimedia traffic is crucial for privacy security. Compared with existing models that passively detect specific anomaly classes with large labeled training samples, user-level social multimedia traffic contains sizeable new anomaly classes with few labeled samples and has an imbalance, self-similar, and data-hungry nature. Recent advances, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), solve it by learning a sample generator only from seen class samples to synthesize new samples. However, if we detect many new classes, the number of synthesizing samples would be unfeasibly estimated, and this operation will drastically increase computational complexity and energy consumption. Motivation on these limitations, in this paper, we propose \textit{Meta-UAD}, a Meta-learning scheme for User-level social multimedia traffic Anomaly Detection. This scheme relies on the episodic training paradigm and learns from the collection of K-way-M-shot classification tasks, which can use the pre-trained model to adapt any new class with few samples by going through few iteration steps. Since user-level social multimedia traffic emerges from a complex interaction process of users and social applications, we further develop a feature extractor to improve scheme performance. It extracts statistical features using cumulative importance ranking and time-series features using an LSTM-based AutoEncoder. We evaluate our scheme on two public datasets and the results further demonstrate the superiority of Meta-UAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Public Transit Arrival Prediction: a Seq2Seq RNN Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01655v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrival/Travel times for public transit exhibit variability on account of factors like seasonality, dwell times at bus stops, traffic signals, travel demand fluctuation etc. The developing world in particular is plagued by additional factors like lack of lane discipline, excess vehicles, diverse modes of transport and so on. This renders the bus arrival time prediction (BATP) to be a challenging problem especially in the developing world. A novel data-driven model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is proposed for BATP (in real-time) in the current work. The model intelligently incorporates both spatial and temporal correlations in a unique (non-linear) fashion distinct from existing approaches. In particular, we propose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based Encoder-Decoder(ED) OR Seq2Seq RNN model (originally introduced for language translation) for BATP. The geometry of the dynamic real time BATP problem enables a nice fit with the Encoder-Decoder based RNN structure. We feed relevant additional synchronized inputs (from previous trips) at each step of the decoder (a feature classically unexplored in machine translation applications). Further motivated from accurately modelling congestion influences on travel time prediction, we additionally propose to use a bidirectional layer at the decoder (something unexplored in other time-series based ED application contexts). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on real field data collected from challenging traffic conditions. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms diverse existing state-of-art data-driven approaches proposed for the same problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[The power of visualizing distributional differences: Formal graphical $n$-sample tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01838v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical tests are available for the two-sample test of correspondence of distribution functions. From these, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test provides also the graphical interpretation of the test results, in different forms. Here, we propose modifications of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with higher power. The proposed tests are based on the so-called global envelope test which allows for graphical interpretation, similarly as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The tests are based on rank statistics and are suitable also for the comparison of $n$ samples, with $n \geq 2$. We compare the alternatives for the two-sample case through an extensive simulation study and discuss their interpretation. Finally, we apply the tests to real data. Specifically, we compare the height distributions between boys and girls at different ages, the sepal length distributions of different flower species, and distributions of standardized residuals from a time series model for different exchange courses using the proposed methodologies.</p></details> | 23 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Causality for Earth Science -- A Review on Time-series and Spatiotemporal Causality Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05746v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey paper covers the breadth and depth of time-series and spatiotemporal causality methods, and their applications in Earth Science. More specifically, the paper presents an overview of causal discovery and causal inference, explains the underlying causal assumptions, and enlists evaluation techniques and key terminologies of the domain area. The paper elicits the various state-of-the-art methods introduced for time-series and spatiotemporal causal analysis along with their strengths and limitations. The paper further describes the existing applications of several methods for answering specific Earth Science questions such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, teleconnections etc. This survey paper can serve as a primer for Data Science researchers interested in data-driven causal study as we share a list of resources, such as Earth Science datasets (synthetic, simulated and observational data) and open source tools for causal analysis. It will equally benefit the Earth Science community interested in taking an AI-driven approach to study the causality of different dynamic and thermodynamic processes as we present the open challenges and opportunities in performing causality-based Earth Science study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Sieve Bootstrap for the Partial Sum Process with Application to Change-Point Detection without Dimension Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05071v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change-points in functional time series can be detected using the CUSUM-statistic, which is a non-linear functional of the partial sum process. Various methods have been proposed to obtain critical values for this statistic. In this paper we use the functional autoregressive sieve bootstrap to imitate the behavior of the partial sum process and we show that this procedure asymptotically correct estimates critical values under the null hypothesis. We also establish the consistency of the corresponding bootstrap based test under local alternatives. The finite sample performance of the procedure is studied via simulations under the null -hypothesis and under the alternative.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442v3)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to a data set made of observations from age distribution in different countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Likelihood estimation for stochastic differential equations with mixed effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17257v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations provide a powerful and versatile tool for modelling dynamic phenomena affected by random noise. In case of repeated observations of time series for several experimental units, it is often the case that some of the parameters vary between the individual experimental units, which has motivated a considerable interest in stochastic differential equations with mixed effects, where a subset of the parameters are random. These models enables simultaneous representation of randomness in the dynamics and variability between experimental units. When the data are observations at discrete time points, the likelihood function is only rarely explicitly available, so for likelihood based inference numerical methods are needed. We present Gibbs samplers and stochastic EM-algorithms based on the simple methods for simulation of diffusion bridges in Bladt and S{\o}rensen (2014). These methods are easy to implement and have no tuning parameters. They are, moreover, computationally efficient at low sampling frequencies because the computing time increases linearly with the time between observations. The algorithms are shown to simplify considerably for exponential families of diffusion processes. In a simulation study, the estimation methods are shown to work well for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and t-diffusions with mixed effects. Finally, the Gibbs sampler is applied to neuronal data.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17253v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Anomaly Detection in Time Series of EDFA Pump Currents to Monitor Degeneration Processes using Fuzzy Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15268v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Improving Time Series Classification with Representation Soft Label Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17010v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous research has indicated that deep neural network based models for time series classification (TSC) tasks are prone to overfitting. This issue can be mitigated by employing strategies that prevent the model from becoming overly confident in its predictions, such as label smoothing and confidence penalty. Building upon the concept of label smoothing, we propose a novel approach to generate more reliable soft labels, which we refer to as representation soft label smoothing. We apply label smoothing, confidence penalty, and our method representation soft label smoothing to several TSC models and compare their performance with baseline method which only uses hard labels for training. Our results demonstrate that the use of these enhancement techniques yields competitive results compared to the baseline method. Importantly, our method demonstrates strong performance across models with varying structures and complexities.</p></details> | 14 pages,6 figures |
| **[A Scalable k-Medoids Clustering via Whale Optimization Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16993v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised clustering has emerged as a critical tool for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast, unlabeled datasets. However, traditional methods like Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) struggle with scalability due to their quadratic computational complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce WOA-kMedoids, a novel unsupervised clustering method that incorporates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a nature-inspired metaheuristic inspired by the hunting strategies of humpback whales. By optimizing centroid selection, WOA-kMedoids reduces computational complexity of the k-medoids algorithm from quadratic to near-linear with respect to the number of observations. This improvement in efficiency enables WOA-kMedoids to be scalable to large datasets while maintaining high clustering accuracy. We evaluated the performance of WOA-kMedoids on 25 diverse time series datasets from the UCR archive. Our empirical results demonstrate that WOA-kMedoids maintains clustering accuracy similar to PAM. While WOA-kMedoids exhibited slightly higher runtime than PAM on small datasets (less than 300 observations), it outperformed PAM in computational efficiency on larger datasets. The scalability of WOA-kMedoids, combined with its consistently high accuracy, positions it as a promising and practical choice for unsupervised clustering in big data applications. WOA-kMedoids has implications for efficient knowledge discovery in massive, unlabeled datasets across various domains.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01138v3)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLFormer: Enhancing Explainability in Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using Distributed Lag Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16896v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>. Most real-world variables are multivariate time series influenced by past values and explanatory factors. Consequently, predicting these time series data using artificial intelligence is ongoing. In particular, in fields such as healthcare and finance, where reliability is crucial, having understandable explanations for predictions is essential. However, achieving a balance between high prediction accuracy and intuitive explainability has proven challenging. Although attention-based models have limitations in representing the individual influences of each variable, these models can influence the temporal dependencies in time series prediction and the magnitude of the influence of individual variables. To address this issue, this study introduced DLFormer, an attention-based architecture integrated with distributed lag embedding, to temporally embed individual variables and capture their temporal influence. Through validation against various real-world datasets, DLFormer showcased superior performance improvements compared to existing attention-based high-performance models. Furthermore, comparing the relationships between variables enhanced the reliability of explainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperdimensional Vector Tsetlin Machines with Applications to Sequence Learning and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16620v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct a two-layered model for learning and generating sequential data that is both computationally fast and competitive with vanilla Tsetlin machines, adding numerous advantages. Through the use of hyperdimensional vector computing (HVC) algebras and Tsetlin machine clause structures, we demonstrate that the combination of both inherits the generality of data encoding and decoding of HVC with the fast interpretable nature of Tsetlin machines to yield a powerful machine learning model. We apply the approach in two areas, namely in forecasting, generating new sequences, and classification. For the latter, we derive results for the entire UCR Time Series Archive and compare with the standard benchmarks to see how well the method competes in time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blending Low and High-Level Semantics of Time Series for Better Masked Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16613v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art approaches in time series generation (TSG), such as TimeVQVAE, utilize vector quantization-based tokenization to effectively model complex distributions of time series. These approaches first learn to transform time series into a sequence of discrete latent vectors, and then a prior model is learned to model the sequence. The discrete latent vectors, however, only capture low-level semantics (\textit{e.g.,} shapes). We hypothesize that higher-fidelity time series can be generated by training a prior model on more informative discrete latent vectors that contain both low and high-level semantics (\textit{e.g.,} characteristic dynamics). In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, termed NC-VQVAE, to integrate self-supervised learning into those TSG methods to derive a discrete latent space where low and high-level semantics are captured. Our experimental results demonstrate that NC-VQVAE results in a considerable improvement in the quality of synthetic samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[sEMG-Driven Physics-Informed Gated Recurrent Networks for Modeling Upper Limb Multi-Joint Movement Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16599v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exoskeletons and rehabilitation systems offer great potential for enhancing human strength and recovery through advanced human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that adapt to movement dynamics. However, the real-time application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is limited by their reliance on fixed input lengths and surrogate models. This study introduces a novel physics-informed Gated Recurrent Network (PiGRN) designed to predict multi-joint torques using surface electromyography (sEMG) data. The PiGRN model employs a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to convert time-series sEMG inputs into multi-joint kinematics and external loads, which are then integrated into an equation of motion to ensure consistency with physical laws. Experimental validation with sEMG data from five participants performing elbow flexion-extension tasks showed that the PiGRN model accurately predicted joint torques for 10 unfamiliar movements, with RMSE values between 4.02\% and 11.40\% and correlation coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.98. These findings highlight the PiGRN's potential for real-time exoskeleton and rehabilitation applications. Future research will explore more diverse datasets, improve musculoskeletal models, and investigate unsupervised learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian mortality modelling with pandemics: a vanishing jump approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04920v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper extends the Lee-Carter model for single- and multi-populations to account for pandemic jump effects of vanishing kind, allowing for a more comprehensive and accurate representation of mortality rates during a pandemic, characterised by a high impact at the beginning and gradually vanishing effects over subsequent periods. While the Lee-Carter model is effective in capturing mortality trends, it may not be able to account for large, unexpected jumps in mortality rates caused by pandemics or wars. Existing models allow either for transient jumps with an effect of one period only or persistent jumps. However, there is no literature on estimating mortality time series with jumps having an effect over a small number of periods as typically observed in pandemics. The Bayesian approach allows to quantify the uncertainty around the parameter estimates. Empirical data from the COVID-19 pandemic shows the superiority of the proposed approach, compared to models with a transitory shock effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[TinyTNAS: GPU-Free, Time-Bound, Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search for TinyML Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16535v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present TinyTNAS, a novel hardware-aware multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) tool specifically designed for TinyML time series classification. Unlike traditional NAS methods that rely on GPU capabilities, TinyTNAS operates efficiently on CPUs, making it accessible for a broader range of applications. Users can define constraints on RAM, FLASH, and MAC operations to discover optimal neural network architectures within these parameters. Additionally, the tool allows for time-bound searches, ensuring the best possible model is found within a user-specified duration. By experimenting with benchmark dataset UCI HAR, PAMAP2, WISDM, MIT BIH, and PTB Diagnostic ECG Databas TinyTNAS demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy with significant reductions in RAM, FLASH, MAC usage, and latency. For example, on the UCI HAR dataset, TinyTNAS achieves a 12x reduction in RAM usage, a 144x reduction in MAC operations, and a 78x reduction in FLASH memory while maintaining superior accuracy and reducing latency by 149x. Similarly, on the PAMAP2 and WISDM datasets, it achieves a 6x reduction in RAM usage, a 40x reduction in MAC operations, an 83x reduction in FLASH, and a 67x reduction in latency, all while maintaining superior accuracy. Notably, the search process completes within 10 minutes in a CPU environment. These results highlight TinyTNAS's capability to optimize neural network architectures effectively for resource-constrained TinyML applications, ensuring both efficiency and high performance. The code for TinyTNAS is available at the GitHub repository and can be accessed at https://github.com/BidyutSaha/TinyTNAS.git.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Time-Series Training Dataset through Lens of Spectrum in Deep State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16261v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates a method to evaluate time-series datasets in terms of the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) with state space models (deep SSMs) trained on the dataset. SSMs have attracted attention as components inside DNNs to address time-series data. Since deep SSMs have powerful representation capacities, training datasets play a crucial role in solving a new task. However, the effectiveness of training datasets cannot be known until deep SSMs are actually trained on them. This can increase the cost of data collection for new tasks, as a trial-and-error process of data collection and time-consuming training are needed to achieve the necessary performance. To advance the practical use of deep SSMs, the metric of datasets to estimate the performance early in the training can be one key element. To this end, we introduce the concept of data evaluation methods used in system identification. In system identification of linear dynamical systems, the effectiveness of datasets is evaluated by using the spectrum of input signals. We introduce this concept to deep SSMs, which are nonlinear dynamical systems. We propose the K-spectral metric, which is the sum of the top-K spectra of signals inside deep SSMs, by focusing on the fact that each layer of a deep SSM can be regarded as a linear dynamical system. Our experiments show that the K-spectral metric has a large absolute value of the correlation coefficient with the performance and can be used to evaluate the quality of training datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Using data from a real-world maternal health program, we demonstrate how a cognitive model based on Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory can augment existing purely computational approaches. Our findings show that, compared to general time-series forecasters (e.g., LSTMs), IBL models, which reflect human decision-making processes, better predict the dynamics of individuals' states. Additionally, IBL provides estimates of the volatility in individuals' states and their sensitivity to interventions, which can improve the efficiency of training of other time series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Mode Decomposition and Linear Embeddings are What You Need For Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16122v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting often faces challenges due to data volatility, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data into distinct modes, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. In this study, we integrate VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our approach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4, and 10 air quality datasets from various Southeast Asian cities. The effectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it. Additionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural network architectures such as LSTM, BLSTM, and RNN. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following VMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average RMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the DLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE across all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For accossiated repository, see https://github.com/Espalemit/VMD-With-LTSF-Linear.git</p></details> |

Mixture of Universals (MoU) Is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15997v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting requires balancing short-term and long-term dependencies for accurate predictions. Existing methods mainly focus on long-term dependency modeling, neglecting the complexities of short-term dynamics, which may hinder performance. Transformers are superior in modeling long-term dependencies but are criticized for their quadratic computational cost. Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective in time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss. Current architectures fall short in offering both high efficiency and strong performance for long-term dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Universals (MoU), a versatile model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies for enhancing performance in time series forecasting. MoU is composed of two novel designs: Mixture of Feature Extractors (MoF), an adaptive method designed to improve time series patch representations for short-term dependency, and Mixture of Architectures (MoA), which hierarchically integrates Mamba, FeedForward, Convolution, and Self-Attention architectures in a specialized order to model long-term dependency from a hybrid perspective. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining relatively low computational costs. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoU.

However, DNN training is a resource-intensive task, making the implementation and execution of DNN training algorithms on MCUs challenging due to low processor speeds, constrained throughput, limited floating-point support, and memory constraints. In this work, we explore on-device training of DNNs for Cortex-M MCUs. We present a method that enables efficient training of DNNs completely in place on the MCU using fully quantized training (FQT) and dynamic partial gradient updates. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multiple vision and time-series datasets and provide insights into the tradeoff between training accuracy, memory overhead, energy, and latency on real hardware.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and GRU (Gate Recurrent Units) have contributed to improving the predictive accuracy of TSF. Furthermore, model structures have been proposed to combine time-series decomposition methods, such as seasonal-trend decomposition using Loess (STL) to ensure improved predictive accuracy. However, because this approach is learned in an independent model for each component, it cannot learn the relationships between time-series components. In this study, we propose a new neural architecture called a correlation recurrent unit (CRU) that can perform time series decomposition within a neural cell and learn correlations (autocorrelation and correlation) between each decomposition component. The proposed neural architecture was evaluated through comparative experiments with previous studies using five univariate time-series datasets and four multivariate time-series data. The results showed that long- and short-term predictive performance was improved by more than 10%. The experimental results show that the proposed CRU is an excellent method for TSF problems compared to other neural architectures.</p></details> |  |

Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024</p></details> |

Yet, to fully unlock this potential, requirements imposed by various stakeholders must be fulfilled, regarding, e.g., efficiency or trust assumptions. While many of these requirements can be addressed by deploying advanced secure computation paradigms such as fully homomorphic encryption, certain aspects require an integration with additional privacy-preserving technologies. In this work, we perform a qualitative requirements elicitation based on selected real-world use cases. We match the derived requirements categories against the features and guarantees provided by available technologies. For each technology, we additionally perform a maturity assessment, including the state of standardization and availability on the market. Furthermore, we provide a decision tree supporting application developers in identifying the most promising technologies available matching their needs.

| **[NeuroVE: Brain-inspired Linear-Angular Velocity Estimation with Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15663v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based ego-velocity estimation is a fundamental problem in robot state estimation. However, the constraints of frame-based cameras, including motion blur and insufficient frame rates in dynamic settings, readily lead to the failure of conventional velocity estimation techniques. Mammals exhibit a remarkable ability to accurately estimate their ego-velocity during aggressive movement. Hence, integrating this capability into robots shows great promise for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired framework for linear-angular velocity estimation, dubbed NeuroVE. The NeuroVE framework employs an event camera to capture the motion information and implements spiking neural networks (SNNs) to simulate the brain's spatial cells' function for velocity estimation. We formulate the velocity estimation as a time-series forecasting problem. To this end, we design an Astrocyte Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ALIF) neuron model to encode continuous values. Additionally, we have developed an Astrocyte Spiking Long Short-term Memory (ASLSTM) structure, which significantly improves the time-series forecasting capabilities, enabling an accurate estimate of ego-velocity. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments indicate that NeuroVE has achieved an approximate 60% increase in accuracy compared to other SNN-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

The present study introduces a novel fine-grained analysis to examine topological alterations in neurodegeneration pertaining to six different brain networks of MCI subjects (Early/Late MCI). To achieve this, fMRI time series from two distinct populations are investigated: (i) the publicly accessible ADNI dataset and (ii) our in-house dataset. The study utilizes sliding window embedding to convert each fMRI time series into a sequence of 3-dimensional vectors, facilitating the assessment of changes in regional brain topology. Distinct persistence diagrams are computed for Betti descriptors of dimension-0, 1, and 2. Wasserstein distance metric is used to quantify differences in topological characteristics. We have examined both (i) ROI-specific inter-subject interactions and (ii) subject-specific inter-ROI interactions. Further, a new deep learning model is proposed for classification, achieving a maximum classification accuracy of 95% for the ADNI dataset and 85% for the in-house dataset. This methodology is further adapted for the differential diagnosis of MCI sub-types, resulting in a peak accuracy of 76.5%, 91.1% and 80% in classifying HC Vs. EMCI, HC Vs. LMCI and EMCI Vs. LMCI, respectively. We showed that the proposed approach surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques designed for classifying MCI and its sub-types using fMRI.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, accepted at International Conference on Pattern Recognition 2024</p></details> |
| **[Network Representation of Higher-Order Interactions Based on Information Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15617v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex systems in science and engineering are modeled as networks whose nodes and links depict the temporal evolution of each system unit and the dynamic interaction between pairs of units, which are assessed respectively using measures of auto- and cross-correlation or variants thereof. However, a growing body of work is documenting that this standard network representation can neglect potentially crucial information shared by three or more dynamic processes in the form of higher-order interactions (HOIs). While several measures, mostly derived from information theory, are available to assess HOIs in network systems mapped by multivariate time series, none of them is able to provide a compact and detailed representation of higher-order interdependencies. In this work, we fill this gap by introducing a framework for the assessment of HOIs in dynamic network systems at different levels of resolution. The framework is grounded on the dynamic implementation of the O-information, a new measure assessing HOIs in dynamic networks, which is here used together with its local counterpart and its gradient to quantify HOIs respectively for the network as a whole, for each link, and for each node. The integration of these measures into the conventional network representation results in a tool for the representation of HOIs as networks, which is defined formally using measures of information dynamics, implemented in its linear version by using vector regression models and statistical validation techniques, illustrated in simulated network systems, and finally applied to an illustrative example in the field of network physiology.</p></details> |  |

However, the explainability of those established machine learning models remains a big concern. In this research, in contrast, we learn from cognitive science concept and study how ophthalmologists judge glaucoma detection. Simulating experts' efforts, we propose a hierarchical decision making system, centered around a holistic set of carefully designed biomarker-oriented machine learning models. While biomarkers represent the key indicators of how ophthalmologists identify glaucoma, they usually exhibit latent inter-relations. We thus construct a time series model, named TRI-LSTM, capable of calculating and uncovering potential and latent relationships among various biomarkers of glaucoma. Our model is among the first efforts to explore the intrinsic connections among glaucoma biomarkers. We monitor temporal relationships in patients' disease states over time and to capture and retain the progression of disease-relevant clinical information from prior visits, thereby enriching biomarker's potential relationships. Extensive experiments over real-world dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 images |
| **[Predicting Parameter Change's Effect on Cellular Network Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15516v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cellular network provides convenient network access for ever-growing mobile phones. During the continuous optimization, operators can adjust cell parameters to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) flexibly. A precise prediction of the parameter change's effect can help operators make proper parameter adjustments. This work focuses on predicting cell status (like the workload and QoS) after adjusting the cell parameters. The prediction will be conducted before an adjustment is actually applied to provide an early inspection. As it can be hard for available parameter adjustments with a limited number to cover all the parameter and user behavior combinations, we propose ParaSeer fusing domain knowledge on parameter adjustments into data-driven time series forecasting. ParaSeer organizes several pre-trained Transformers for adjustment-free time series forecasting, utilizing plenty of adjustment-free data. On the other hand, ParaSeer models the effect of adjusting the transmission power and cell individual offset (CIO) as a multiplier for the workload. We derive a formula to calculate the multiplier from the underlying mechanism of those two parameters, helping ParaSeer eliminate the thirst for data with parameter adjustments. We compare ParaSeer with baselines on two real-world datasets, where ParaSeer outperforms the best baseline by more than 25.8% in terms of RMSE. The extensive experiments further illustrate the contributions of ParaSeer's components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling parameters of ordinary differential equations with Langevin dynamics that satisfy constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15505v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we obtain more than a hundred fold speedup relative to a leading ensemble MCMC approach that requires numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |

Learning representations by extracting and inferring valuable information from these time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of particular phenomena and enabling informed decisions. With the learned representations, we can perform numerous downstream analyses more effectively. Among several approaches, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in extracting hidden patterns and features from time-series data without manual feature engineering. This survey first presents a novel taxonomy based on three fundamental elements in designing state-of-the-art universal representation learning methods for time series. According to the proposed taxonomy, we comprehensively review existing studies and discuss their intuitions and insights into how these methods enhance the quality of learned representations.

Given observations of the system state over time, we formulate the forecasting problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of the future system state given its current state. To this end, we leverage the framework of stochastic interpolants, which facilitates the construction of a generative model between an arbitrary base distribution and the target. We design a fictitious, non-physical stochastic dynamics that takes as initial condition the current system state and produces as output a sample from the target conditional distribution in finite time and without bias. This process therefore maps a point mass centered at the current state onto a probabilistic ensemble of forecasts. We prove that the drift coefficient entering the stochastic differential equation (SDE) achieving this task is non-singular, and that it can be learned efficiently by square loss regression over the time-series data. We show that the drift and the diffusion coefficients of this SDE can be adjusted after training, and that a specific choice that minimizes the impact of the estimation error gives a F\"ollmer process. We highlight the utility of our approach on several complex, high-dimensional forecasting problems, including stochastically forced Navier-Stokes and video prediction on the KTH and CLEVRER datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of comprehensive summaries that consolidate these advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a comprehensive review of time series analysis techniques specifically within the educational context. We begin by exploring the landscape of educational data analytics, categorizing various data sources and types relevant to education. We then review four prominent time series methods-forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection-illustrating their specific application points in educational settings. Subsequently, we present a range of educational scenarios and applications, focusing on how these methods are employed to address diverse educational tasks, which highlights the practical integration of multiple time series methods to solve complex educational problems. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on future directions, including personalized learning analytics, multimodal data fusion, and the role of large language models (LLMs) in educational time series.

In contrast, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can offer insightful and systematic forest monitoring with complete time series (TS) due to signal penetration through clouds and day and night image acquisitions. This study aims to address the limitations of optical satellite data by using SAR data as an alternative for estimating optical VIs for forests through machine learning (ML). While this approach is less direct and likely only feasible through the power of ML, it raises the scientific question of whether enough relevant information is contained in the SAR signal to accurately estimate VIs. This work covers the estimation of TS of four VIs (LAI, FAPAR, EVI and NDVI) using multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR and ancillary data. The study focused on both healthy and disturbed temperate forest areas in Czechia for the year 2021, while ground truth labels generated from Sentinel-2 multispectral data. This was enabled by creating a paired multi-modal TS dataset in Google Earth Engine (GEE), including temporally and spatially aligned Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, DEM, weather and land cover datasets. The inclusion of DEM-derived auxiliary features and additional meteorological information, further improved the results. In the comparison of ML models, the traditional ML algorithms, RFR and XGBoost slightly outperformed the AutoML approach, auto-sklearn, for all VIs, achieving high accuracies ($R^2$ between 70-86%) and low errors (0.055-0.29 of MAE). In general, up to 240 measurements per year and a spatial resolution of 20 m can be achieved using estimated SAR-based VIs with high accuracy. A great advantage of the SAR-based VI is the ability to detect abrupt forest changes with sub-weekly temporal accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version of the preprint, based on comments from the reviewers.

However, evaluating explanations is often not trivial, and differences in applied metrics can be subtle, especially with non-intelligible data. Thus, there is a need for visualizations tailored to explore explanations for domains with such data, e.g., time series. We propose DAVOTS, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore raw time series data, activations of neural networks, and attributions in a dense-pixel visualization to gain insights into the data, models' decisions, and explanations. To further support users in exploring large datasets, we apply clustering approaches to the visualized data domains to highlight groups and present ordering strategies for individual and combined data exploration to facilitate finding patterns.

TL asserts that the variance is directly proportional to a power of the mean, exactly for population moments and, whether or not population moments exist, approximately for sample moments. In many papers, linear regression of log variance as a function of log mean is used to estimate TL's parameters. We provide some statistical guarantees with large-sample asymptotics for this kind of inference under general conditions, and we derive confidence intervals for the parameters. In many ecological applications, the means and variances are estimated over time or across space from arrays of abundance data collected at different locations and time points. When the ratio between the time-series length and the number of spatial points converges to a constant as both become large, the usual normalized statistics are asymptotically biased. We provide a bias correction to get correct confidence intervals. TL, widely studied in multiple sciences, is a source of challenging new statistical problems in a nonstationary spatiotemporal framework. We illustrate our results with both simulated and real data sets.</p></details> |  |

This knowledge is fundamental for decision-making in healthcare and public health domains. Investigating the presence, intensity, and precise nature of seasonal trends, as well as these temporal patterns, is essential for forecasting future occurrences, planning interventions, and making informed decisions based on the evolution of events over time. This study employs the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) to separate and analyze different periodic components by frequency in time series data, focusing on annually correlated (PC) principal components. Bootstrapping, a method used to estimate statistical sampling distributions through random sampling with replacement, is particularly useful in this context. Specifically, block bootstrapping, a model-independent resampling method suitable for time series data, is utilized. Its extensions are aimed at preserving the correlation structures inherent in PC processes. The VBPBB applies a bandpass filter to isolate the relevant PC frequency, thereby minimizing contamination from extraneous frequencies and noise. This approach significantly narrows the confidence intervals, enhancing the precision of estimated sampling distributions for the investigated periodic characteristics. Furthermore, we compared the outcomes of block bootstrapping for periodically correlated time series with VBPBB against those from more traditional bootstrapping methods. Our analysis shows VBPBB provides strong evidence of the existence of an annual seasonal PC pattern in hospitalization rates not detectible by other methods, providing timing and confidence intervals for their impact.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, these models can be tricked into making incorrect predictions with high confidence, leading to disastrous failures and security concerns. To this end, we explore the impact of adversarial attacks on multivariate time-series forecasting and investigate methods to counter them. Specifically, we employ untargeted white-box attacks, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), to poison the inputs to the training process, effectively misleading the model. We also illustrate the subtle modifications to the inputs after the attack, which makes detecting the attack using the naked eye quite difficult. Having demonstrated the feasibility of these attacks, we develop robust models through adversarial training and model hardening. We are among the first to showcase the transferability of these attacks and defenses by extrapolating our work from the benchmark electricity data to a larger, 10-year real-world data used for predicting the time-to-failure of hard disks. Our experimental results confirm that the attacks and defenses achieve the desired security thresholds, leading to a 72.41% and 94.81% decrease in RMSE for the electricity and hard disk datasets respectively after implementing the adversarial defenses.</p></details> | 17 pages, 32 figures |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

All these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solution by industry but they are rarely considered in the comparisons between competing methods which generally exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the case in industrial time-series.

To address this, this study develops time-series models to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended solids (SS), and turbidity using Sentinel-2 satellite data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the coastal regions of Hong Kong. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks, the study incorporates extensive temporal datasets to enhance prediction accuracy. The models utilize spectral data from Sentinel-2, focusing on optically active components, and demonstrate that selected variables closely align with the spectral characteristics of Chl-a and SS.

| **[Channel-wise Influence: Estimating Data Influence for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14763v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence function, a technique from robust statistics, measures the impact on model parameters or related functions when training data is removed or modified. This effective and valuable post-hoc method allows for studying the interpretability of machine learning models without requiring costly model retraining. It would provide extensions like increasing model performance, improving model generalization, and offering interpretability. Recently, Multivariate Time Series (MTS) analysis has become an important yet challenging task, attracting significant attention. However, there is no preceding research on the influence functions of MTS to shed light on the effects of modifying the channel of training MTS. Given that each channel in an MTS plays a crucial role in its analysis, it is essential to characterize the influence of different channels. To fill this gap, we propose a channel-wise influence function, which is the first method that can estimate the influence of different channels in MTS, utilizing a first-order gradient approximation that leverages the more informative average gradient of the data set. Additionally, we demonstrate how this influence function can be used to estimate the impact of a channel in MTS. Finally, we validated the accuracy and effectiveness of our influence estimation function in critical MTS analysis tasks, such as MTS anomaly detection and MTS forecasting. According to abundant experiments on real-world dataset, the original influence function performs worse than our method and even fail for the channel pruning problem, which demonstrate the superiority and necessity of channel-wise influence function in MTS analysis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Time-Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Image Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14756v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in time-series anomaly detection have relied on deep learning models to handle the diverse behaviors of time-series data. However, these models often suffer from unstable training and require extensive hyperparameter tuning, leading to practical limitations. Although foundation models present a potential solution, their use in time series is limited. To overcome these issues, we propose an innovative image-based, training-free time-series anomaly detection (ITF-TAD) approach. ITF-TAD converts time-series data into images using wavelet transform and compresses them into a single representation, leveraging image foundation models for anomaly detection. This approach achieves high-performance anomaly detection without unstable neural network training or hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, ITF-TAD identifies anomalies across different frequencies, providing users with a detailed visualization of anomalies and their corresponding frequencies. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including univariate and multivariate time series, demonstrate that ITF-TAD offers a practical and effective solution with performance exceeding or comparable to that of deep models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-factor analysis of citation networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14604v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One compelling use of citation networks is to characterize papers by their relationships to the surrounding literature. We propose a method to characterize papers by embedding them into two distinct "co-factor" spaces: one describing how papers send citations, and the other describing how papers receive citations. This approach presents several challenges. First, older documents cannot cite newer documents, and thus it is not clear that co-factors are even identifiable. We resolve this challenge by developing a co-factor model for asymmetric adjacency matrices with missing lower triangles and showing that identification is possible. We then frame estimation as a matrix completion problem and develop a specialized implementation of matrix completion because prior implementations are memory bound in our setting. Simulations show that our estimator has promising finite sample properties, and that naive approaches fail to recover latent co-factor structure. We leverage our estimator to investigate 237,794 papers published in statistics journals from 1898 to 2022, resulting in the most comprehensive topic model of the statistics literature to date. We find interpretable co-factors corresponding to many statistical subfields, including time series, variable selection, spatial methods, graphical models, GLM(M)s, causal inference, multiple testing, quantile regression, resampling, semi-parametrics, dimension reduction, and several more.</p></details> |  |

But beginning with the emergence of automated digital sky surveys, ca. ~2000, astronomers began producing large collections of data with more complex structure: light curves (brightness time series) and spectra (brightness vs. wavelength). These comprise what statisticians call *functional data* -- measurements of populations of functions. Upcoming automated sky surveys will soon provide astronomers with a flood of functional data. New methods are needed to accurately and optimally analyze large ensembles of light curves and spectra, accumulating information both along and across measured functions. Functional data analysis (FDA) provides tools for statistical modeling of functional data. Astronomical data presents several challenges for FDA methodology, e.g., sparse, irregular, and asynchronous sampling, and heteroscedastic measurement error. Bayesian FDA uses hierarchical Bayesian models for function populations, and is well suited to addressing these challenges. We provide an overview of astronomical functional data, and of some key Bayesian FDA modeling approaches, including functional mixed effects models, and stochastic process models. We briefly describe a Bayesian FDA framework combining FDA and machine learning methods to build low-dimensional parametric models for galaxy spectra.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures; for the Proceedings of the 43rd International Workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy Methods in Science and Engineering</p></details> |

An especially challenging case that has grown to prominence with advances in single-cell sequencing technologies is learning the behavior of individuals from population snapshots. In the absence of individual-level time series, standard stochastic differential equation models are often nonidentifiable because intrinsic diffusion cannot be distinguished from measurement noise. Despite the difficulty, accurately recovering diffusion terms is required to answer even basic questions about the system's behavior. We show how to combine population-level time series with velocity measurements to build a provably consistent estimator of the diffusion matrix.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published at the Deployable AI (DAI) workshop at AAAI-2024</p></details> |
| **[Early Prediction of Causes (not Effects) in Healthcare by Long-Term Clinical Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03816v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early syndrome diagnosis aims to solve the intricate task of predicting a ground truth label that most often is the outcome (effect) of a medical consensus definition applied to observed clinical measurements (causes), given clinical measurements observed several hours before. Instead of focusing on the prediction of the future effect, we propose to directly predict the causes via time series forecasting (TSF) of clinical variables and determine the effect by applying the gold standard consensus definition to the forecasted values. This method has the invaluable advantage of being straightforwardly interpretable to clinical practitioners, and because model training does not rely on a particular label anymore, the forecasted data can be used to predict any consensus-based label. We exemplify our method by means of long-term TSF with Transformer models, with a focus on accurate prediction of sparse clinical variables involved in the SOFA-based Sepsis-3 definition and the new Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) definition. Our experiments are conducted on two datasets and show that contrary to recent proposals which advocate set function encoders for time series and direct multi-step decoders, best results are achieved by a combination of standard dense encoders with iterative multi-step decoders. The key for success of iterative multi-step decoding can be attributed to its ability to capture cross-variate dependencies and to a student forcing training strategy that teaches the model to rely on its own previous time step predictions for the next time step prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC), Toronto, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Solar Active Regions Detection Via 2D Circular Kernel Time Series Transformation, Entropy and Machine Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08270v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an enhancement to the existing method for detecting Solar Active Regions (ARs). Our technique tracks ARs using images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). It involves a 2D circular kernel time series transformation, combined with Statistical and Entropy measures, and a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The technique transforms the circular area around pixels in the SDO AIA images into one-dimensional time series (1-DTS). Statistical measures (Median Value, Xmed; 95th Percentile, X95) and Entropy measures (Distribution Entropy, DisEn; Fuzzy Entropy, FuzzyEn) are used as feature selection methods (FSM 1), alongside a method applying 1-DTS elements directly as features (FSM 2). The ML algorithm classifies these series into three categories: no Active Region (nARs type 1, class 1), non-flaring Regions outside active regions with brightness (nARs type 2, class 2), and flaring Active Regions (ARs, class 3). The ML model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.900 and 0.914 for Entropy and Statistical measures, respectively. Notably, Fuzzy Entropy shows the highest classification accuracy (AKF=0.895), surpassing DisEn (AKF=0.738), X95 (AKF=0.873), and Xmed (AKF=0.840). This indicates the high effectiveness of Entropy and Statistical measures for AR detection in SDO AIA images. FSM 2 captures a similar distribution of flaring AR activities as FSM 1. Additionally, we introduce a generalizing characteristic of AR activities (GSA), finding a direct agreement between increased AR activities and higher GSA values. The Python code implementation of the proposed method is available in supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Previous methods for outbreak forecasting have faced limitations by not utilizing multiple sources of input and yielding suboptimal performance due to the limited availability of data. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address the challenges of infectious disease forecasting. We introduce a Multilateral Attention-enhanced GRU model that leverages information from multiple sources, thus enabling a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing the spread of a pandemic. By incorporating attention mechanisms within a GRU framework, our model can effectively capture complex relationships and temporal dependencies in the data, leading to improved forecasting performance. Further, we have curated a well-structured multi-source dataset for the recent COVID-19 pandemic that the research community can utilize as a great resource to conduct experiments and analysis on time-series forecasting. We evaluated the proposed model on our COVID-19 dataset and reported the output in terms of RMSE and MAE. The experimental results provide evidence that our proposed model surpasses existing techniques in terms of performance. We also performed performance gain and qualitative analysis on our dataset to evaluate the impact of the attention mechanism and show that the proposed model closely follows the trajectory of the pandemic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of COPD Using Machine Learning, Clinical Summary Notes, and Vital Signs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13958v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. In the United States, more than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of individuals living with at least one other chronic health condition. It is the 4th leading cause of death in the country. Over 2.2 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations. Monitoring and predicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. This paper presents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. These models use respiration summary notes, symptoms, and vital signs. To train and test these models, data records containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used. These records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical data obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. We achieved an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of COPD exacerbation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multi-modal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10-50 m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) that are traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time-series of climatic variables, and satellite time-series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.</p></details> |  |

Thus, growing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution networks (DN) is predicted. Impact analyzes must be performed to determine if mitigation means are needed to accommodate a large quantity of EVs in the DN. Furthermore, the habits of the local population resulting in different EVs charging patterns needs to be realistically considered. This article proposed an individual residential EVs multi-charging algorithm based on the observed charging behavior of 500 measured residential EVs located in a large North American utility. Probability functions are derived from the analysis of these charging patterns. These can be used to model daily charging profiles of individual EV to assess, in a quasi-static time-series perspective, their impact either on a single costumer or a whole DN. An impact evaluation study is also presented.</p></details> |  |

In particular, time-series of power consumption over geographical areas are essential in deciding the optimal placement of expensive resources (e.g., transformers, storage elements) and their activation schedules. However, publication of such data raises significant privacy issues, as it may reveal sensitive details about personal habits and lifestyles. Differential privacy (DP) is well-suited for sanitization of individual data, but current DP techniques for time series lead to significant loss in utility, due to the existence of temporal correlation between data readings. We introduce {\em STPT (Spatio-Temporal Private Timeseries)}, a novel method for DP-compliant publication of electricity consumption data that analyzes spatio-temporal attributes and captures both micro and macro patterns by leveraging RNNs. Additionally, it employs a partitioning method for releasing electricity consumption time series based on identified patterns. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, on both real-world and synthetic datasets, that STPT significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, providing a well-balanced trade-off between data utility and user privacy.</p></details> |  |

However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |

| **[Empowering Pre-Trained Language Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Decoupling Enhanced Discrete Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal time series forecasting plays a critical role in various real-world applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and climate analysis. The recent advancements in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have inspired efforts to reprogram these models for time series forecasting tasks, by leveraging their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches fall short in handling complex spatial inter-series dependencies and intrinsic intra-series frequency components, limiting their spatio-temporal forecasting performance. Moreover, the linear mapping of continuous time series to a compressed subset vocabulary in reprogramming constrains the spatio-temporal semantic expressivity of PLMs and may lead to potential information bottleneck. To overcome the above limitations, we propose \textsc{RePST}, a tailored PLM reprogramming framework for spatio-temporal forecasting. The key insight of \textsc{RePST} is to decouple the spatio-temporal dynamics in the frequency domain, allowing better alignment with the PLM text space. Specifically, we first decouple spatio-temporal data in Fourier space and devise a structural diffusion operator to obtain temporal intrinsic and spatial diffusion signals, making the dynamics more comprehensible and predictable for PLMs. To avoid information bottleneck from a limited vocabulary, we further propose a discrete reprogramming strategy that selects relevant discrete textual information from an expanded vocabulary space in a differentiable manner. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To meet these performance demands, we propose a novel backbone from the perspective of information fusion. Introducing the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module and the Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN), based on evidence theory, allows us to achieve superior performance. On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection. TEFN is not a model that achieves the ultimate in single aspect, but a model that balances performance, accuracy, stability, and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

A systematic analysis was conducted on key performance variables, including approach speed, drift angles, turning motions, distance from obstacles, and actuator utilization. The results demonstrate significant discrepancies between the empirical data and the established maneuvering characteristics. These findings have the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of conventional maneuvering models, such as the Mathematical Modeling Group (MMG) model, and improve the conditions used in captive model tests for the identification of maneuvering model parameters. Furthermore, these findings could inform the development of more robust autonomous berthing and unberthing algorithms and digital twins.</p></details> |  |

While recent contrastive learning strategies have focused on how to construct appropriate positives and negatives, in this study, we conduct theoretical analysis and find they have overlooked the fundamental issues: false negatives and class imbalance inherent in the InfoNCE loss-based framework. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward modification grounded in the SimCLR framework, universally adaptable to models engaged in the instance discrimination task. By constructing instance graphs to facilitate interactive learning among instances, we emulate supervised contrastive learning via the multiple-instances discrimination task, mitigating the harmful impact of false negatives. Moreover, leveraging the graph structure and few-labeled data, we perform semi-supervised consistency classification and enhance the representative ability of minority classes. We compared our method with the most popular time-series contrastive learning methods on four real-world time-series datasets and demonstrated our significant advantages in overall performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Bidirectional Generative Pre-training for Improving Healthcare Time-series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09558v3)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning time-series representations for discriminative tasks, such as classification and regression, has been a long-standing challenge in the healthcare domain. Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-light phase retrieval with implicit generative priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17745v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase retrieval (PR) is fundamentally important in scientific imaging and is crucial for nanoscale techniques like coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). Low radiation dose imaging is essential for applications involving radiation-sensitive samples. However, most PR methods struggle in low-dose scenarios due to high shot noise. Recent advancements in optical data acquisition setups, such as in-situ CDI, have shown promise for low-dose imaging, but they rely on a time series of measurements, making them unsuitable for single-image applications. Similarly, data-driven phase retrieval techniques are not easily adaptable to data-scarce situations. Zero-shot deep learning methods based on pre-trained and implicit generative priors have been effective in various imaging tasks but have shown limited success in PR. In this work, we propose low-dose deep image prior (LoDIP), which combines in-situ CDI with the power of implicit generative priors to address single-image low-dose phase retrieval. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate LoDIP's superior performance in this task and its applicability to real experimental scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

TRAM robustifies SLAM to recover the camera motion in the presence of dynamic humans and uses the scene background to derive the motion scale. Using the recovered camera as a metric-scale reference frame, we introduce a video transformer model (VIMO) to regress the kinematic body motion of a human.

In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2025.

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures; 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

Challenges associated to these tasks have created an interest in autonomous planning, navigation, and tracking technologies that operate with little ground-based intervention. This research introduces a trajectory planning tool for a low-thrust mobile observer, aimed at maximizing navigation and tracking performance with satellite-to-satellite relative measurements. We formulate an expression for the information gathered over an observation period based on the mutual information between augmented observer/target states and the associated measurement set collected. We then develop an optimal trajectory design problem for a mobile observer, balancing information gain and control effort, and solve this problem with a Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach. The developed methods are demonstrated in scenarios involving spacecraft in the cislunar regime, demonstrating the potential for improved autonomous navigation and tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |
| **[Traffic expertise meets residual RL: Knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning for CAV trajectory control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17380v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is anticipated to exhibit higher sample efficiency compared to model-free RL by utilizing a virtual environment model. However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

First, a novel multivariable fixed-time disturbance observer is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances. The bi-limit homogeneity and Lyapunov techniques are employed to ensure the convergence of estimation error within a fixed convergence time, independent of the initial estimation error. Then, an observerbased model predictive control strategy is formulated to achieve robust trajectory tracking of quadrotor, attenuating the lumped disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, simulations and real-world experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To this end, we provide a novel asynchronous spatial-temporal allocation method. Specifically, between a pair of agents, the allocation is proposed to determine their corresponding derivable time-stamped space and can be updated in an asynchronous way, by inserting a waiting duration between two consecutive replanning steps. Via theoretical analysis, the inter-agent collision is proved to be avoided and the allocation ensures timely updates. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons with five baselines validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate its improvement in completion time and moving distance. Finally, hardware experiments are carried out, where $8$ heterogeneous unmanned ground vehicles with onboard computation navigate in cluttered scenarios with high agility.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[Pre-training on Synthetic Driving Data for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10121v3)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accumulating substantial volumes of real-world driving data proves pivotal in the realm of trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving. Given the heavy reliance of current trajectory forecasting models on data-driven methodologies, we aim to tackle the challenge of learning general trajectory forecasting representations under limited data availability. We propose a pipeline-level solution to mitigate the issue of data scarcity in trajectory forecasting. The solution is composed of two parts: firstly, we adopt HD map augmentation and trajectory synthesis for generating driving data, and then we learn representations by pre-training on them. Specifically, we apply vector transformations to reshape the maps, and then employ a rule-based model to generate trajectories on both original and augmented scenes; thus enlarging the driving data without collecting additional real ones. To foster the learning of general representations within this augmented dataset, we comprehensively explore the different pre-training strategies, including extending the concept of a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) for trajectory forecasting. Without bells and whistles, our proposed pipeline-level solution is general, simple, yet effective: we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our data expansion and pre-training strategies, which outperform the baseline prediction model by large margins, e.g. 5.04%, 3.84% and 8.30% in terms of $MR_6$, $minADE_6$ and $minFDE_6$. The pre-training dataset and the codes for pre-training and fine-tuning are released at https://github.com/yhli123/Pretraining_on_Synthetic_Driving_Data_for_Trajectory_Prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for One-step Diffusion Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15991v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPER: Enhancing Career Trajectory Prediction using Temporal Knowledge Graph and Ternary Relationship](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15620v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of career trajectory prediction (CTP) aims to predict one's future employer or job position. While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions-i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geo-Llama: Leveraging LLMs for Human Mobility Trajectory Generation with Spatiotemporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13918v2)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating human mobility data is essential for various application domains, including transportation, urban planning, and epidemic control, since real data are often inaccessible to researchers due to expensive costs and privacy issues. Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Artifact Correction for Symmetric Multi-Linear Trajectory CT: Theory, Method, and Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15069v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For extending CT field-of-view to perform non-destructive testing, the Symmetric Multi-Linear trajectory Computed Tomography (SMLCT) has been developed as a successful example of non-standard CT scanning modes. However, inevitable geometric errors can cause severe artifacts in the reconstructed images. The existing calibration method for SMLCT is both crude and inefficient. It involves reconstructing hundreds of images by exhaustively substituting each potential error, and then manually identifying the images with the fewest geometric artifacts to estimate the final geometric errors for calibration. In this paper, we comprehensively and efficiently address the challenging geometric artifacts in SMLCT, , and the corresponding works mainly involve theory, method, and generalization. In particular, after identifying sensitive parameters and conducting some theory analysis of geometric artifacts, we summarize several key properties between sensitive geometric parameters and artifact characteristics. Then, we further construct mathematical relationships that relate sensitive geometric errors to the pixel offsets of reconstruction images with artifact characteristics. To accurately extract pixel bias, we innovatively adapt the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm, commonly used in sound processing, for our image registration task for each paired symmetric LCT. This adaptation leads to the design of a highly efficient rigid translation registration method. Simulation and physical experiments have validated the excellent performance of this work. Additionally, our results demonstrate significant generalization to common rotated CT and a variant of SMLCT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Visibility-Aware Trajectory Planning for Target Tracking in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06363v2)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target tracking has numerous significant civilian and military applications, and maintaining the visibility of the target plays a vital role in ensuring the success of the tracking task. Existing visibility-aware planners primarily focus on keeping the target within the limited field of view of an onboard sensor and avoiding obstacle occlusion. However, the negative impact of system uncertainty is often neglected, rendering the planners delicate to uncertainties in practice. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a real-time, non-myopic trajectory planner for visibility-aware and safe target tracking in the presence of system uncertainty. For more accurate target motion prediction, we introduce the concept of belief-space probability of detection (BPOD) to measure the predictive visibility of the target under stochastic robot and target states. An Extended Kalman Filter variant incorporating BPOD is developed to predict target belief state under uncertain visibility within the planning horizon. To reach real-time trajectory planning, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to uniformly calculate both BPOD and the chance-constrained collision risk by utilizing linearized signed distance function (SDF), and then design a two-stage strategy for lightweight calculation of SDF in sequential convex programming. Extensive simulation results with benchmark comparisons show the capacity of the proposed approach to robustly maintain the visibility of the target under high system uncertainty. The practicality of the proposed trajectory planner is validated by real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report for our conference paper in 2024 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap-a gap in generalization at comparable training loss-between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments Using Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

We further propose an approach to curate interaction-heavy scenarios from datasets. This curated data has two advantages: it provides a stronger learning signal to the interaction model, and facilitates generation of pseudo-labels for interaction-centric pretext tasks.

| **[Synergistic Multi-Agent Framework with Trajectory Learning for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09893v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in various natural language processing tasks. However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> |  |

Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2024). content may change prior to final publication</p></details> |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a screwdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Differentially Private Spatiotemporal Trajectory Synthesis with Retained Data Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12842v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories collected from GPS-enabled devices are of vital importance to many applications, such as urban planning and traffic analysis. Due to the privacy leakage concerns, many privacy-preserving trajectory publishing methods have been proposed. However, most of them could not strike a good balance between privacy protection and good data utility. In this paper, we propose DP-STTS, a differentially private spatiotemporal trajectory synthesizer with high data utility, which employs a model composed of a start spatiotemporal cube distribution and a 1-order Markov process. Specially, DP-STTS firstly discretizes the raw spatiotemporal trajectories into neighboring cubes, such that the model size is limited and the model's tolerance for noise could be enhanced. Then, a Markov process is utilized for the next location point picking. After adding noise under differential privacy (DP) to the model, synthetic trajectories that preserve essential spatial and temporal characteristics of the real trajectories are generated from the noisy model. Experiments on one real-life dataset demonstrate that DP-STTS provides good data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/Etherious72/DP-STTS.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Minimizing Movement Delay for Movable Antennas via Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12813v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movable antennas (MAs) have received increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability of antenna position adjustment to reconfigure wireless channels. However, moving MAs results in non-negligible delay, which may decrease the effective data transmission time. To reduce the movement delay, we study in this paper a new MA trajectory optimization problem. In particular, given the desired destination positions of multiple MAs, we aim to jointly optimize their associations with the initial MA positions and the trajectories for moving them from their respective initial to destination positions within a given two-dimensional (2D) region, such that the delay of antenna movement is minimized, subject to the inter-MA minimum distance constraints in the movement. However, this problem is a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that sequentially optimizes the MAs' position associations and trajectories, respectively. First, we relax the inter-MA distance constraints and optimally solve the resulted delay minimization problem. Next, we check if the obtained MA association and trajectory solutions satisfy the inter-MA distance constraints. If not satisfied, we then employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to adjust the MAs' trajectories until they satisfy the given constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory optimization method in reducing the movement delay as well as draw useful insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,6 figures, submit to GLOBECOM 2024 Workshop - IRAFWCC</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Shortsighted Navigation: Merging Best View Trajectory Planning with Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12513v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gathering visual information effectively to monitor known environments is a key challenge in robotics. To be as efficient as human surveyors, robotic systems must continuously collect observational data required to complete their survey task. Inspection personnel instinctively know to look at relevant equipment that happens to be ``along the way.'' In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for continuous long-horizon viewpoint planning, for ground robots, applied to tasks involving patrolling, monitoring or visual data gathering in known environments. Our approach to Long Horizon Viewpoint Planning (LHVP), enables the robot to autonomously navigate and collect environmental data optimizing for coverage over the horizon of the patrol. Leveraging a quadruped's mobility and sensory capabilities, our LHVP framework plans patrol paths that account for coupling the viewpoint planner for the arm camera with the mobile base's navigation planner. The viewpath optimization algorithm seeks a balance between comprehensive environmental coverage and dynamically feasible movements, thus ensuring prolonged and effective operation in scenarios including monitoring, security surveillance, and disaster response. We validate our approach through simulations and in the real world and show that our LHVP significantly outperforms naive patrolling methods in terms of area coverage generating information-gathering trajectories for the robot arm. Our results indicate a promising direction for the deployment of mobile robots in long-term, autonomous surveying, and environmental data collection tasks, highlighting the potential of intelligent robotic systems in challenging real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controllers while trading computational complexity.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |

A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Traditional automated driving systems recalculate the entire trajectory in a changing environment. Instead, a novel approach retains valid trajectory segments, minimizing the need for complete replanning and reducing changes to the original plan. This work introduces a trajectory repairing framework that calculates a feasible evasive trajectory while computing the Feasible Time-to-React (F-TTR), balancing the maintenance of the original plan with safety assurance. The framework employs a binary search algorithm to iteratively create repaired trajectories, guaranteeing both the safety and feasibility of the trajectory repairing result. In contrast to earlier approaches that separated the calculation of safety metrics from trajectory repairing, which resulted in unsuccessful plans for evasive maneuvers, our work has the anytime capability to provide both a Feasible Time-to-React and an evasive trajectory for further execution.</p></details> |  |

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted for the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |

A particularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks that degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper investigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The proposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals, exploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and symmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these attacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform, highlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and resilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats. Furthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state monitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a carefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect the presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer from biases, such as length of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different elements that are used to compute the proposed metrics.</p></details> |  |

The low-dimensional signals that capture internal brain states are useful for building brain machine interfaces and understanding the neural computation underlying meaningful behavior. We derive a practical upper bound to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inferred neural latent trajectories using Fisher information. We show that the SNR bound is proportional to the overdispersion factor and the Fisher information per neuron. Further numerical experiments show that inference methods that exploit the temporal regularities can achieve higher SNRs that are proportional to the bound.

| **[COTODE: COntinuous Trajectory neural Ordinary Differential Equations for modelling event sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observation of the underlying actors that generate event sequences reveals that they often evolve continuously. Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</p></details> |  |

Thus, early detection of traffic incidents is crucial for road users from safety perspectives with a potential to reduce the risk of secondary crashes. The wide availability of GPS devices now-a-days gives an opportunity of tracking and recording vehicle trajectories. The objective of this study is to use vehicle trajectory data for advance real-time detection of traffic incidents on highways using machine learning-based algorithms. The study uses three days of unevenly sequenced vehicle trajectory data and traffic incident data on I-10, one of the most crash-prone highways in Louisiana. Vehicle trajectories are converted to trajectories based on virtual detector locations to maintain spatial uniformity as well as to generate historical traffic data for machine learning algorithms. Trips matched with traffic incidents on the way are separated and along with other trips with similar spatial attributes are used to build a database for modeling. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Artificial Neural Network models are used to detect a trajectory that is likely to face an incident in the downstream road section. Results suggest that the Random Forest model achieves the best performance for predicting an incident with reasonable recall value and discrimination capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 4 Tables, 10 Figures</p></details> |

It is a fundamental problem in modern applications and the objects considered may be as diverse as locations in space, text documents, images, twitter messages, or trajectories of moving objects. In this paper we are motivated by the latter application. Trajectories are recorded movements of mobile objects such as vehicles, animals, public transportation, or parts of the human body. We propose a novel distance function called DistanceAvg to capture the similarity of such movements. To be practical, it is necessary to provide indexing for this distance measure. Fortunately we do not need to start from scratch. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Our function DistanceAvg is a metric. Although metric indexes have been studied for decades and many such structures are available, they do not offer the best performance with trajectories. In this paper we propose a new design, which outperforms the best existing indexes for kNN queries and is equally good for range queries. It is especially suitable for expensive distance functions as they occur in trajectory similarity search.

| **[Harmonious Group Choreography with Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06189v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating group choreography from music has gained attention in cultural entertainment and virtual reality, aiming to coordinate visually cohesive and diverse group movements. Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RALTPER: A Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner for Complex Environment with Gaussian Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05838v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner (RALTPER) for autonomous vehicles in complex environments characterized by Gaussian uncertainty. The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

| **[PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

| **[TrajFM: A Vehicle Trajectory Foundation Model for Region and Task Transferability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15251v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and powers real-world applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should transfer between different regions and tasks without retraining, thus improving computational efficiency and effectiveness with limited training data. However, a model's ability to transfer across regions is limited by the unique spatial features and POI arrangements of each region, which are closely linked to vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, achieving task transferability is challenging due to the differing generation schemes required for various tasks. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and still require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer. To address these challenges, we propose TrajFM, a vehicle trajectory foundation model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce STRFormer as the main learnable model within TrajFM. It integrates spatial, temporal, and POI modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in POI arrangements across regions and includes a learnable spatio-temporal Rotary position embedding module for handling spatial features. For task transferability, we propose a trajectory masking and recovery scheme. This scheme unifies the generation processes of various tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and sub-trajectories, allowing TrajFM to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Experiments on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFM.

Two phonological feature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are used to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques are compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a potential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture co-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique. We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of the dynamics of biological motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel methodology for trajectory forecasting based on state-space dynamic system modeling, which endows agents with models that have tangible physical implications. To enhance the precision of state estimations within the dynamic system, the paper also presents a novel modeling technique for control variables. This technique utilizes a newly introduced model, termed "Mixed Mamba," to derive initial control states, thereby improving the predictive accuracy of these variables. Moverover, the proposed approach ingeniously integrates graph neural networks with state-space models, effectively capturing the complexities of multi-agent interactions. This combination provides a robust and scalable framework for forecasting multi-agent trajectories across a range of scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this model outperforms several established benchmarks across various metrics and datasets, highlighting its significant potential to advance trajectory forecasting in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |
| **[Grasping Trajectory Optimization with Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05466v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new trajectory optimization method for robotic grasping based on a point-cloud representation of robots and task spaces. In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset.

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects.

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Trajectory Prediction with Multi-View Data Integration in Cooperative Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00374v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU. The code is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/xichennn/V2I_trajectory_prediction}.</p></details> |  |

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

| **[Analysis of Functional Insufficiencies and Triggering Conditions to Improve the SOTIF of an MPC-based Trajectory Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21569v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated and autonomous driving has made a significant technological leap over the past decade. In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

However, current graph interpretability algorithms tend to emphasize generality and often overlook biological significance, thereby limiting their applicability in predicting cancer drug responses. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc interpretability algorithm for cancer drug response prediction, CETExplainer, which incorporates a controllable edge-type-specific weighting mechanism. It considers the mutual information between subgraphs and predictions, proposing a structural scoring approach to provide fine-grained, biologically meaningful explanations for predictive models. We also introduce a method for constructing ground truth based on real-world datasets to quantitatively evaluate the proposed interpretability algorithm. Empirical analysis on the real-world dataset demonstrates that CETExplainer achieves superior stability and improves explanation quality compared to leading algorithms, thereby offering a robust and insightful tool for cancer drug prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Learning via Random Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14481v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are powerful tools for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Recent pre-computation-based HGNNs use one-time message passing to transform a heterogeneous graph into regular-shaped tensors, enabling efficient mini-batch training. Existing pre-computation-based HGNNs can be mainly categorized into two styles, which differ in how much information loss is allowed and efficiency. We propose a hybrid pre-computation-based HGNN, named Random Projection Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RpHGNN), which combines the benefits of one style's efficiency with the low information loss of the other style. To achieve efficiency, the main framework of RpHGNN consists of propagate-then-update iterations, where we introduce a Random Projection Squashing step to ensure that complexity increases only linearly. To achieve low information loss, we introduce a Relation-wise Neighbor Collection component with an Even-odd Propagation Scheme, which aims to collect information from neighbors in a finer-grained way. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on seven small and large benchmark datasets while also being 230% faster compared to the most effective baseline. Surprisingly, our approach not only surpasses pre-processing-based baselines but also outperforms end-to-end methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |
| **[Uplift Modeling Under Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19289v4)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects in e-commerce tends to involve costly treatment assignments which can be impractical in large-scale settings. Leveraging machine learning to predict such treatment effects without actual intervention is a standard practice to diminish the risk. However, existing methods for treatment effect prediction tend to rely on training sets of substantial size, which are built from real experiments and are thus inherently risky to create. In this work we propose a graph neural network to diminish the required training set size, relying on graphs that are common in e-commerce data. Specifically, we view the problem as node regression with a restricted number of labeled instances, develop a two-model neural architecture akin to previous causal effect estimators, and test varying message-passing layers for encoding. Furthermore, as an extra step, we combine the model with an acquisition function to guide the creation of the training set in settings with extremely low experimental budget. The framework is flexible since each step can be used separately with other models or treatment policies. The experiments on real large-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the state of the art, which in many cases performs close to random, underlining the need for models that can generalize with limited supervision to reduce experimental risks.</p></details> |  |

To leverage the approximation ability of neural networks, we proposed a general framework for optimizing and learning Nash equilibrium using neural networks to estimate players' cost functions. Depending on the availability of data, we propose two approaches (a) the two-stage approach: we need the data pair of players' strategy and relevant function value to first learn the players' cost functions by monotonic neural networks or graph neural networks, and then solve the Nash equilibrium with the learned neural networks; (b) the joint approach: we use the data of partial true observation of the equilibrium and contextual information (e.g., weather) to optimize and learn Nash equilibrium simultaneously. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with equilibrium constraints and solved using a modified Backpropagation Algorithm. The proposed methods are validated in numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an incomplete draft, we need to make more modifications</p></details> |

We explore how machine learning can accelerate this process by learning a scoring function with a functional form that allows for more rapid optimization. Specifically, we define the scoring function to be the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligand and protein scalar fields parameterized by equivariant graph neural networks, enabling rapid optimization over rigid-body degrees of freedom with fast Fourier transforms. The runtime of our approach can be amortized at several levels of abstraction, and is particularly favorable for virtual screening settings with a common binding pocket. We benchmark our scoring functions on two simplified docking-related tasks: decoy pose scoring and rigid conformer docking. Our method attains similar but faster performance on crystal structures compared to the widely-used Vina and Gnina scoring functions, and is more robust on computationally predicted structures. Code is available at https://github.com/bjing2016/scalar-fields.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

Yet, GNNs are often vulnerable to adversarial structural attacks as embedding generation relies on graph topology. Existing efforts are dedicated to purifying the maliciously modified structure or applying adaptive aggregation, thereby enhancing the robustness against adversarial structural attacks. It is inevitable for a defender to consume heavy computational costs due to lacking prior knowledge about modified structures. To this end, we propose an efficient defense method, called Simple and Fast Robust Graph Neural Network (SFR-GNN), supported by mutual information theory. The SFR-GNN first pre-trains a GNN model using node attributes and then fine-tunes it over the modified graph in the manner of contrastive learning, which is free of purifying modified structures and adaptive aggregation, thus achieving great efficiency gains. Consequently, SFR-GNN exhibits a 24%--162% speedup compared to advanced robust models, demonstrating superior robustness for node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network for Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00119v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of multi-modal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to analyze the genuine emotional state of each utterance based on the multi-modal information in the conversation, which is crucial for conversation understanding. Existing methods focus on using graph neural networks (GNN) to model conversational relationships and capture contextual latent semantic relationships. However, due to the complexity of GNN, existing methods cannot efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, which limits the performance of MERC. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) for multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. Specifically, we first use pre-extracted text, video and audio features as input to Bi-LSTM to capture contextual semantic information and obtain low-level utterance features. Then, we use low-level utterance features to construct a conversational emotion interaction graph. To efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, we use the dilated generalized forward push algorithm to precompute the emotional propagation between global utterances and design an emotional relation-aware operator to capture the potential semantic associations between different utterances. Furthermore, we combine early fusion and adaptive late fusion mechanisms to fuse latent dependency information between speaker relationship information and context. Finally, we obtain high-level discourse features and feed them into MLP for emotion prediction. Extensive experimental results show that ELR-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD, with running times reduced by 52\% and 35\%, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 tables |

The proposed methodology leverages graph-based representations to effectively capture the spatial distribution and relational intricacies inherent in this decentralized network structure. This research work offers a novel approach that extends beyond the conventional Generalized Additive Model framework by considering models like Graph Convolutional Networks or Graph SAGE. These graph-based models enable the incorporation of various levels of interconnectedness and information sharing among nodes, where each node corresponds to the combined load (i.e. consumption) of a subset of consumers (e.g. the regions of a country). More specifically, we introduce a range of methods for inferring graphs tailored to consumption forecasting, along with a framework for evaluating the developed models in terms of both performance and explainability. We conduct experiments on electricity forecasting, in both a synthetic and a real framework considering the French mainland regions, and the performance and merits of our approach are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, ECML PKDD 2024 Workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[Non-Homophilic Graph Pre-Training and Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12594v3)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex relationships between objects across various fields. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02606v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of applications where data dynamically evolves across spatial and temporal dimensions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often complemented by sequence modeling architectures, such as RNNs and transformers, to effectively model temporal changes. These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |

Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-SGANet: Hybrid Sparse Graph Attention Network for Deformable Medical Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16719v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) and Transformer has emerged as a strong candidate for image registration, leveraging the strengths of both models and a large parameter space. However, this hybrid model, treating brain MRI volumes as grid or sequence structures, faces challenges in accurately representing anatomical connectivity, diverse brain regions, and vital connections contributing to the brain's internal architecture. Concerns also arise regarding the computational expense and GPU memory usage associated with this model. To tackle these issues, a lightweight hybrid sparse graph attention network (H-SGANet) has been developed. This network incorporates a central mechanism, Sparse Graph Attention (SGA), based on a Vision Graph Neural Network (ViG) with predetermined anatomical connections. The SGA module expands the model's receptive field and seamlessly integrates into the network. To further amplify the advantages of the hybrid network, the Separable Self-Attention (SSA) is employed as an enhanced token mixer, integrated with depth-wise convolution to constitute SSAFormer. This strategic integration is designed to more effectively extract long-range dependencies. As a hybrid ConvNet-ViG-Transformer model, H-SGANet offers threefold benefits for volumetric medical image registration. It optimizes fixed and moving images concurrently through a hybrid feature fusion layer and an end-to-end learning framework. Compared to VoxelMorph, a model with a similar parameter count, H-SGANet demonstrates significant performance enhancements of 3.5% and 1.5% in Dice score on the OASIS dataset and LPBA40 dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16717v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last years, many neural network-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, GNNs are inherently not well suited to operate on dense graphs, such as in routing problems. Furthermore, models operating on Euclidean coordinates cannot be applied to non-Euclidean versions of routing problems that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel GNN-related edge-based neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). We evaluate the performance of GREAT in the edge-classification task to predict optimal edges in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We can use such a trained GREAT model to produce sparse TSP graph instances, keeping only the edges GREAT finds promising. Compared to other, non-learning-based methods to sparsify TSP graphs, GREAT can produce very sparse graphs while keeping most of the optimal edges. Furthermore, we build a reinforcement learning-based GREAT framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean asymmetric TSP. This framework achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Herein, we introduce Symplectic Graph Neural Networks (SympGNNs) that can effectively handle system identification in high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, as well as node classification. SympGNNs combines symplectic maps with permutation equivariance, a property of graph neural networks. Specifically, we propose two variants of SympGNNs: i) G-SympGNN and ii) LA-SympGNN, arising from different parameterizations of the kinetic and potential energy. We demonstrate the capabilities of SympGNN on two physical examples: a 40-particle coupled Harmonic oscillator, and a 2000-particle molecular dynamics simulation in a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of SympGNN in the node classification task, achieving accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art. We also empirically show that SympGNN can overcome the oversmoothing and heterophily problems, two key challenges in the field of graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

When deploying CDPRs in practice, the kinematic modeling is a key question. Unlike serial robots, CDPRs have a simple inverse kinematics problem but a complex forward kinematics (FK) issue. So, the development of accurate and efficient FK solvers has been a prominent research focus in CDPR applications. By observing the topology within CDPRs, in this paper, we propose a graph-based representation to model CDPRs and introduce CafkNet, a fast and general FK solving method, leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the topological structure and yield the real FK solutions with superior generality, high accuracy, and low time cost. CafkNet is extensively tested on 3D and 2D CDPRs in different configurations, both in simulators and real scenarios. The results demonstrate its ability to learn CDPRs' internal topology and accurately solve the FK problem. Then, the zero-shot generalization from one configuration to another is validated. Also, the sim2real gap can be bridged by CafkNet using both simulation and real-world data.

This paper presents a new type of graph attention network, called TempoKGAT, which combines time-decaying weight and a selective neighbor aggregation mechanism on the spatial domain, which helps uncover latent patterns in the graph data. In this approach, a top-k neighbor selection based on the edge weights is introduced to represent the evolving features of the graph data. We evaluated the performance of our TempoKGAT on multiple datasets from the traffic, energy, and health sectors involving spatio-temporal data. We compared the performance of our approach to several state-of-the-art methods found in the literature on several open-source datasets. Our method shows superior accuracy on all datasets.

We previously introduced a person-centric ontology to organize information about individual patients, and a representation learning framework to extract person-centric knowledge graphs (PKGs) and to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to examine the results of GNN models trained with both structured and unstructured information from the MIMIC-III dataset. Through ablation studies on different clinical, demographic, and social data, we show the robustness of this approach in identifying predictive features in PKGs for the task of readmission prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 34th Medical Informatics Europe Conference</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Topology-aware Data Augmentation for High-Degree Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05482v4)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a potent tool for learning on graph-structured data and won fruitful successes in varied fields. The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where representations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of its neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have dozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an efficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification. The former obtains augmented node features and enhanced model capacity by encoding the graph structure into high-quality structure embeddings with our highly-efficient sketching method. Further, by exploiting task-relevant features extracted from graph structures and attributes, the second module enables the accurate identification and reduction of numerous redundant/noisy edges from the input graph, thereby alleviating over-smoothing and facilitating faster feature aggregations over HDGs. Empirically, TADA considerably improves the predictive performance of mainstream GNN models on 8 real homophilic/heterophilic HDGs in terms of node classification, while achieving efficient training and inference processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report for the paper accepted to KDD 2024. 16 pages</p></details> |

High-entropy alloys (HEAs), however, lack chemical long-range order, limiting the applicability of current graph representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a representation of HEAs as a collection of local environment (LE) graphs. Based on this representation, we introduce the LESets machine learning model, an accurate, interpretable GNN for HEA property prediction. We demonstrate the accuracy of LESets in modeling the mechanical properties of quaternary HEAs. Through analyses and interpretation, we further extract insights into the modeling and design of HEAs. In a broader sense, LESets extends the potential applicability of GNNs to disordered materials with combinatorial complexity formed by diverse constituents and their flexible configurations.</p></details> |  |

This approach is particularly beneficial in privacy-sensitive scenarios and offers a new perspective on addressing scalability challenges in large-scale graph learning. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from practical applications, spanning various research backgrounds and experimental settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 38 graph datasets from 16 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the ability of FGL while also revealing its potential limitations, offering valuable insights for future exploration in this thriving field.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Mitigating Label Noise on Graph via Topological Sample Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01942v4)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of the carefully-annotated benchmarks, the effectiveness of existing graph neural networks (GNNs) can be considerably impaired in practice when the real-world graph data is noisily labeled. Previous explorations in sample selection have been demonstrated as an effective way for robust learning with noisy labels, however, the conventional studies focus on i.i.d data, and when moving to non-iid graph data and GNNs, two notable challenges remain: (1) nodes located near topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection. (2) there is no available measure that considers the graph topological information to promote sample selection in a graph. To address this dilemma, we propose a $\textit{Topological Sample Selection}$ (TSS) method that boosts the informative sample selection process in a graph by utilising topological information. We theoretically prove that our procedure minimizes an upper bound of the expected risk under target clean distribution, and experimentally show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Learning from Heterogeneity: A Dynamic Learning Framework for Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03411v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) has gained increasing popularity in recent years owing to its capability and flexibility in modeling complex graph structure data. Among all graph learning methods, hypergraph learning is a technique for exploring the implicit higher-order correlations when training the embedding space of the graph. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph learning framework named LFH that is capable of dynamic hyperedge construction and attentive embedding update utilizing the heterogeneity attributes of the graph. Specifically, in our framework, the high-quality features are first generated by the pairwise fusion strategy that utilizes explicit graph structure information when generating initial node embedding. Afterwards, a hypergraph is constructed through the dynamic grouping of implicit hyperedges, followed by the type-specific hypergraph learning process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several popular datasets with eleven state-of-the-art models on both node classification and link prediction tasks, which fall into categories of homogeneous pairwise graph learning, heterogeneous pairwise graph learning, and hypergraph learning. The experiment results demonstrate a significant performance gain (average 12.5% in node classification and 13.3% in link prediction) compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Data-Limited Graph Neural Networks by Actively Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13989v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are pervasive in the real-world, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have great ability in node classification, a fundamental task on graphs. Unfortunately, conventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes, despite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer learning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to exploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based methods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the quality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm to enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with considerably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 Figures |

Given that ST data consists of non-stationary and complex time events, interpreting and predicting such trends is comparatively complicated. Representation of ST data in modes helps us infer behavior and assess the impact of noise on prediction applications. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into modes using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method, which is then fed into the neural network for forecasting future states. This hybrid approach is known as a variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN). Instead of exhaustively searching for the number of modes, they are determined using the reconstruction loss from the real-time application data. We also study the significance of each mode and the impact of bandwidth constraints on different horizon predictions in traffic flow data. We evaluate the performance of our proposed network on the LargeST dataset for both short and long-term predictions. Our framework yields better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems Submission, 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Role of Fibration Symmetries in Geometric Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15894v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) unifies a broad class of machine learning techniques from the perspectives of symmetries, offering a framework for introducing problem-specific inductive biases like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the current formulation of GDL is limited to global symmetries that are not often found in real-world problems. We propose to relax GDL to allow for local symmetries, specifically fibration symmetries in graphs, to leverage regularities of realistic instances. We show that GNNs apply the inductive bias of fibration symmetries and derive a tighter upper bound for their expressive power. Additionally, by identifying symmetries in networks, we collapse network nodes, thereby increasing their computational efficiency during both inference and training of deep neural networks. The mathematical extension introduced here applies beyond graphs to manifolds, bundles, and grids for the development of models with inductive biases induced by local symmetries that can lead to better generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process Involving a Dynamic Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03469v2)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) have recently become increasingly interesting for learning dynamics in graph data. A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |
| **[Str-L Pose: Integrating Point and Structured Line for Relative Pose Estimation in Dual-Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15750v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relative pose estimation is crucial for various computer vision applications, including Robotic and Autonomous Driving. Current methods primarily depend on selecting and matching feature points prone to incorrect matches, leading to poor performance. Consequently, relying solely on point-matching relationships for pose estimation is a huge challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Geometric Correspondence Graph neural network that integrates point features with extra structured line segments. This integration of matched points and line segments further exploits the geometry constraints and enhances model performance across different environments. We employ the Dual-Graph module and Feature Weighted Fusion Module to aggregate geometric and visual features effectively, facilitating complex scene understanding. We demonstrate our approach through extensive experiments on the DeMoN and KITTI Odometry datasets. The results show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v3)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024</p></details> |
| **[Inferring Individual Direct Causal Effects Under Heterogeneous Peer Influence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17479v3)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference in networks should account for interference, which occurs when a unit's outcome is influenced by treatments or outcomes of peers. Heterogeneous peer influence (HPI) occurs when a unit's outcome is influenced differently by different peers based on their attributes and relationships, or when each unit has a different susceptibility to peer influence. Existing solutions to estimating direct causal effects under interference consider either homogeneous influence from peers or specific heterogeneous influence mechanisms (e.g., based on local neighborhood structure). This paper presents a methodology for estimating individual direct causal effects in the presence of HPI where the mechanism of influence is not known a priori. We propose a structural causal model for networks that can capture different possible assumptions about network structure, interference conditions, and causal dependence and enables reasoning about identifiability in the presence of HPI. We find potential heterogeneous contexts using the causal model and propose a novel graph neural network-based estimator to estimate individual direct causal effects. We show that state-of-the-art methods for individual direct effect estimation produce biased results in the presence of HPI, and that our proposed estimator is robust.</p></details> |  |

However, conflicts arising from different label spaces among datasets may adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically construct a unified label space across multiple datasets using graph neural networks. This enables semantic segmentation models to be trained simultaneously on multiple datasets, resulting in performance improvements. Unlike existing methods, our approach facilitates seamless training without the need for additional manual reannotation or taxonomy reconciliation. This significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-dataset segmentation model training. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other multi-dataset training methods when trained on seven datasets simultaneously, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildDash 2 benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to demystify the internal workings of these models and provide insightful perspectives into their decision-making processes. This is done by uncovering connections to two approximation algorithms studied in the domain of Boolean Satisfiability: Belief Propagation and Semidefinite Programming Relaxations. Revealing these connections has empowered us to introduce a suite of impactful enhancements. The first significant enhancement is a curriculum training procedure, which incrementally increases the problem complexity in the training set, together with increasing the number of message passing iterations of the Graph Neural Network. We show that the curriculum, together with several other optimizations, reduces the training time by more than an order of magnitude compared to the baseline without the curriculum. Furthermore, we apply decimation and sampling of initial embeddings, which significantly increase the percentage of solved problems.</p></details> | CIKM 2024 |

Existing methods primarily assess candidate publications from a static perspective, focusing on the content of articles and their structural information, such as citation relationships. There is a lack of research regarding how to account for the evolving impact among papers on their embeddings. Toward this goal, this paper introduces a temporal dimension to paper recommendation strategies. The core idea is to continuously update a paper's embedding when new citation relationships appear, enhancing its relevance for future recommendations. Whenever a citation relationship is added to the literature upon the publication of a paper, the embeddings of the two related papers are updated through a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGN). A learnable memory update module based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is utilized to study the evolution of the embedding of a paper in order to predict its reference impact in a future timestamp. Such a TGN-based model learns a pattern of how people's views of the paper may evolve, aiming to guide paper recommendations more precisely. Extensive experiments on an open citation network dataset, including 313,278 articles from https://paperswithcode.com/about PaperWithCode, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, accepted by SDU@AAAI-2024.

The problem of determining which part of the service fits within which domain is referred to as slice partitioning. The partitioning of multi-domain network slices poses a challenging problem, particularly when striving to strike the right balance between inter-domain and intra-domain costs, as well as ensuring optimal load distribution within each domain. To approach the optimal partition solution while maintaining load balance between domains, a framework has been proposed. This framework not only generates partition plans with various characteristics but also employs a Graph Neural Network solver, which significantly reduces the plan generation time. The proposed approach is promising in generating partition plans for multi-domain network slices and is expected to improve the overall performance of the network.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have demonstrated their superior performance across various applications, including medical analysis and recommendation systems, often surpassing existing methods. However, GPUs often experience inefficiencies when executing HGNNs due to their unique and complex execution patterns. Compared to traditional Graph Neural Networks, these patterns further exacerbate irregularities in memory access. To tackle these challenges, recent studies have focused on developing domain-specific accelerators for HGNNs. Nonetheless, most of these efforts have concentrated on optimizing the datapath or scheduling data accesses, while largely overlooking the potential benefits that could be gained from leveraging the inherent properties of the semantic graph, such as its topology, layout, and generation. In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance. First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation. Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN. This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts. Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\times$.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 18 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.04792</p></details> |

A set of requested observations must be scheduled on an agile Earth observation satellite while respecting constraints on their visibility window, as well as maneuver constraints that impose varying delays between successive observations. In addition, the problem is largely oversubscribed: there are much more candidate observations than what can possibly be achieved. Therefore, one must select the set of observations that will be performed while maximizing their weighted cumulative benefit, and propose a feasible schedule for these observations. As previous work mostly focused on heuristic and iterative search algorithms, this paper presents a new technique for selecting and scheduling observations based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). GNNs are used to extract relevant information from the graphs representing instances of the EOSP, and DRL drives the search for optimal schedules. Our simulations show that it is able to learn on small problem instances and generalize to larger real-world instances, with very competitive performance compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 17th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2024)</p></details> |

However, the graph-structured data, which is inherently rich in structural and domain-specific knowledge, has not yet been gracefully adapted to LLMs. Existing methods either describe the graph with raw text, suffering the loss of graph structural information, or feed Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings into LLMs at the cost of losing explainable prompt semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end modality-aligning framework for LLM-graph alignment: Dual-Residual Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder, namely Dr.E. Our approach is purposefully designed to facilitate token-level alignment with LLMs, enabling an effective translation of the intrinsic `language' of graphs into comprehensible natural language. We also manage to enhance LLMs' more robust structural understanding of graphs by incorporating multiple views of the central nodes based on their surrounding nodes at various distances. Our experimental evaluations on standard graph tasks demonstrate competitive performance against other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Additionally, our framework ensures certain visual interpretability, efficiency, and robustness, marking the promising successful endeavor to achieve token-level alignment between LLMs and GNNs.

However, due to data privacy concerns, this is often impractical when multi-parties are involved in recommender system training. Federated learning appears as an excellent solution to the data isolation and privacy problem. Recently, Graph neural network (GNN) is becoming a promising approach for federated recommender systems. However, a key challenge is to conduct embedding propagation while preserving the privacy of the graph structure. Few studies have been conducted on the federated GNN-based recommender system. Our study proposes the first vertical federated GNN-based recommender system, called VerFedGNN.

| **[XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16021v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Meta Flow Matching: Integrating Vector Fields on the Wasserstein Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14608v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous biological and physical processes can be modeled as systems of interacting entities evolving continuously over time, e.g. the dynamics of communicating cells or physical particles. Learning the dynamics of such systems is essential for predicting the temporal evolution of populations across novel samples and unseen environments. Flow-based models allow for learning these dynamics at the population level - they model the evolution of the entire distribution of samples. However, current flow-based models are limited to a single initial population and a set of predefined conditions which describe different dynamics. We argue that multiple processes in natural sciences have to be represented as vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold of probability densities. That is, the change of the population at any moment in time depends on the population itself due to the interactions between samples. In particular, this is crucial for personalized medicine where the development of diseases and their respective treatment response depends on the microenvironment of cells specific to each patient. We propose Meta Flow Matching (MFM), a practical approach to integrating along these vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold by amortizing the flow model over the initial populations. Namely, we embed the population of samples using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and use these embeddings to train a Flow Matching model. This gives MFM the ability to generalize over the initial distributions unlike previously proposed methods. We demonstrate the ability of MFM to improve prediction of individual treatment responses on a large scale multi-patient single-cell drug screen dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Uncertainty Estimation of Graph Neural Network Potentials Using Engineered Latent Space Distances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10844v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be astonishingly capable models for molecular property prediction, particularly as surrogates for expensive density functional theory calculations of relaxed energy for novel material discovery. However, one limitation of GNNs in this context is the lack of useful uncertainty prediction methods, as this is critical to the material discovery pipeline. In this work, we show that uncertainty quantification for relaxed energy calculations is more complex than uncertainty quantification for other kinds of molecular property prediction, due to the effect that structure optimizations have on the error distribution. We propose that distribution-free techniques are more useful tools for assessing calibration, recalibrating, and developing uncertainty prediction methods for GNNs performing relaxed energy calculations. We also develop a relaxed energy task for evaluating uncertainty methods for equivariant GNNs, based on distribution-free recalibration and using the Open Catalyst Project dataset. We benchmark a set of popular uncertainty prediction methods on this task, and show that latent distance methods, with our novel improvements, are the most well-calibrated and economical approach for relaxed energy calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that our latent space distance method produces results which align with our expectations on a clustering example, and on specific equation of state and adsorbate coverage examples from outside the training dataset.</p></details> |  |

Especially inductive GNNs, which allow for the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications. As such these networks become attractive targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing model-stealing attacks that extract models trained on images and texts. However, little attention has been given to stealing GNNs trained on graph data. This paper identifies a new method of performing unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, utilizing graph contrastive learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the targeted model. The new type of attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets and the results show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art by Shen et al. (2021). In particular, our attack surpasses the baseline across all benchmarks, attaining superior fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while necessitating fewer queries directed toward the target model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI - 27TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p></details> |

We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a much smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning aimed at minimizing the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |

In this context, Graph Neural Networks are promising due to their ability to learn from graph-structured data. Combined with Reinforcement Learning, they can serve as control approaches to determine remedial network actions. This review analyses how Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) can improve representation learning and decision making in power grid use cases. Although GRL has demonstrated adaptability to unpredictable events and noisy data, it is primarily at a proof-of-concept stage. We highlight open challenges and limitations with respect to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGPROMPT: Bridging Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Graphs for Few-shot Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01878v8)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) are prominent techniques for homogeneous and heterogeneous graph representation learning, yet their performance in an end-to-end supervised framework greatly depends on the availability of task-specific supervision. To reduce the labeling cost, pre-training on self-supervised pretext tasks has become a popular paradigm,but there is often a gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, stemming from the divergence in their objectives. To bridge the gap, prompt learning has risen as a promising direction especially in few-shot settings, without the need to fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. While there has been some early exploration of prompt-based learning on graphs, they primarily deal with homogeneous graphs, ignoring the heterogeneous graphs that are prevalent in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose HGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompting framework to unify not only pre-training and downstream tasks but also homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs via a dual-template design. Moreover, we propose dual-prompt in HGPROMPT to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant prior to bridge the gaps caused by not only feature variations but also heterogeneity differences across tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze HGPROMPT through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</p></details> | AAAI2024 main track |

To reduce labeling requirement, the "pre-train, prompt" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique for graph representation learning. However, their efficacy within an end-to-end supervised framework is significantly tied to the availabilityof task-specific labels. To mitigate labeling costs and enhance robustness in few-shot settings, pre-training on self-supervised tasks has emerged as a promising method, while prompting has been proposed to further narrow the objective gap between pretext and downstream tasks. Although there has been some initial exploration of prompt-based learning on graphs, they primarily leverage a single pretext task, resulting in a limited subset of general knowledge that could be learned from the pre-training data. Hence, in this paper, we propose MultiGPrompt, a novel multi-task pre-training and prompting framework to exploit multiple pretext tasks for more comprehensive pre-trained knowledge. First, in pre-training, we design a set of pretext tokens to synergize multiple pretext tasks. Second, we propose a dual-prompt mechanism consisting of composed and open prompts to leverage task-specific and global pre-training knowledge, to guide downstream tasks in few-shot settings. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MultiGPrompt.</p></details> | <details><summary>WWW20...</summary><p>WWW2024 research track</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14134v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are essential for various graph-based learning tasks. Notably, classical GNN architectures operate under the assumption of homophily, which posits that connected nodes are likely to share similar features. However, this assumption limits the effectiveness of GNNs in handling heterophilic graphs where connected nodes often exhibit dissimilar characteristics. Existing approaches for homophily graphs such as non-local neighbor extension and architectural refinement overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into these heterophilic contexts. With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is significant promise to enhance GNNs by leveraging the extensive open-world knowledge within LLMs to more effectively interpret and utilize textual data for characterizing heterophilic graphs. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. Specifically, in the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual information of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance GNNs for node classification on heterophilic graphs.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation for Dynamic Graph Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14523v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph modeling is crucial for analyzing evolving patterns in various applications. Existing approaches often integrate graph neural networks with temporal modules or redefine dynamic graph modeling as a generative sequence task. However, these methods typically rely on isolated historical contexts of the target nodes from a narrow perspective, neglecting occurrences of similar patterns or relevant cases associated with other nodes. In this work, we introduce the Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Graph Modeling (RAG4DyG) framework, which leverages guidance from contextually and temporally analogous examples to broaden the perspective of each node. This approach presents two critical challenges: (1) How to identify and retrieve high-quality demonstrations that are contextually and temporally analogous to dynamic graph samples? (2) How can these demonstrations be effectively integrated to improve dynamic graph modeling? To address these challenges, we propose RAG4DyG, which enriches the understanding of historical contexts by retrieving and learning from contextually and temporally pertinent demonstrations. Specifically, we employ a time- and context-aware contrastive learning module to identify and retrieve relevant cases for each query sequence. Moreover, we design a graph fusion strategy to integrate the retrieved cases, thereby augmenting the inherent historical contexts for improved prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of RAG4DyG for dynamic graph modeling.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[PAGE: Parametric Generative Explainer for Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14042v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces PAGE, a parameterized generative interpretive framework. PAGE is capable of providing faithful explanations for any graph neural network without necessitating prior knowledge or internal details. Specifically, we train the auto-encoder to generate explanatory substructures by designing appropriate training strategy. Due to the dimensionality reduction of features in the latent space of the auto-encoder, it becomes easier to extract causal features leading to the model's output, which can be easily employed to generate explanations. To accomplish this, we introduce an additional discriminator to capture the causality between latent causal features and the model's output. By designing appropriate optimization objectives, the well-trained discriminator can be employed to constrain the encoder in generating enhanced causal features. Finally, these features are mapped to substructures of the input graph through the decoder to serve as explanations. Compared to existing methods, PAGE operates at the sample scale rather than nodes or edges, eliminating the need for perturbation or encoding processes as seen in previous methods. Experimental results on both artificially synthesized and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only exhibits the highest faithfulness and accuracy but also significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies analyze the smoothing effect (separability) after message-passing (MP), depending on the expectation of node features. Regarding separability gain, they provided theoretical backgrounds on over-smoothing caused by various propagation schemes, including positive, signed, and blocked MPs. More recently, by extending these theorems, some works have suggested improvements in signed propagation under multiple classes. However, prior works assume that the error ratio of all propagation schemes is fixed, failing to investigate this phenomenon correctly. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method for estimating homophily and edge error ratio, integrated with dynamic selection between blocked and signed propagation during training. Our theoretical analysis, supported by extensive experiments, demonstrates that blocking MP can be more effective than signed propagation under high edge error ratios, improving the performance in both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of Graph Neural Networks is Robust to Model Mismatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13878v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various tasks supported by their generalization capabilities. However, the current analysis of GNN generalization relies on the assumption that training and testing data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). This imposes limitations on the cases where a model mismatch exists when generating testing data. In this paper, we examine GNNs that operate on geometric graphs generated from manifold models, explicitly focusing on scenarios where there is a mismatch between manifold models generating training and testing data. Our analysis reveals the robustness of the GNN generalization in the presence of such model mismatch. This indicates that GNNs trained on graphs generated from a manifold can still generalize well to unseen nodes and graphs generated from a mismatched manifold. We attribute this mismatch to both node feature perturbations and edge perturbations within the generated graph. Our findings indicate that the generalization gap decreases as the number of nodes grows in the training graph while increasing with larger manifold dimension as well as larger mismatch. Importantly, we observe a trade-off between the generalization of GNNs and the capability to discriminate high-frequency components when facing a model mismatch. The most important practical consequence of this analysis is to shed light on the filter design of generalizable GNNs robust to model mismatch. We verify our theoretical findings with experiments on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.05225</p></details> |

However, graph learning has predominantly focused on single-graph models, tailored to specific tasks or datasets, lacking the ability to transfer learned knowledge to different domains. This limitation stems from the inherent complexity and diversity of graph structures, along with the different feature and label spaces specific to graph data. In this paper, we recognize text as an effective unifying medium and employ Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) to leverage this potential. We present our UniGraph framework, designed to learn a foundation model for TAGs, which is capable of generalizing to unseen graphs and tasks across diverse domains. Unlike single-graph models that use pre-computed node features of varying dimensions as input, our approach leverages textual features for unifying node representations, even for graphs such as molecular graphs that do not naturally have textual features. We propose a novel cascaded architecture of Language Models (LMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbone networks. Additionally, we propose the first pre-training algorithm specifically designed for large-scale self-supervised learning on TAGs, based on Masked Graph Modeling. We introduce graph instruction tuning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable zero-shot prediction ability. Our comprehensive experiments across various graph learning tasks and domains demonstrate the model's effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning on unseen graphs, few-shot in-context transfer, and zero-shot transfer, even surpassing or matching the performance of GNNs that have undergone supervised training on target datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoCP-GNN: Robust Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Networks in Node-Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13825v1)** | 2024-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data. However, a notable limitation of GNNs is their inability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, which undermines their reliability in contexts where errors are costly. One way to address this issue is by providing prediction sets that contain the true label with a predefined probability margin. Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals. There are two primary challenges: first, given dependent data like graphs, it is unclear whether the critical assumption in CP - exchangeability - still holds when applied to node classification. Second, even if the exchangeability assumption is valid for conformalized link prediction, we need to ensure high efficiency, i.e., the resulting prediction set or the interval length is small enough to provide useful information. In this article, we propose a novel approach termed Robust Conformal Prediction for GNNs (RoCP-GNN), which integrates conformal prediction (CP) directly into the GNN training process. This method generates prediction sets, instead of just point predictions, that are valid at a user-defined confidence level, assuming only exchangeability. Our approach robustly predicts outcomes with any predictive GNN model while quantifying the uncertainty in predictions within the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models with size loss provide a statistically significant increase in performance. We validate our approach on standard graph benchmark datasets by coupling it with various state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification. The code will be made available after publication.</p></details> | 12, 5 figures |

While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |

Forecasting conversation derailment predicts signs of derailment in advance enabling proactive moderation of conversations. State-of-the-art approaches to conversation derailment forecasting sequentially encode conversations and use graph neural networks to model dialogue user dynamics. However, existing graph models are not able to capture complex conversational characteristics such as context propagation and emotional shifts. The use of common sense knowledge enables a model to capture such characteristics, thus improving performance. Following this approach, here we derive commonsense statements from a knowledge base of dialogue contextual information to enrich a graph neural network classification architecture. We fuse the multi-source information on utterance into capsules, which are used by a transformer-based forecaster to predict conversation derailment.

Supply chain data are inherently under graph structure; thus, it can be fertile ground for applications of graph neural network (GNN). Very recently, supply chain dataset, SupplyGraph, has been released to the public. Though the SupplyGraph dataset is valuable given scarcity of publicly available data, there was less clarity on description of the dataset, data quality assurance process, and hyperparameters of the selected models. Further, for generalizability of findings, it would be more convincing to present the findings by performing statistical analyses on the distribution of errors rather than showing the average value of the errors. Therefore, this study assessed the supply chain dataset, SupplyGraph, with better clarity on analyses processes, data quality assurance, machine learning (ML) model specifications. After data quality assurance procedures, this study compared performance of Multilayer Perceptions (MLP), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT) on a demanding forecasting task while matching hyperparameters as feasible as possible. The analyses revealed that GAT performed best, followed by GCN and MLP. Those performance improvements were statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ after correction for multiple comparisons. This study also discussed several considerations in applying GNN to supply chain networks. The current study reinforces the previous study in supply chain benchmark dataset with respect to description of the dataset and methodology, so that the future research in applications of GNN to supply chain becomes more reproducible.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Multivariate time series pose a complex challenge due to their feature and temporal dimensions. Traditional methods use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Transformers to analyze spatial while RNNs to model temporal dependencies. These methods focus narrowly on one dimension or engage in coarse-grained feature extraction, which can be inadequate for large datasets characterized by intricate relationships and dynamic changes. This paper introduces a novel temporal model built on an enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT) for multivariate time series anomaly detection called TopoGDN. Our model analyzes both time and feature dimensions from a fine-grained perspective. First, we introduce a multi-scale temporal convolution module to extract detailed temporal features. Additionally, we present an augmented GAT to manage complex inter-feature dependencies, which incorporates graph topology into node features across multiple scales, a versatile, plug-and-play enhancement that significantly boosts the performance of GAT. Our experimental results confirm that our approach surpasses the baseline models on four datasets, demonstrating its potential for widespread application in fields requiring robust anomaly detection.

In recent years, conceptual entities -- interpretable, language-independent features linked to external knowledge resources -- have been used in place of word-level tokens, as words typically require extensive language processing with a minimal assurance of interpretability. However, current literature is limited when it comes to exploring purely entity-driven neural topic modeling. For instance, despite the advantages of using entities for eliciting thematic structure, it is unclear whether current techniques are compatible with these sparsely organised, information-dense conceptual units. In this work, we explore entity-based neural topic modeling and propose a novel topic clustering approach using bimodal vector representations of entities. Concretely, we extract these latent representations from large language models and graph neural networks trained on a knowledge base of symbolic relations, in order to derive the most salient aspects of these conceptual units. Analysis of coherency metrics confirms that our approach is better suited to working with entities in comparison to state-of-the-art models, particularly when using graph-based embeddings trained on a knowledge base.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 1 figure.

However, they often suffer from fairness issues due to inherent biases in node attributes and graph structure, leading to unfair predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN framework, DAB-GNN, that Disentangles, Amplifies, and deBiases attribute, structure, and potential biases in the GNN mechanism. DAB-GNN employs a disentanglement and amplification module that isolates and amplifies each type of bias through specialized disentanglers, followed by a debiasing module that minimizes the distance between subgroup distributions to ensure fairness. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that DAB-GNN significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitors in terms of achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGNAS: Hardware-Aware Graph Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12840v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming increasingly popular for graph-based learning tasks such as point cloud processing due to their state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Nevertheless, the research community has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, lacking consideration of how to design efficient GNN models for edge scenarios with real-time requirements and limited resources. Examining existing GNN models reveals varied execution across platforms and frequent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) problems, highlighting the need for hardware-aware GNN design. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel hardware-aware graph neural architecture search framework tailored for resource constraint edge devices, namely HGNAS. To achieve hardware awareness, HGNAS integrates an efficient GNN hardware performance predictor that evaluates the latency and peak memory usage of GNNs in milliseconds. Meanwhile, we study GNN memory usage during inference and offer a peak memory estimation method, enhancing the robustness of architecture evaluations when combined with predictor outcomes. Furthermore, HGNAS constructs a fine-grained design space to enable the exploration of extreme performance architectures by decoupling the GNN paradigm. In addition, the multi-stage hierarchical search strategy is leveraged to facilitate the navigation of huge candidates, which can reduce the single search time to a few GPU hours. To the best of our knowledge, HGNAS is the first automated GNN design framework for edge devices, and also the first work to achieve hardware awareness of GNNs across different platforms. Extensive experiments across various applications and edge devices have proven the superiority of HGNAS. It can achieve up to a 10.6x speedup and an 82.5% peak memory reduction with negligible accuracy loss compared to DGCNN on ModelNet40.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Computers</p></details> |
| **[SIMPNet: Spatial-Informed Motion Planning Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12831v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robotic manipulators require fast and efficient motion-planning algorithms to operate in cluttered environments. State-of-the-art sampling-based motion planners struggle to scale to high-dimensional configuration spaces and are inefficient in complex environments. This inefficiency arises because these planners utilize either uniform or hand-crafted sampling heuristics within the configuration space. To address these challenges, we present the Spatial-informed Motion Planning Network (SIMPNet). SIMPNet consists of a stochastic graph neural network (GNN)-based sampling heuristic for informed sampling within the configuration space. The sampling heuristic of SIMPNet encodes the workspace embedding into the configuration space through a cross-attention mechanism. It encodes the manipulator's kinematic structure into a graph, which is used to generate informed samples within the framework of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We have evaluated the performance of SIMPNet using a UR5e robotic manipulator operating within simple and complex workspaces, comparing it against baseline state-of-the-art motion planners. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed planner compared to the baseline planners.</p></details> |  |

It must achieve high accuracy within the constraints of molecular mechanics' (MM) limited functional forms, which offers high computational efficiency. With the rapid expansion of synthetically accessible chemical space, traditional look-up table approaches face significant challenges. In this study, we address this issue using a modern data-driven approach, developing ByteFF, an Amber-compatible force field for drug-like molecules. To create ByteFF, we generated an expansive and highly diverse molecular dataset at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/DZVP level of theory. This dataset includes 2.4 million optimized molecular fragment geometries with analytical Hessian matrices, along with 3.2 million torsion profiles. We then trained an edge-augmented, symmetry-preserving molecular graph neural network (GNN) on this dataset, employing a carefully optimized training strategy. Our model predicts all bonded and non-bonded MM force field parameters for drug-like molecules simultaneously across a broad chemical space. ByteFF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, excelling in predicting relaxed geometries, torsional energy profiles, and conformational energies and forces. Its exceptional accuracy and expansive chemical space coverage make ByteFF a valuable tool for multiple stages of computational drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>ByteF...</summary><p>ByteFF, a machine learning parametrized MMFF</p></details> |

However, measuring, and simulating protein dynamics is challenging and time-consuming. While machine learning holds promise in deciphering the determinants of protein dynamics from structural information, most existing methods for protein representation learning operate at the residue level, ignoring the finer details of atomic interactions. In this work, we propose for the first time to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn protein representations at the atomic level and predict B-factors from protein 3D structures. The B-factor reflects the atomic displacement of atoms in proteins, and can serve as a surrogate for protein flexibility. We compared different GNN architectures to assess their performance. The Meta-GNN model achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.71 on a large and diverse test set of over 4k proteins (17M atoms) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), outperforming previous methods by a large margin. Our work demonstrates the potential of representations learned by GNNs for protein flexibility prediction and other related tasks.</p></details> |  |

Notably, their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Our study presents a novel method to enhance the expressivity of GNNs by embedding induced subgraphs into the graph Laplacian matrix's eigenbasis. We introduce a Learnable Lanczos algorithm with Linear Constraints (LLwLC), proposing two novel subgraph extraction strategies: encoding vertex-deleted subgraphs and applying Neumann eigenvalue constraints. For the former, we conjecture that LLwLC establishes a universal approximator, offering efficient time complexity. The latter focuses on link representations enabling differentiation between $k$-regular graphs and node automorphism, a vital aspect for link prediction tasks. Our approach results in an extremely lightweight architecture, reducing the need for extensive training datasets. Empirically, our method improves performance in challenging link prediction tasks across benchmark datasets, establishing its practical utility and supporting our theoretical findings. Notably, LLwLC achieves 20x and 10x speedup by only requiring 5% and 10% data from the PubMed and OGBL-Vessel datasets while comparing to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Despite their efficacy, similar to other deep learning models, GNNs are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Even minor perturbations in graph data can induce substantial alterations in model predictions. While existing research has explored various adversarial defense techniques for GNNs, the challenge of defending against adversarial attacks on real-world scale graph data remains largely unresolved. On one hand, methods reliant on graph purification and preprocessing tend to excessively emphasize local graph information, leading to sub-optimal defensive outcomes. On the other hand, approaches rooted in graph structure learning entail significant time overheads, rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose a new defense method named Talos, which enhances the global, rather than local, homophily of graphs as a defense. Experiments show that the proposed approach notably outperforms state-of-the-art defense approaches, while imposing little computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flexible, Equivariant Framework for Subgraph GNNs via Graph Products and Graph Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09291v3)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph Graph Neural Networks (Subgraph GNNs) enhance the expressivity of message-passing GNNs by representing graphs as sets of subgraphs. They have shown impressive performance on several tasks, but their complexity limits applications to larger graphs. Previous approaches suggested processing only subsets of subgraphs, selected either randomly or via learnable sampling. However, they make suboptimal subgraph selections or can only cope with very small subset sizes, inevitably incurring performance degradation. This paper introduces a new Subgraph GNNs framework to address these issues. We employ a graph coarsening function to cluster nodes into super-nodes with induced connectivity. The product between the coarsened and the original graph reveals an implicit structure whereby subgraphs are associated with specific sets of nodes. By running generalized message-passing on such graph product, our method effectively implements an efficient, yet powerful Subgraph GNN. Controlling the coarsening function enables meaningful selection of any number of subgraphs while, contrary to previous methods, being fully compatible with standard training techniques. Notably, we discover that the resulting node feature tensor exhibits new, unexplored permutation symmetries. We leverage this structure, characterize the associated linear equivariant layers and incorporate them into the layers of our Subgraph GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple graph learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, as it can seamlessly handle any number of subgraphs, while consistently outperforming baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

Mainstream molecular representation learning approaches are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, these approaches struggle with three significant challenges: insufficient annotations, molecular diversity, and architectural limitations such as over-squashing, which leads to the loss of critical structural details. To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of GNNs that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), known for their robust data-fitting capabilities and high accuracy in small-scale AI + Science tasks. By incorporating KANs into GNNs, our model enhances the representation of molecular structures. We further advance this approach with a variant called SwallowKAN (SKAN), which employs adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as the core of the non-linear neurons. This innovation improves both computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse molecular structures. Building on the strengths of SKAN, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-SKAN, and its augmented variant, GNN-SKAN+, which incorporates a SKAN-based classifier to further boost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate KANs into GNN architectures tailored for molecular representation learning. Experiments across 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot learning datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and computational cost.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Fair Augmentation for Graph Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12208v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in recommendation have harnessed the collaborative power of graph neural networks (GNNs) in learning users' preferences from user-item networks. Despite emerging regulations addressing fairness of automated systems, unfairness issues in graph collaborative filtering remain underexplored, especially from the consumer's perspective. Despite numerous contributions on consumer unfairness, only a few of these works have delved into GNNs. A notable gap exists in the formalization of the latest mitigation algorithms, as well as in their effectiveness and reliability on cutting-edge models. This paper serves as a solid response to recent research highlighting unfairness issues in graph collaborative filtering by reproducing one of the latest mitigation methods. The reproduced technique adjusts the system fairness level by learning a fair graph augmentation. Under an experimental setup based on 11 GNNs, 5 non-GNN models, and 5 real-world networks across diverse domains, our investigation reveals that fair graph augmentation is consistently effective on high-utility models and large datasets. Experiments on the transferability of the fair augmented graph open new issues for future recommendation studies. Source code: https://github.com/jackmedda/FA4GCF.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive source graphs could be unavailable in real-world scenarios due to privacy and storage concerns. To this end, we investigate an underexplored yet practical problem of source-free graph domain adaptation, which transfers knowledge from source models instead of source graphs to a target domain. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel GNN-based approach called Rank and Align (RNA), which ranks graph similarities with spectral seriation for robust semantics learning, and aligns inharmonic graphs with harmonic graphs which close to the source domain for subgraph extraction. In particular, to overcome label scarcity, we employ the spectral seriation algorithm to infer the robust pairwise rankings, which can guide semantic learning using a similarity learning objective. To depict distribution shifts, we utilize spectral clustering and the silhouette coefficient to detect harmonic graphs, which the source model can easily classify. To reduce potential domain discrepancy, we extract domain-invariant subgraphs from inharmonic graphs by an adversarial edge sampling process, which guides the invariant learning of GNNs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RNA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IJCAI2024</p></details> |
| **[Behavior Pattern Mining-based Multi-Behavior Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12152v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-behavior recommendation systems enhance effectiveness by leveraging auxiliary behaviors (such as page views and favorites) to address the limitations of traditional models that depend solely on sparse target behaviors like purchases. Existing approaches to multi-behavior recommendations typically follow one of two strategies: some derive initial node representations from individual behavior subgraphs before integrating them for a comprehensive profile, while others interpret multi-behavior data as a heterogeneous graph, applying graph neural networks to achieve a unified node representation. However, these methods do not adequately explore the intricate patterns of behavior among users and items. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel algorithm called Behavior Pattern mining-based Multi-behavior Recommendation (BPMR). Our method extensively investigates the diverse interaction patterns between users and items, utilizing these patterns as features for making recommendations. We employ a Bayesian approach to streamline the recommendation process, effectively circumventing the challenges posed by graph neural network algorithms, such as the inability to accurately capture user preferences due to over-smoothing. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that BPMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, showing an average improvement of 268.29% in Recall@10 and 248.02% in NDCG@10 metrics. The code of our BPMR is openly accessible for use and further research at https://github.com/rookitkitlee/BPMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Node classification in networks via simplicial interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10114v2)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the node classification task, it is natural to presume that densely connected nodes tend to exhibit similar attributes. Given this, it is crucial to first define what constitutes a dense connection and to develop a reliable mathematical tool for assessing node cohesiveness. In this paper, we propose a probability-based objective function for semi-supervised node classification that takes advantage of higher-order networks' capabilities. The proposed function reflects the philosophy aligned with the intuition behind classifying within higher order networks, as it is designed to reduce the likelihood of nodes interconnected through higher-order networks bearing different labels. Additionally, we propose the Stochastic Block Tensor Model (SBTM) as a graph generation model designed specifically to address a significant limitation of the traditional stochastic block model, which does not adequately represent the distribution of higher-order structures in real networks. We evaluate the objective function using networks generated by the SBTM, which include both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Furthermore, we present an approach that integrates the objective function with graph neural network (GNN)-based semi-supervised node classification methodologies, aiming for additional performance gains. Our results demonstrate that in challenging classification scenarios-characterized by a low probability of homo-connections, a high probability of hetero-connections, and limited prior node information-models based on the higher-order network outperform pairwise interaction-based models. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that integrating our proposed objective function with existing GNN-based node classification approaches enhances classification performance by efficiently learning higher-order structures distributed in the network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Partial Label Learning with Potential Cause Discovering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11449v3)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered widespread attention for their potential to address the challenges posed by graph representation learning, which face complex graph-structured data across various domains. However, due to the inherent complexity and interconnectedness of graphs, accurately annotating graph data for training GNNs is extremely challenging. To address this issue, we have introduced Partial Label Learning (PLL) into graph representation learning. PLL is a critical weakly supervised learning problem where each training instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, including the ground-truth label and the additional interfering labels. PLL allows annotators to make errors, which reduces the difficulty of data labeling. Subsequently, we propose a novel graph representation learning method that enables GNN models to effectively learn discriminative information within the context of PLL. Our approach utilizes potential cause extraction to obtain graph data that holds causal relationships with the labels. By conducting auxiliary training based on the extracted graph data, our model can effectively eliminate the interfering information in the PLL scenario. We support the rationale behind our method with a series of theoretical analyses. Moreover, we conduct extensive evaluations and ablation studies on multiple datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures. These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024. Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes. Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams. In the earthquake case, the resultant MultiFoundationQuake model achieves the best overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Intriguingly, from the observation of heterophilous data, we notice that certain high-order information exhibits higher homophily, which motivates us to involve high-order information in node representation learning. However, common practices in GNNs to acquire high-order information mainly through increasing model depth and altering message-passing mechanisms, which, albeit effective to a certain extent, suffer from three shortcomings: 1) over-smoothing due to excessive model depth and propagation times; 2) high-order information is not fully utilized; 3) low computational efficiency. In this regard, we design a similarity-based path sampling strategy to capture smooth paths containing high-order homophily. Then we propose a lightweight model based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), named PathMLP, which can encode messages carried by paths via simple transformation and concatenation operations, and effectively learn node representations in heterophilous graphs through adaptive path aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on 16 out of 20 datasets, underlining its effectiveness and superiority in alleviating the heterophily problem. In addition, our method is immune to over-smoothing and has high computational efficiency.

As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance. Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure. Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance. To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN). Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured. Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2024 in the reproducibility track. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.10778</p></details> |
| **[Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on the attention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist in leveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper link predictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. We will implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcase benchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Federated Graph Learning with Inherent Structural Knowledge and Dual-Densely Connected GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11662v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging technology that enables clients to collaboratively train powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner without exposing their private data. Nevertheless, FGL still faces the challenge of the severe non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of graphs, which possess diverse node and edge structures, especially across varied domains. Thus, exploring the knowledge inherent in these structures becomes significantly crucial. Existing methods, however, either overlook the inherent structural knowledge in graph data or capture it at the cost of significantly increased resource demands (e.g., FLOPs and communication bandwidth), which can be detrimental to distributed paradigms. Inspired by this, we propose FedDense, a novel FGL framework that optimizes the utilization efficiency of inherent structural knowledge. To better acquire knowledge of diverse and underexploited structures, FedDense first explicitly encodes the structural knowledge inherent within graph data itself alongside node features. Besides, FedDense introduces a Dual-Densely Connected (DDC) GNN architecture that exploits the multi-scale (i.e., one-hop to multi-hop) feature and structure insights embedded in the aggregated feature maps at each layer. In addition to the exploitation of inherent structures, we consider resource limitations in FGL, devising exceedingly narrow layers atop the DDC architecture and adopting a selective parameter sharing strategy to reduce resource costs substantially. We conduct extensive experiments using 15 datasets across 4 different domains, demonstrating that FedDense consistently surpasses baselines by a large margin in training performance, while demanding minimal resources.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |

Therefore, to enhance the scalability of GNN training, some studies have proposed sampling-based mini-batch training and distributed graph learning. However, these methods still have drawbacks, such as performance degradation and heavy communication. This paper introduces SliceGCN, a feature-sliced distributed large-scale graph learning method. SliceGCN slices the node features, with each computing device, i.e., GPU, handling partial features. After each GPU processes its share, partial representations are obtained and concatenated to form complete representations, enabling a single GPU's memory to handle the entire graph structure. This aims to avoid the accuracy loss typically associated with mini-batch training (due to incomplete graph structures) and to reduce inter-GPU communication during message passing (the forward propagation process of GNNs). To study and mitigate potential accuracy reductions due to slicing features, this paper proposes feature fusion and slice encoding. Experiments were conducted on six node classification datasets, yielding some interesting analytical results. These results indicate that while SliceGCN does not enhance efficiency on smaller datasets, it does improve efficiency on larger datasets. Additionally, we found that SliceGCN and its variants have better convergence, feature fusion and slice encoding can make training more stable, reduce accuracy fluctuations, and this study also discovered that the design of SliceGCN has a potentially parameter-efficient nature.</p></details> |  |

Many algorithms have been proposed to estimate causal effects involving network data, particularly peer effects, but they often overlook the variety of peer effects. To address this issue, we propose a general setting which considers both peer direct effects and peer indirect effects, and the effect of an individual's own treatment, and provide identification conditions of these causal effects and proofs. To estimate these causal effects, we utilize attention mechanisms to distinguish the influences of different neighbors and explore high-order neighbor effects through multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). Additionally, to control the dependency between node features and representations, we incorporate the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) into the GNN, fully utilizing the structural information of the graph, to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. Extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Our theoretical findings have the potential to improve intervention strategies in networked systems, with applications in areas such as social networks and epidemiology.</p></details> | AAAI |
| **[Logical Distillation of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07126v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a logic based interpretable model for learning on graphs and an algorithm to distill this model from a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Recent results have shown connections between the expressivity of GNNs and the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers (C2). We introduce a decision-tree based model which leverages an extension of C2 to distill interpretable logical classifiers from GNNs. We test our approach on multiple GNN architectures. The distilled models are interpretable, succinct, and attain similar accuracy to the underlying GNN. Furthermore, when the ground truth is expressible in C2, our approach outperforms the GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the Proceedings of KR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Classification via Reference Distribution Learning: Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11370v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph classification is a challenging problem owing to the difficulty in quantifying the similarity between graphs or representing graphs as vectors, though there have been a few methods using graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph kernels often suffer from computational costs and manual feature engineering, while GNNs commonly utilize global pooling operations, risking the loss of structural or semantic information. This work introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), an efficient and accurate graph classification method. GRDL treats each graph's latent node embeddings given by GNN layers as a discrete distribution, enabling direct classification without global pooling, based on maximum mean discrepancy to adaptively learned reference distributions. To fully understand this new model (the existing theories do not apply) and guide its configuration (e.g., network architecture, references' sizes, number, and regularization) for practical use, we derive generalization error bounds for GRDL and verify them numerically. More importantly, our theoretical and numerical results both show that GRDL has a stronger generalization ability than GNNs with global pooling operations. Experiments on moderate-scale and large-scale graph datasets show the superiority of GRDL over the state-of-the-art, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency, being at least 10 times faster than leading competitors in both training and inference stages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming with Neurosymbolic Inference and Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11367v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many inductive logic programming (ILP) methods are incapable of learning programs from probabilistic background knowledge, e.g. coming from sensory data or neural networks with probabilities. We propose Propper, which handles flawed and probabilistic background knowledge by extending ILP with a combination of neurosymbolic inference, a continuous criterion for hypothesis selection (BCE) and a relaxation of the hypothesis constrainer (NoisyCombo). For relational patterns in noisy images, Propper can learn programs from as few as 8 examples. It outperforms binary ILP and statistical models such as a Graph Neural Network.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Node Level Graph Autoencoder: Unified Pretraining for Textual Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07091v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Textual graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, featuring rich text information with complex relationships, which enables advanced research across various fields. Textual graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional feature embeddings from textual graphs that can improve the performance of downstream tasks. A high-quality feature embedding should effectively capture both the structural and the textual information in a textual graph. However, most textual graph dataset benchmarks rely on word2vec techniques to generate feature embeddings, which inherently limits their capabilities. Recent works on textual graph representation learning can be categorized into two folds: supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods finetune a language model on labeled nodes, which have limited capabilities when labeled data is scarce. Unsupervised methods, on the other hand, extract feature embeddings by developing complex training pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified unsupervised learning autoencoder framework, named Node Level Graph AutoEncoder (NodeGAE). We employ language models as the backbone of the autoencoder, with pretraining on text reconstruction. Additionally, we add an auxiliary loss term to make the feature embeddings aware of the local graph structure. Our method maintains simplicity in the training process and demonstrates generalizability across diverse textual graphs and downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on two core graph representation learning downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of diverse graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple textual graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
