| **[Towards Time Series Reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11376v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled numerous advances in understanding and reasoning in domains like vision, but we have not yet seen this broad success for time-series. Although prior works on time-series MLLMs have shown promising performance in time-series forecasting, very few works show how an LLM could be used for time-series reasoning in natural language. We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths. We show that our model learns a latent representation that reflects specific time-series features (e.g. slope, frequency), as well as outperforming GPT-4o on a set of zero-shot reasoning tasks on a variety of domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation at 2024 NeurIPS Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models</p></details> |
| **[Likelihood Based Inference for ARMA Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01198v5)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are widely used for analyzing time series data. However, standard likelihood-based inference methodology for ARMA models has avoidable limitations. We show that common ARMA likelihood maximization strategies often lead to sub-optimal parameter estimates. While this possibility has been previously identified, no routinely applicable algorithm has been developed to resolve the issue. We introduce a novel random initialization algorithm, designed to take advantage of the structure of the ARMA likelihood function, which overcomes these optimization problems. Additionally, we show that profile confidence intervals provide superior confidence intervals to those based on the Fisher information matrix. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a data analysis example and a series of simulation studies. This work makes a significant contribution to statistical practice by identifying and resolving under-recognized shortcomings of existing procedures that frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The developmental version of the R package used in this paper is available at the following GitHub repository: git@github.com:jeswheel/arima2.git</p></details> |
| **[Coherent forecast combination for linearly constrained multiple time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03429v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linearly constrained multiple time series may be encountered in many practical contexts, such as the National Accounts (e.g., GDP disaggregated by Income, Expenditure and Output), and multilevel frameworks where the variables are organized according to hierarchies or groupings, like the total energy consumption of a country disaggregated by region and energy sources. In these cases, when multiple incoherent base forecasts for each individual variable are available, a forecast combination-and-reconciliation approach, that we call coherent forecast combination, may be used to improve the accuracy of the base forecasts and achieve coherence in the final result. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based technique that combines multiple unbiased base forecasts while assuring the constraints valid for the series. We present closed form expressions for the coherent combined forecast vector and its error covariance matrix in the general case where a different number of forecasts is available for each variable. We also discuss practical issues related to the covariance matrix that is part of the optimal solution. Through simulations and a forecasting experiment on the daily Australian electricity generation hierarchical time series, we show that the proposed methodology, in addition to adhering to sound statistical principles, may yield in significant improvement on base forecasts, single-task combination and single-expert reconciliation approaches as well.</p></details> |  |

| **[Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03195v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference Research (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[TGS: Trajectory Generation and Selection using Vision Language Models in Mapless Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02454v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-modal trajectory generation and selection algorithm for real-world mapless outdoor navigation in human-centered environments. Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Trajectory Classification and Landmark Inference on Simplicial Complexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03145v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of classifying trajectories on a discrete or discretised 2-dimensional manifold modelled by a simplicial complex. Previous works have proposed to project the trajectories into the harmonic eigenspace of the Hodge Laplacian, and then cluster the resulting embeddings. However, if the considered space has vanishing homology (i.e., no "holes"), then the harmonic space of the 1-Hodge Laplacian is trivial and thus the approach fails. Here we propose to view this issue akin to a sensor placement problem and present an algorithm that aims to learn "optimal holes" to distinguish a set of given trajectory classes. Specifically, given a set of labelled trajectories, which we interpret as edge-flows on the underlying simplicial complex, we search for 2-simplices whose deletion results in an optimal separation of the trajectory labels according to the corresponding spectral embedding of the trajectories into the harmonic space. Finally, we generalise this approach to the unsupervised setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at the 58th Annual Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2024</p></details> |
| **[Social-Transmotion: Promptable Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16168v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-transmotion.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |
| **[Pairwise Spatiotemporal Partial Trajectory Matching for Co-movement Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02879v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal pairwise movement analysis involves identifying shared geographic-based behaviors between individuals within specific time frames. Traditionally, this task relies on sequence modeling and behavior analysis techniques applied to tabular or video-based data, but these methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture partial matching. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pairwise spatiotemporal partial trajectory matching that transforms tabular spatiotemporal data into interpretable trajectory images based on specified time windows, allowing for partial trajectory analysis. This approach includes localization of trajectories, checking for spatial overlap, and pairwise matching using a Siamese Neural Network. We evaluate our method on a co-walking classification task, demonstrating its effectiveness in a novel co-behavior identification application. Our model surpasses established methods, achieving an F1-score up to 0.73. Additionally, we explore the method's utility for pair routine pattern analysis in real-world scenarios, providing insights into the frequency, timing, and duration of shared behaviors. This approach offers a powerful, interpretable framework for spatiotemporal behavior analysis, with potential applications in social behavior research, urban planning, and healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission. 17 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Motion Prompting: Controlling Video Generation with Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02700v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion control is crucial for generating expressive and compelling video content; however, most existing video generation models rely mainly on text prompts for control, which struggle to capture the nuances of dynamic actions and temporal compositions. To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

| **[Resonance: Learning to Predict Social-Aware Pedestrian Trajectories as Co-Vibrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02447v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to forecast the trajectories of intelligent agents like pedestrians has caught more researchers' attention. Despite researchers' efforts, it remains a challenge to accurately account for social interactions among agents when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate such social modifications to future trajectories in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by the resonance phenomenon of vibration systems, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to forecast pedestrian trajectories as co-vibrations, and regard that social interactions are associated with spectral properties of agents' trajectories. It forecasts future trajectories as three distinct vibration terms to represent agents' future plans from different perspectives in a decoupled way. Also, agents' social interactions and how they modify scheduled trajectories will be considered in a resonance-like manner by learning the similarities of their trajectory spectrums. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrian or vehicle, have verified the usefulness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Walks With You Matters: Perceiving Social Interactions with Groups for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02395v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and anticipating human movement has become more critical and challenging in diverse applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance. The complex interactions brought by different relations between agents are a crucial reason that poses challenges to this task. Researchers have put much effort into designing a system using rule-based or data-based models to extract and validate the patterns between pedestrian trajectories and these interactions, which has not been adequately addressed yet. Inspired by how humans perceive social interactions with different level of relations to themself, this work proposes the GrouP ConCeption (short for GPCC) model composed of the Group method, which categorizes nearby agents into either group members or non-group members based on a long-term distance kernel function, and the Conception module, which perceives both visual and acoustic information surrounding the target agent. Evaluated across multiple datasets, the GPCC model demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory prediction accuracy, validating its effectiveness in modeling both social and individual dynamics. The qualitative analysis also indicates that the GPCC framework successfully leverages grouping and perception cues human-like intuitively to validate the proposed model's explainability in pedestrian trajectory forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, submitted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-based Road Autolabeling with Lidar-Camera Fusion in Winter Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02370v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust road segmentation in all road conditions is required for safe autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes. The source code is available at https://github.com/eerik98/lidar-camera-road-autolabeling.git</p></details> |  |
| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v3)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Latent Goal by Learning from Trajectory Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02125v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A glowing body of work has emerged focusing on instruction-following policies for open-world agents, aiming to better align the agent's behavior with human intentions. However, the performance of these policies is highly susceptible to the initial prompt, which leads to extra efforts in selecting the best instructions. We propose a framework named Preference Goal Tuning (PGT). PGT allows an instruction following policy to interact with the environment to collect several trajectories, which will be categorized into positive and negative samples based on preference. Then we use preference learning to fine-tune the initial goal latent representation with the categorized trajectories while keeping the policy backbone frozen. The experiment result shows that with minimal data and training, PGT achieves an average relative improvement of 72.0% and 81.6% over 17 tasks in 2 different foundation policies respectively, and outperforms the best human-selected instructions. Moreover, PGT surpasses full fine-tuning in the out-of-distribution (OOD) task-execution environments by 13.4%, indicating that our approach retains strong generalization capabilities. Since our approach stores a single latent representation for each task independently, it can be viewed as an efficient method for continual learning, without the risk of catastrophic forgetting or task interference. In short, PGT enhances the performance of agents across nearly all tasks in the Minecraft Skillforge benchmark and demonstrates robustness to the execution environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Another Vertical View: A Hierarchical Network for Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction via Spectrums](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05106v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the fast development of AI-related techniques, the applications of trajectory prediction are no longer limited to easier scenes and trajectories. More and more trajectories with different forms, such as coordinates, bounding boxes, and even high-dimensional human skeletons, need to be analyzed and forecasted. Among these heterogeneous trajectories, interactions between different elements within a frame of trajectory, which we call ``Dimension-wise Interactions'', would be more complex and challenging. However, most previous approaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, and potential dimension-wise interactions are less concerned. In this work, we expand the trajectory prediction task by introducing the trajectory dimensionality $M$, thus extending its application scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories. We first introduce the Haar transform as an alternative to Fourier transform to better capture the time-frequency properties of each trajectory-dimension. Then, we adopt the bilinear structure to model and fuse two factors simultaneously, including the time-frequency response and the dimension-wise interaction, to forecast heterogeneous trajectories via trajectory spectrums hierarchically in a generic way. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on ETH-UCY, SDD, nuScenes, and Human3.6M with heterogeneous trajectories, including 2D coordinates, 2D/3D bounding boxes, and 3D human skeletons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving Scene Synthesis on Free-form Trajectories with Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01717v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving scene synthesis along free-form trajectories is essential for driving simulations to enable closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end driving policies. While existing methods excel at novel view synthesis on recorded trajectories, they face challenges with novel trajectories due to limited views of driving videos and the vastness of driving environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel free-form driving view synthesis approach, dubbed DriveX, by leveraging video generative prior to optimize a 3D model across a variety of trajectories. Concretely, we crafted an inverse problem that enables a video diffusion model to be utilized as a prior for many-trajectory optimization of a parametric 3D model (e.g., Gaussian splatting). To seamlessly use the generative prior, we iteratively conduct this process during optimization. Our resulting model can produce high-fidelity virtual driving environments outside the recorded trajectory, enabling free-form trajectory driving simulation. Beyond real driving scenes, DriveX can also be utilized to simulate virtual driving worlds from AI-generated videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outstanding framework for simulating and generating anchor trajectory in wireless sensor networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01520v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a framework that has the ability to animate and generate different scenarios for the mobility of a movable anchor which can follow various paths in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). When the researchers use NS-2 to simulate a single anchor-assisted localization model, they face the problem of creating the movement file of the movable anchor. The proposed framework solved this problem by allowing them to create the movement scenario regarding different trajectories. The proposed framework lets the researcher set the needed parameters for simulating various static path models, which can be displayed through the graphical user interface. The researcher can also view the mobility of the movable anchor with control of its speed and communication range. The proposed framework has been validated by comparing its results to NS-2 outputs plus comparing it against existing tools. Finally, this framework has been published on the Code Project website and downloaded by many users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Flatness-based Fast Trajectory Planning for Fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01468v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the strong nonlinearity and nonholonomic dynamics, despite that various general trajectory optimization methods have been presented, few of them can guarantee efficient compu-tation and physical feasibility for relatively complicated fixed-wing UAV dynamics. Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW), which transcribes the trajectory optimization into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity in each itera-tion to achieve fast trajectory generation. Through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, the customized trajectory representation is presented, which implies the equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and deduction of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into an uncon-strained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time com-plexity to further improve efficiency. The simulation experi-ments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in ran-domly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems; Recived Reject with major revision and encouragement to resubmit (31-Oct-2024)</p></details> |
| **[TAS-TsC: A Data-Driven Framework for Estimating Time of Arrival Using Temporal-Attribute-Spatial Tri-space Coordination of Truck Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01122v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating time of arrival (ETA) for trucks is crucial for optimizing transportation efficiency in logistics. GPS trajectory data offers valuable information for ETA, but challenges arise due to temporal sparsity, variable sequence lengths, and the interdependencies among multiple trucks. To address these issues, we propose the Temporal-Attribute-Spatial Tri-space Coordination (TAS-TsC) framework, which leverages three feature spaces-temporal, attribute, and spatial-to enhance ETA. Our framework consists of a Temporal Learning Module (TLM) using state space models to capture temporal dependencies, an Attribute Extraction Module (AEM) that transforms sequential features into structured attribute embeddings, and a Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) that models the interactions among multiple trajectories using graph representation learning.These modules collaboratively learn trajectory embeddings, which are then used by a Downstream Prediction Module (DPM) to estimate arrival times. We validate TAS-TsC on real truck trajectory datasets collected from Shenzhen, China, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BIGCity: A Universal Spatiotemporal Model for Unified Trajectory and Traffic State Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00953v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical dynamic ST data includes trajectory data (representing individual-level mobility) and traffic state data (representing population-level mobility). Traditional studies often treat trajectory and traffic state data as distinct, independent modalities, each tailored to specific tasks within a single modality. However, real-world applications, such as navigation apps, require joint analysis of trajectory and traffic state data. Treating these data types as two separate domains can lead to suboptimal model performance. Although recent advances in ST data pre-training and ST foundation models aim to develop universal models for ST data analysis, most existing models are "multi-task, solo-data modality" (MTSM), meaning they can handle multiple tasks within either trajectory data or traffic state data, but not both simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper introduces BIGCity, the first multi-task, multi-data modality (MTMD) model for ST data analysis. The model targets two key challenges in designing an MTMD ST model: (1) unifying the representations of different ST data modalities, and (2) unifying heterogeneous ST analysis tasks. To overcome the first challenge, BIGCity introduces a novel ST-unit that represents both trajectories and traffic states in a unified format. Additionally, for the second challenge, BIGCity adopts a tunable large model with ST task-oriented prompt, enabling it to perform a range of heterogeneous tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BIGCity achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 tasks, outperforming 18 baselines. To the best of our knowledge, BIGCity is the first model capable of handling both trajectories and traffic states for diverse heterogeneous tasks.

Local differential privacy (LDP) provides provable privacy guarantees for users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory collection methods ensure LDP only for discrete location spaces, where the number of locations affects their privacy guarantees and trajectory utility. Moreover, the location space is often naturally continuous, such as in flying and sailing trajectories, making these methods unsuitable. This paper proposes two trajectory collection methods that ensure LDP for continuous spaces: TraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C, which perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are theoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility. TraCS can also be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the nearest discrete points. It is independent of the number of locations and has only $\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation results on discrete location spaces validate this advantage and show that TraCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility, especially for large privacy parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VLDB 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a dynamic weight adjustment scheme using a neural network to predict the optimal weights of objectives in an optimization-based motion planner. We adopt a spatial-temporal trajectory planner and incorporate diverse objectives to achieve a balance among safety, efficiency, and goal achievement in complex and dynamic environments. We design the network structure, observation encoding, and reward function to effectively train the policy network using reinforcement learning, allowing the robot to adapt its behavior in real time based on environmental and pedestrian information. Simulation results show improved safety compared to the fixed-weight planner and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods, and verify the ability of the learned policy to adaptively adjust the weights based on the observed situations. The approach's feasibility is demonstrated in a navigation task using an autonomous delivery robot across a crowded corridor over a 300 m distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

To address this issue, this paper leverages Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) for the efficient construction of Channel Knowledge Maps (CKM) and UAV trajectory design. Given the time-consuming nature of channel data collection, AI techniques are employed in a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to extract environmental features and augment the data. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving CKM construction accuracy. Moreover, integrating CKM into UAV trajectory planning reduces channel gain uncertainty, demonstrating its potential to enhance wireless communication efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We employ formal methods to describe and extract multi-agent interaction events, exposing the limitations of existing autonomous driving solutions. Additionally, we introduce a user-friendly toolkit enabling the expansion of InterHub with both public and private data. By unifying, categorizing, and analyzing diverse interaction events, InterHub facilitates cross-comparative studies and large-scale research, thereby advancing the evaluation and development of autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments.

| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 fig...</summary><p>7 figures, 3 tables, 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Barrier-Enhanced Parallel Homotopic Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10441v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Attention for Fine-grained Video Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19324v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have been greatly driven by video diffusion models, with camera motion control emerging as a crucial challenge in creating view-customized visual content. This paper introduces trajectory attention, a novel approach that performs attention along available pixel trajectories for fine-grained camera motion control. Unlike existing methods that often yield imprecise outputs or neglect temporal correlations, our approach possesses a stronger inductive bias that seamlessly injects trajectory information into the video generation process. Importantly, our approach models trajectory attention as an auxiliary branch alongside traditional temporal attention. This design enables the original temporal attention and the trajectory attention to work in synergy, ensuring both precise motion control and new content generation capability, which is critical when the trajectory is only partially available. Experiments on camera motion control for images and videos demonstrate significant improvements in precision and long-range consistency while maintaining high-quality generation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be extended to other video motion control tasks, such as first-frame-guided video editing, where it excels in maintaining content consistency over large spatial and temporal ranges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: xizaoqu.github.io/trajattn/</p></details> |
| **[Computationally efficient trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[TEA: Trajectory Encoding Augmentation for Robust and Transferable Policies in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19133v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate offline reinforcement learning (RL) with the goal of training a single robust policy that generalizes effectively across environments with unseen dynamics. We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states. These results indicate that TEA captures critical, environment-specific characteristics, enabling RL agents to generalize effectively across dynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RED: Effective Trajectory Representation Learning with Comprehensive Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15096v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can then be used for various downstream tasks, including trajectory similarity computation, trajectory classification, and travel-time estimation. However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by VLDB2025</p></details> |
| **[Synergizing Decision Making and Trajectory Planning Using Two-Stage Optimization for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18974v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a local planner that synergizes the decision making and trajectory planning modules towards autonomous driving. The decision making and trajectory planning tasks are jointly formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with an integrated objective function. However, integrating the discrete decision variables into the continuous trajectory optimization leads to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with inherent nonlinearity and nonconvexity. To address the challenge in solving the problem, the original problem is decomposed into two sub-stages, and a two-stage optimization (TSO) based approach is presented to ensure the coherence in outcomes for the two stages. The optimization problem in the first stage determines the optimal decision sequence that acts as an informed initialization. With the outputs from the first stage, the second stage necessitates the use of a high-fidelity vehicle model and strict enforcement of the collision avoidance constraints as part of the trajectory planning problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed planner across diverse multi-lane scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner simultaneously generates a sequence of optimal decisions and the corresponding trajectory that significantly improves driving performance in terms of driving safety and traveling efficiency as compared to alternative methods. Additionally, we implement the closed-loop simulation in CARLA, and the results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed planner to adapt to changing driving situations with high computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory-planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Accurate prediction of dissection trajectories is crucial for better decision-making, reducing intraoperative errors, and improving surgical training. Nevertheless, predicting these trajectories is challenging due to variable tumor margins and dynamic visual conditions. To address this issue, we create the ESD Trajectory and Confidence Map-based Safety Margin (ETSM) dataset with $1849$ short clips, focusing on submucosal dissection with a dual-arm robotic system. We also introduce a framework that combines optimal dissection trajectory prediction with a confidence map-based safety margin, providing a more secure and intelligent decision-making tool to minimize surgical risks for ESD procedures. Additionally, we propose the Regression-based Confidence Map Prediction Network (RCMNet), which utilizes a regression approach to predict confidence maps for dissection areas, thereby delineating various levels of safety margins. We evaluate our RCMNet using three distinct experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, robustness assessment, and out-of-domain evaluation. Experimental results show that our approach excels in the confidence map-based safety margin prediction task, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of only $3.18$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a regression approach for visual guidance concerning delineating varying safety levels of dissection areas. Our approach bridges gaps in current research by improving prediction accuracy and enhancing the safety of the dissection process, showing great clinical significance in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v3)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories, with their detailed geolocations, are a promising data source to compute traffic flow maps which facilitate the understanding of traffic flows at scales ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The trade-off is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial obstacles for small-scale aggregation. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We then deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases--self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data--to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant in tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, significantly reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming (QP). Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including 1) single- and dual-target following and 2) both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the target's center, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable sets of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path topology, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable set among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This has fueled interest in developing intuitive tools that let users leverage video generation as world simulators. Text-to-video (T2V) generation is one such approach, enabling video creation from text descriptions only. Yet, due to the inherent ambiguity in texts and the limited temporal information offered by text prompts, researchers have explored additional control signals like trajectory-guided systems, for more accurate T2V generation. Nonetheless, methods to evaluate whether T2V models can generate realistic interactions between multiple objects are lacking. We introduce InTraGen, a pipeline for improved trajectory-based generation of object interaction scenarios. We propose 4 new datasets and a novel trajectory quality metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed InTraGen. To achieve object interaction, we introduce a multi-modal interaction encoding pipeline with an object ID injection mechanism that enriches object-environment interactions.

A parameter adaptive control framework for AVs is proposed to enhance tracking accuracy and yaw stability. While establishing linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and three robust controllers, the control framework addresses trajectory tracking and motion control in a modular fashion, without introducing complexity into each controller. The robust performance has been guaranteed in three robust controllers by considering the parameter uncertainties, mismatch of unmodeled subsystem as well as external disturbance, comprehensively. Also, the dynamic characteristics of uncertain parameters are identified by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, while the boundaries of three robust factors are determined through combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian optimization machine learning methods, reducing the conservatism of the controller. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse robust factors are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically. The simulation results on MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim joint platform demonstrate that the proposed methodology considerably improves tracking accuracy, driving stability, and robust performance, guaranteeing the feasibility and capability of driving in extreme scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which discretizes one variable of the AGHF PDE, and converts the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which is computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim5$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.

Although deep learning-based approaches - especially those utilizing transformer-based and generative models - have markedly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions, they frequently overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions critical for real-world driving applications, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. To address the issue, this study introduces a scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction, which integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a generative framework, improving both the accuracy and plausibility of predicted trajectories. The model utilizes a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle dynamics by scaling noise with encoded historical features within the diffusion process. Particularly, it employs a cross-attention-based transformer architecture to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.11941</p></details> |

Our approach employs a constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator that considers the dynamics of the IPM to generate optimal trajectories for both the EPM and IPM. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments, motivated by capsule endoscopy operations, demonstrate the robustness of the method, showcasing resilience to external disturbances and precise control under varying conditions. The experimental results show that the IPM reaches the goal position with a maximum mean error of 0.18 cm and a standard deviation of 0.21 cm. This work introduces a unified framework for constrained trajectory optimization in magnetic manipulation, directly incorporating both the IPM's dynamics and the EPM's manipulability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v3)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Grid and Road Expressions Are Complementary for Trajectory Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14768v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can be used for many downstream tasks. Existing TRL methods use either grid trajectories, capturing movement in free space, or road trajectories, capturing movement in a road network, as input. We observe that the two types of trajectories are complementary, providing either region and location information or providing road structure and movement regularity. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal TRL method, dubbed GREEN, to jointly utilize Grid and Road trajectory Expressions for Effective representatioN learning. In particular, we transform raw GPS trajectories into both grid and road trajectories and tailor two encoders to capture their respective information. To align the two encoders such that they complement each other, we adopt a contrastive loss to encourage them to produce similar embeddings for the same raw trajectory and design a mask language model (MLM) loss to use grid trajectories to help reconstruct masked road trajectories. To learn the final trajectory representation, a dual-modal interactor is used to fuse the outputs of the two encoders via cross-attention. We compare GREEN with 7 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, finding that GREEN consistently outperforms all baselines and improves the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by an average of 15.99\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by KDD2025(August Cycle)</p></details> |
| **[Landing Trajectory Prediction for UAS Based on Generative Adversarial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14403v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models for trajectory prediction are an essential component of many advanced air mobility studies. These models help aircraft detect conflict and plan avoidance maneuvers, which is especially important in Unmanned Aircraft systems (UAS) landing management due to the congested airspace near vertiports. In this paper, we propose a landing trajectory prediction model for UAS based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is a prestigious neural network that has been developed for many years. In previous research, GAN has achieved many state-of-the-art results in many generation tasks. The GAN consists of one neural network generator and a neural network discriminator. Because of the learning capacity of the neural networks, the generator is capable to understand the features of the sample trajectory. The generator takes the previous trajectory as input and outputs some random status of a flight. According to the results of the experiences, the proposed model can output more accurate predictions than the baseline method(GMR) in various datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, we also create a real UAV landing dataset that includes more than 2600 trajectories of drone control manually by real pilots.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, AIAA SCITECH 2023</p></details> |
| **[Tra-MoE: Learning Trajectory Prediction Model from Multiple Domains for Adaptive Policy Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14519v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multiple domains is a primary factor that influences the generalization of a single unified robot system. In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Trajectory and Power Control in Ultra-Dense UAV Networks: A Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14052v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ultra-dense unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, it is challenging to coordinate the resource allocation and interference management among large-scale UAVs, for providing flexible and efficient service coverage to the ground users (GUs). In this paper, we propose a learning-based resource allocation scheme in an ultra-dense UAV communication network, where the GUs' service demands are time-varying with unknown distributions. We formulate the non-cooperative game among multiple co-channel UAVs as a stochastic game, where each UAV jointly optimizes its trajectory, user association, and downlink power control to maximize the expectation of its locally cumulative energy efficiency under the interference and energy constraints. To cope with the scalability issue in a large-scale network, we further formulate the problem as a mean-field game (MFG), which simplifies the interactions among the UAVs into a two-player game between a representative UAV and a mean-field. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the MFG, and propose a model-free mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm named maximum entropy mean-field deep Q network (ME-MFDQN) to solve the mean-field equilibrium in both fully and partially observable scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the performance can be further enhanced if the GUs' service demands exhibit higher temporal correlation or if the UAVs have wider observation capabilities over their nearby GUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

By converting the vehicle's position and velocity information from the Cartesian coordinate system to Frenet coordinate system, this method can more accurately describe the vehicle's deviation and travel distance relative to the center line of the road. The DDPG algorithm adopts the Actor-Critic framework, uses deep neural networks for strategy and value evaluation, and combines the experience replay mechanism and target network to improve the algorithm's stability and data utilization efficiency. Experimental results show that the DDPG algorithm based on Frenet coordinate system performs well in trajectory-tracking tasks in complex environments, achieves high-precision and stable path tracking, and demonstrates its application potential in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Diffusion Policy: manipulation trajectory generation via contact guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12982v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making in robotics using denoising diffusion processes has increasingly become a hot research topic, but end-to-end policies perform poorly in tasks with rich contact and have limited controllability. This paper proposes Hierarchical Diffusion Policy (HDP), a new imitation learning method of using objective contacts to guide the generation of robot trajectories. The policy is divided into two layers: the high-level policy predicts the contact for the robot's next object manipulation based on 3D information, while the low-level policy predicts the action sequence toward the high-level contact based on the latent variables of observation and contact. We represent both level policies as conditional denoising diffusion processes, and combine behavioral cloning and Q-learning to optimize the low level policy for accurately guiding actions towards contact. We benchmark Hierarchical Diffusion Policy across 6 different tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the existing state of-the-art imitation learning method Diffusion Policy with an average improvement of 20.8%. We find that contact guidance yields significant improvements, including superior performance, greater interpretability, and stronger controllability, especially on contact-rich tasks. To further unlock the potential of HDP, this paper proposes a set of key technical contributions including snapshot gradient optimization, 3D conditioning, and prompt guidance, which improve the policy's optimization efficiency, spatial awareness, and controllability respectively. Finally, real world experiments verify that HDP can handle both rigid and deformable objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.04137 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[C$^{2}$INet: Realizing Incremental Trajectory Prediction with Prior-Aware Continual Causal Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12313v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agents in complex scenarios is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods often overlook environmental biases, which leads to poor generalization. Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Information Minimization in UAV-Assisted Covert Communication: Trajectory and Beamforming Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12312v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential for time-sensitive applications. Due to wireless channel variation, received data may have an expiration time, particularly in critical situations such as rescue operations, natural disasters, or the military. Age of Information (AoI) is a metric that measures the freshness of received packets to specify the validity period of information. In addition, it is necessary to guarantee the privacy of confidential information transmission through air-to-ground links against eavesdroppers. This paper investigates UAV-assisted covert communication to minimize AoI in the presence of an aerial eavesdropper for the first time. However, to ensure the eavesdropper's error detection rate, UAV-enabled beamforming employs the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique to cover the covert user by a public user. PD-NOMA technique significantly improves the user's AoI, too. The joint optimization problem contains non-convex constraints and coupled optimization variables, including UAV trajectory, beamforming design, and the user's AoI which is challenging to derive a direct solution. We have developed an efficient alternating optimization technique to address the formulated optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of the main parameters on the performance of the proposed communication system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11587v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we study contraction of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and contraction rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Map-Free Trajectory Prediction with Map Distillation and Hierarchical Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10961v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable motion forecasting of surrounding agents is essential for ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. Many existing trajectory prediction methods rely heavily on high-definition (HD) maps as strong driving priors. However, the availability and accuracy of these priors are not guaranteed due to substantial costs to build, localization errors of vehicles, or ongoing road constructions. In this paper, we introduce MFTP, a Map-Free Trajectory Prediction method that offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for HD maps during inference while still benefiting from map priors during training via knowledge distillation. Second, we present a novel hierarchical encoder that effectively extracts spatial-temporal agent features and aggregates them into multiple trajectory queries. Additionally, we introduce an iterative decoder that sequentially decodes trajectory queries to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse dataset under the map-free setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

Within this problem setting, a pivotal challenge revolves around \textit{catastrophic forgetting} issue, wherein the agent is prone to effortlessly erode the decisional knowledge associated with past encountered tasks when learning the new one. In recent progresses, the \textit{generative replay} methods have showcased substantial potential by employing generative models to replay data distribution of past tasks. Compared to storing the data from past tasks directly, this category of methods circumvents the growing storage overhead and possible data privacy concerns. However, constrained by the expressive capacity of generative models, existing \textit{generative replay} methods face challenges in faithfully reconstructing the data distribution of past tasks, particularly in scenarios with a myriad of tasks or high-dimensional data. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in various generative tasks, this paper introduces a novel continual RL algorithm DISTR (Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay) that employs a diffusion model to memorize the high-return trajectory distribution of each encountered task and wakeups these distributions during the policy learning on new tasks. Besides, considering the impracticality of replaying all past data each time, a prioritization mechanism is proposed to prioritize the trajectory replay of pivotal tasks in our method. Empirical experiments on the popular continual RL benchmark \texttt{Continual World} demonstrate that our proposed method obtains a favorable balance between \textit{stability} and \textit{plasticity}, surpassing various existing continual RL baselines in average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, inclusion at ICLR 2024 Workshop on Generative Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tenure and Research Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10575v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</p></details> |  |

These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest characterised circulatory (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) system conditions. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours ahead with 30 minutes of context, using solely GNSS positions, without relying on any additional information such as speed, course, or external conditions - unlike many traditional methods. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 28 pages, 18 figures |

This paper focuses on the integrated design of UAV trajectories and the precoders at both the transmitter and UAV in a UAV-assisted relay communication system, accounting for transmit power constraints and UAV flight limitations. Unlike previous works that primarily address multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with Gaussian inputs, we investigate a more realistic scenario involving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet inputs. To tackle the challenging and inherently non-convex problem, we propose an efficient solution algorithm that leverages successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its capability to optimize system performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse.

| **[Efficient Trajectory Generation in 3D Environments with Multi-Level Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08323v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a robust and efficient framework to generate global trajectories for ground robots in complex 3D environments. The proposed method takes point cloud as input and efficiently constructs a multi-level map using triangular patches as the basic elements. A kinematic path search is adopted on the patches, where motion primitives on different patches combine to form the global min-time cost initial trajectory. We use a same-level expansion method to locate the nearest obstacle for each trajectory waypoint and construct an objective function with curvature, smoothness and obstacle terms for optimization. We evaluate the method on several complex 3D point cloud maps. Compared to existing methods, our method demonstrates higher robustness to point cloud noise, enabling the generation of high quality trajectory while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ck-tian/MLMC-planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training Spatiotemporal Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods. We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets. Implementation of the pipeline is publicly available at https://github.com/Logan-Lin/UniTE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Transfer Learning using Attention Latent Features for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06087v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancements of sensor hardware, traffic infrastructure and deep learning architectures, trajectory prediction of vehicles has established a solid foundation in intelligent transportation systems. However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific traffic networks at particular time periods. Consequently, deep learning models trained on one network may struggle to generalize effectively to unseen networks. To address this, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal trajectory prediction framework that performs cross-domain adaption on the attention representation of a Transformer-based model. A graph convolutional network is also integrated to construct dynamic graph feature embeddings that accurately model the complex spatial-temporal interactions between the multi-agent vehicles across multiple traffic domains. The proposed framework is validated on two case studies involving the cross-city and cross-period settings. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves superior trajectory prediction and domain adaptation performances over the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 2024</p></details> |
| **[Tracing the Roots: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Trajectories for Origin Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07449v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, garnering significant research interest in recent years. Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **['Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories': A Reproducibility Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07200v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the reproducibility of the paper 'Explaining RL decisions with trajectories'. The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, which state that (i) training on less trajectories induces a lower initial state value, (ii) trajectories in a cluster present similar high-level patterns, (iii) distant trajectories influence the decision of an agent, and (iv) humans correctly identify the attributed trajectories to the decision of the agent. We recover the environments used by the authors based on the partial original code they provided for one of the environments (Grid-World), and implemented the remaining from scratch (Seaquest, HalfCheetah, Breakout and Q*Bert). While we confirm that (i), (ii), and (iii) partially hold, we extend on the largely qualitative experiments from the authors by introducing a quantitative metric to further support (iii), and new experiments and visual results for (i). Moreover, we investigate the use of different clustering algorithms and encoder architectures to further support (ii). We could not support (iv), given the limited extent of the original experiments. We conclude that, while some of the claims can be supported, further investigations and experiments could be of interest. We recognise the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness. The package is available at: https://github.com/chatterjee-d/QuITOv2.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted; 42 pages, comments are welcome</p></details> |

This interest necessitates accurate initial orbit determination (IOD) and orbit prediction (OP) in this domain, which faces significant challenges such as severe nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, large state-space volume, and sparse, faint, and unreliable measurements. This paper explores the capability of data-driven Koopman operator-based approximations for OP in these scenarios. Three stable periodic trajectories from distinct cislunar families are analyzed. The analysis includes theoretical justification for using a linear time-invariant system as the data-driven surrogate. This theoretical framework is supported by experimental validation. Furthermore, the accuracy is assessed by comparing the spectral content captured to period estimates derived from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Poincare-like sections.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.13784</p></details> |

Our approach integrates a robustness metric for Linear Temporal Logics (LTL) with the system's motion constraints, ensuring that the resulting trajectories are both optimal and executable. We introduce a cost function that recursively computes the robustness of temporal logic specifications while penalizing time and control effort, striking a balance between path feasibility and logical correctness. We validate our approach with simulations and real-world experiments in complex environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust and practical motion plans. This work represents a significant step towards expanding the applicability of motion planning algorithms to more complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Omnidirectional Jumping Trajectory Planning for Quadrupedal Robots on Uneven Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04494v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural terrain complexity often necessitates agile movements like jumping in animals to improve traversal efficiency. To enable similar capabilities in quadruped robots, complex real-time jumping maneuvers are required. Current research does not adequately address the problem of online omnidirectional jumping and neglects the robot's kinodynamic constraints during trajectory generation. This paper proposes a general and complete cascade online optimization framework for omnidirectional jumping for quadruped robots. Our solution systematically encompasses jumping trajectory generation, a trajectory tracking controller, and a landing controller. It also incorporates environmental perception to navigate obstacles that standard locomotion cannot bypass, such as jumping from high platforms. We introduce a novel jumping plane to parameterize omnidirectional jumping motion and formulate a tightly coupled optimization problem accounting for the kinodynamic constraints, simultaneously optimizing CoM trajectory, Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs), and joint states. To meet the online requirements, we propose an accelerated evolutionary algorithm as the trajectory optimizer to address the complexity of kinodynamic constraints. To ensure stability and accuracy in environmental perception post-landing, we introduce a coarse-to-fine relocalization method that combines global Branch and Bound (BnB) search with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for precise positioning during navigation and jumping. The proposed framework achieves jump trajectory generation in approximately 0.1 seconds with a warm start and has been successfully validated on two quadruped robots on uneven terrains. Additionally, we extend the framework's versatility to humanoid robots.</p></details> | Submitted to IJRR |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

This impact remains elusive due to the complex interdependence of these factors or locationrelated user behavior variations. It is also not clear which factor is additional information which are not already contained in the historical demand. Intermodal dependencies between bike-sharing and other modes are also underexplored, and the value of this information has not been studied in degraded situations. The proposed study analyzes the impact of adding contextual data, such as weather, time embedding, and road traffic flow, to predict bike-sharing Origin-Destination (OD) flows in atypical weather situations Our study highlights a mild relationship between prediction quality of bike-sharing demand and road traffic flow, while the introduced time embedding allows outperforming state-of-the-art results, particularly in the case of degraded weather conditions. Including weather data as an additional input further improves our model with respect to the basic ST-ED-RMGC prediction model by reducing of more than 20% the prediction error in degraded weather condition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Node Classification With Integrated Reject Option](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03190v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key tasks in graph learning is node classification. While Graph neural networks have been used for various applications, their adaptivity to reject option setting is not previously explored. In this paper, we propose NCwR, a novel approach to node classification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with an integrated reject option, which allows the model to abstain from making predictions when uncertainty is high. We propose both cost-based and coverage-based methods for classification with abstention in node classification setting using GNNs. We perform experiments using our method on three standard citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed and compare with relevant baselines. We also model the Legal judgment prediction problem on ILDC dataset as a node classification problem where nodes represent legal cases and edges represent citations. We further interpret the model by analyzing the cases that the model abstains from predicting by visualizing which part of the input features influenced this decision.</p></details> |  |
