| **[Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Interpolants and FÃ¶llmer   Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13724v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for probabilistic forecasting of dynamical systems based on generative modeling. Given observations of the system state over time, we formulate the forecasting problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of the future system state given its current state. To this end, we leverage the framework of stochastic interpolants, which facilitates the construction of a generative model between an arbitrary base distribution and the target. We design a fictitious, non-physical stochastic dynamics that takes as initial condition the current system state and produces as output a sample from the target conditional distribution in finite time and without bias. This process therefore maps a point mass centered at the current state onto a probabilistic ensemble of forecasts. We prove that the drift coefficient entering the stochastic differential equation (SDE) achieving this task is non-singular, and that it can be learned efficiently by square loss regression over the time-series data. We show that the drift and the diffusion coefficients of this SDE can be adjusted after training, and that a specific choice that minimizes the impact of the estimation error gives a F\"ollmer process. We highlight the utility of our approach on several complex, high-dimensional forecasting problems, including stochastically forced Navier-Stokes and video prediction on the KTH and CLEVRER datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive estimation for Weakly Dependent Functional Times Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13706v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The local regularity of functional time series is studied under $L^p-m-$appro\-ximability assumptions. The sample paths are observed with error at possibly random design points. Non-asymptotic concentration bounds of the regularity estimators are derived. As an application, we build nonparametric mean and autocovariance functions estimators that adapt to the regularity and the design, which can be sparse or dense. We also derive the asymptotic normality of the mean estimator, which allows honest inference for irregular mean functions. Simulations and a real data application illustrate the performance of the new estimators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Time-Series Classification: An Extensive Empirical   Study and Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10060v3)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Augmentation (DA) has emerged as an indispensable strategy in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily due to its capacity to amplify training samples, thereby bolstering model robustness, diversifying datasets, and curtailing overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible, user-oriented tools. In light of these challenges, this study embarks on an exhaustive dissection of DA methodologies within the TSC realm. Our initial approach involved an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing that contemporary surveys scarcely capture the breadth of advancements in DA for TSC, prompting us to meticulously analyze over 100 scholarly articles to distill more than 60 unique DA techniques. This rigorous analysis precipitated the formulation of a novel taxonomy, purpose-built for the intricacies of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five principal echelons: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. Our taxonomy promises to serve as a robust navigational aid for scholars, offering clarity and direction in method selection. Addressing the conspicuous absence of holistic evaluations for prevalent DA techniques, we executed an all-encompassing empirical assessment, wherein upwards of 15 DA strategies were subjected to scrutiny across 8 UCR time-series datasets, employing ResNet and a multi-faceted evaluation paradigm encompassing Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, yielding a benchmark accuracy of 88.94 +- 11.83%. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, with...</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine learning approach to detect dynamical states from recurrence   measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10298v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We integrate machine learning approaches with nonlinear time series analysis, specifically utilizing recurrence measures to classify various dynamical states emerging from time series. We implement three machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine for this study. The input features are derived from the recurrence quantification of nonlinear time series and characteristic measures of the corresponding recurrence networks. For training and testing we generate synthetic data from standard nonlinear dynamical systems and evaluate the efficiency and performance of the machine learning algorithms in classifying time series into periodic, chaotic, hyper-chaotic, or noisy categories. Additionally, we explore the significance of input features in the classification scheme and find that the features quantifying the density of recurrence points are the most relevant. Furthermore, we illustrate how the trained algorithms can successfully predict the dynamical states of two variable stars, SX Her and AC Her from the data of their light curves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multifractal wavelet dynamic mode decomposition modeling for marketing   time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13361v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marketing is the way we ensure our sales are the best in the market, our prices the most accessible, and our clients satisfied, thus ensuring our brand has the widest distribution. This requires sophisticated and advanced understanding of the whole related network. Indeed, marketing data may exist in different forms such as qualitative and quantitative data. However, in the literature, it is easily noted that large bibliographies may be collected about qualitative studies, while only a few studies adopt a quantitative point of view. This is a major drawback that results in marketing science still focusing on design, although the market is strongly dependent on quantities such as money and time. Indeed, marketing data may form time series such as brand sales in specified periods, brand-related prices over specified periods, market shares, etc. The purpose of the present work is to investigate some marketing models based on time series for various brands. This paper aims to combine the dynamic mode decomposition and wavelet decomposition to study marketing series due to both prices, and volume sales in order to explore the effect of the time scale on the persistence of brand sales in the market and on the forecasting of such persistence, according to the characteristics of the brand and the related market competition or competitors. Our study is based on a sample of Saudi brands during the period 22 November 2017 to 30 December 2021.</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting density-valued functional panel data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13340v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a statistical method for modeling and forecasting functional panel data, where each element is a density. Density functions are nonnegative and have a constrained integral and thus do not constitute a linear vector space. We implement a center log-ratio transformation to transform densities into unconstrained functions. These functions exhibit cross-sectionally correlation and temporal dependence. Via a functional analysis of variance decomposition, we decompose the unconstrained functional panel data into a deterministic trend component and a time-varying residual component. To produce forecasts for the time-varying component, a functional time series forecasting method, based on the estimation of the long-range covariance, is implemented. By combining the forecasts of the time-varying residual component with the deterministic trend component, we obtain h-step-ahead forecast curves for multiple populations. Illustrated by age- and sex-specific life-table death counts in the United States, we apply our proposed method to generate forecasts of the life-table death counts for 51 states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine-Made Media: Monitoring the Mobilization of Machine-Generated   Articles on Misinformation and Mainstream News Websites](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09820v5)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have gained traction, an increasing number of news websites have begun utilizing them to generate articles. However, not only can these language models produce factually inaccurate articles on reputable websites but disreputable news sites can utilize LLMs to mass produce misinformation. To begin to understand this phenomenon, we present one of the first large-scale studies of the prevalence of synthetic articles within online news media. To do this, we train a DeBERTa-based synthetic news detector and classify over 15.46 million articles from 3,074 misinformation and mainstream news websites. We find that between January 1, 2022, and May 1, 2023, the relative number of synthetic news articles increased by 57.3% on mainstream websites while increasing by 474% on misinformation sites. We find that this increase is largely driven by smaller less popular websites. Analyzing the impact of the release of ChatGPT using an interrupted-time-series, we show that while its release resulted in a marked increase in synthetic articles on small sites as well as misinformation news websites, there was not a corresponding increase on large mainstream news websites.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICWSM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Machine-learning optimized measurements of chaotic dynamical systems via   the information bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04896v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deterministic chaos permits a precise notion of a "perfect measurement" as one that, when obtained repeatedly, captures all of the information created by the system's evolution with minimal redundancy. Finding an optimal measurement is challenging, and has generally required intimate knowledge of the dynamics in the few cases where it has been done. We establish an equivalence between a perfect measurement and a variant of the information bottleneck. As a consequence, we can employ machine learning to optimize measurement processes that efficiently extract information from trajectory data. We obtain approximately optimal measurements for multiple chaotic maps and lay the necessary groundwork for efficient information extraction from general time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://distributed-information-bottleneck.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Castor: Competing shapelets for fast and accurate time series   classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13176v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapelets are discriminative subsequences, originally embedded in shapelet-based decision trees but have since been extended to shapelet-based transformations. We propose Castor, a simple, efficient, and accurate time series classification algorithm that utilizes shapelets to transform time series. The transformation organizes shapelets into groups with varying dilation and allows the shapelets to compete over the time context to construct a diverse feature representation. By organizing the shapelets into groups, we enable the transformation to transition between levels of competition, resulting in methods that more closely resemble distance-based transformations or dictionary-based transformations. We demonstrate, through an extensive empirical investigation, that Castor yields transformations that result in classifiers that are significantly more accurate than several state-of-the-art classifiers. In an extensive ablation study, we examine the effect of choosing hyperparameters and suggest accurate and efficient default values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal</p></details> |
| **[Generalizability Under Sensor Failure: Tokenization + Transformers   Enable More Robust Latent Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18546v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major goal in neuroscience is to discover neural data representations that generalize. This goal is challenged by variability along recording sessions (e.g. environment), subjects (e.g. varying neural structures), and sensors (e.g. sensor noise), among others. Recent work has begun to address generalization across sessions and subjects, but few study robustness to sensor failure which is highly prevalent in neuroscience experiments. In order to address these generalizability dimensions we first collect our own electroencephalography dataset with numerous sessions, subjects, and sensors, then study two time series models: EEGNet (Lawhern et al., 2018) and TOTEM (Talukder et al., 2024). EEGNet is a widely used convolutional neural network, while TOTEM is a discrete time series tokenizer and transformer model. We find that TOTEM outperforms or matches EEGNet across all generalizability cases. Finally through analysis of TOTEM's latent codebook we observe that tokenization enables generalization.</p></details> |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. We introduce a new measure for gauging imputation performances, and simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. An NYC taxi traffic data set is also analyzed by imposing general missing patterns and gauging the imputation performances.</p></details> |
| **[kDGLM: a R package for Bayesian analysis of Generalized Dynamic Linear   Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13069v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces kDGLM, an R package designed for Bayesian analysis of Generalized Dynamic Linear Models (GDLM), with a primary focus on both uni- and multivariate exponential families. Emphasizing sequential inference for time series data, the kDGLM package provides comprehensive support for fitting, smoothing, monitoring, and feed-forward interventions. The methodology employed by kDGLM, as proposed in Alves et al. (2024), seamlessly integrates with well-established techniques from the literature, particularly those used in (Gaussian) Dynamic Models. These include discount strategies, autoregressive components, transfer functions, and more. Leveraging key properties of the Kalman filter and smoothing, kDGLM exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, enabling virtually instantaneous fitting times that scale linearly with the length of the time series. This characteristic makes it an exceptionally powerful tool for the analysis of extended time series. For example, when modeling monthly hospital admissions in Brazil due to gastroenteritis from 2010 to 2022, the fitting process took a mere 0.11s. Even in a spatial-time variant of the model (27 outcomes, 110 latent states, and 156 months, yielding 17,160 parameters), the fitting time was only 4.24s. Currently, the kDGLM package supports a range of distributions, including univariate Normal (unknown mean and observational variance), bivariate Normal (unknown means, observational variances, and correlation), Poisson, Gamma (known shape and unknown mean), and Multinomial (known number of trials and unknown event probabilities). Additionally, kDGLM allows the joint modeling of multiple time series, provided each series follows one of the supported distributions. Ongoing efforts aim to continuously expand the supported distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparison of Deep Learning Architectures for Spacecraft Anomaly   Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12864v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spacecraft operations are highly critical, demanding impeccable reliability and safety. Ensuring the optimal performance of a spacecraft requires the early detection and mitigation of anomalies, which could otherwise result in unit or mission failures. With the advent of deep learning, a surge of interest has been seen in leveraging these sophisticated algorithms for anomaly detection in space operations. This study aims to compare the efficacy of various deep learning architectures in detecting anomalies in spacecraft data. The deep learning models under investigation include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based architectures. Each of these models was trained and validated using a comprehensive dataset sourced from multiple spacecraft missions, encompassing diverse operational scenarios and anomaly types. Initial results indicate that while CNNs excel in identifying spatial patterns and may be effective for some classes of spacecraft data, LSTMs and RNNs show a marked proficiency in capturing temporal anomalies seen in time-series spacecraft telemetry. The Transformer-based architectures, given their ability to focus on both local and global contexts, have showcased promising results, especially in scenarios where anomalies are subtle and span over longer durations. Additionally, considerations such as computational efficiency, ease of deployment, and real-time processing capabilities were evaluated. While CNNs and LSTMs demonstrated a balance between accuracy and computational demands, Transformer architectures, though highly accurate, require significant computational resources. In conclusion, the choice of deep learning architecture for spacecraft anomaly detection is highly contingent on the nature of the data, the type of anomalies, and operational constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE Aeroconf 2024</p></details> |
| **[Behave-XAI: Deep Explainable Learning of Behavioral Representational   Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00016v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>According to the latest trend of artificial intelligence, AI-systems needs to clarify regarding general,specific decisions,services provided by it. Only consumer is satisfied, with explanation , for example, why any classification result is the outcome of any given time. This actually motivates us using explainable or human understandable AI for a behavioral mining scenario, where users engagement on digital platform is determined from context, such as emotion, activity, weather, etc. However, the output of AI-system is not always systematically correct, and often systematically correct, but apparently not-perfect and thereby creating confusions, such as, why the decision is given? What is the reason underneath? In this context, we first formulate the behavioral mining problem in deep convolutional neural network architecture. Eventually, we apply a recursive neural network due to the presence of time-series data from users physiological and environmental sensor-readings. Once the model is developed, explanations are presented with the advent of XAI models in front of users. This critical step involves extensive trial with users preference on explanations over conventional AI, judgement of credibility of explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn by arXiv administrators as the   second author was added without their knowledge or consent</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Dynamic Memory Requirements for Scientific Workflow Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08185v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing amount of data available to scientists in disciplines as diverse as bioinformatics, physics, and remote sensing, scientific workflow systems are becoming increasingly important for composing and executing scalable data analysis pipelines. When writing such workflows, users need to specify the resources to be reserved for tasks so that sufficient resources are allocated on the target cluster infrastructure. Crucially, underestimating a task's memory requirements can result in task failures. Therefore, users often resort to overprovisioning, resulting in significant resource wastage and decreased throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel online method that uses monitoring time series data to predict task memory usage in order to reduce the memory wastage of scientific workflow tasks. Our method predicts a task's runtime, divides it into k equally-sized segments, and learns the peak memory value for each segment depending on the total file input size. We evaluate the prototype implementation of our method using workflows from the publicly available nf-core repository, showing an average memory wastage reduction of 29.48% compared to the best state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in 2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</p></details> |
