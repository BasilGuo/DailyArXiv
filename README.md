Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of defensive mechanisms such as Root Origin Validation (ROV), Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA), and PeerROV across distinct AS deployment types. Our findings reveal critical insights into the strengths and limitations of current BGP security measures, providing guidance for future policy development and implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to and accepted by IEEE ISNCC'24</p></details> |
| **[Global BGP Attacks that Evade Route Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09622v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the deployment of comprehensive Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) security measures is still in progress, BGP monitoring continues to play a critical role in protecting the Internet from routing attacks. Fundamentally, monitoring involves observing BGP feeds to detect suspicious announcements and taking defensive action. However, BGP monitoring relies on seeing the malicious BGP announcement in the first place! In this paper, we develop a novel attack that can hide itself from all state-of-the-art BGP monitoring systems we tested while affecting the entire Internet. The attack involves launching a sub-prefix hijack with the RFC-specified NO_EXPORT community attached to prevent networks with the malicious route installed from sending the route to BGP monitoring systems. We study the viability of this attack at four tier-1 networks and find all networks we studied were vulnerable to the attack. Finally, we propose a mitigation that significantly improves the robustness of the BGP monitoring ecosystem. Our paper aims to raise awareness of this issue and offer guidance to providers to protect against such attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[MAD-MulW: A Multi-Window Anomaly Detection Framework for BGP Security Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11225v1)** | 2023-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, various international security events have occurred frequently and interacted between real society and cyberspace. Traditional traffic monitoring mainly focuses on the local anomalous status of events due to a large amount of data. BGP-based event monitoring makes it possible to perform differential analysis of international events. For many existing traffic anomaly detection methods, we have observed that the window-based noise reduction strategy effectively improves the success rate of time series anomaly detection. Motivated by this observation, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model, MAD-MulW, which incorporates a multi-window serial framework. Firstly, we design the W-GAT module to adaptively update the sample weights within the window and retain the updated information of the trailing sample, which not only reduces the outlier samples' noise but also avoids the space consumption of data scale expansion. Then, the W-LAT module based on predictive reconstruction both captures the trend of sample fluctuations over a certain period of time and increases the interclass variation through the reconstruction of the predictive sample. Our model has been experimentally validated on multiple BGP anomalous events with an average F1 score of over 90\%, which demonstrates the significant improvement effect of the stage windows and adaptive strategy on the efficiency and stability of the timing model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[BGP Typo: A Longitudinal Study and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00335v1)** | 2023-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP is the protocol that keeps Internet connected. Operators use it by announcing Address Prefixes (APs), namely IP address blocks, that they own or that they agree to serve as transit for. BGP enables ISPs to devise complex policies to control what AP announcements to accept (import policy), the route selection, and what AP to announce and to whom (export policy). In addition, BGP is also used to coarse traffic engineering for incoming traffic via the prepend mechanism. However, there are no wide-spread good tools for managing BGP and much of the complex configuration is done by home-brewed scripts or simply by manually configuring router with bare-bone terminal interface. This process generates many configuration mistakes. In this study, we examine typos that propagates in BGP announcements and can be found in many of the public databases. We classify them and quantify their presence, and surprisingly found tens of ASNs and hundreds of APs affected by typos on any given time. In addition, we suggest a simple algorithm that can detect (and clean) most of them with almost no false positives.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIGHTYEAR: Using Modularity to Scale BGP Control Plane Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09635v2)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current network control plane verification tools cannot scale to large networks, because of the complexity of jointly reasoning about the behaviors of all nodes in the network. In this paper we present a modular approach to control plane verification, whereby end-to-end network properties are verified via a set of purely local checks on individual nodes and edges. The approach targets the verification of safety properties for BGP configurations and provides guarantees in the face of both arbitrary external route announcements from neighbors and arbitrary node/link failures. We have proven the approach correct and also implemented it in a tool called Lightyear. Experimental results show that Lightyear scales dramatically better than prior control plane verifiers. Further, we have used Lightyear to verify three properties of the wide area network of a major cloud provider, containing hundreds of routers and tens of thousands of edges. To our knowledge no prior tool has been demonstrated to provide such guarantees at that scale. Finally, in addition to the scaling benefits, our modular approach to verification makes it easy to localize the causes of configuration errors and to support incremental re-verification as configurations are updated.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (+ 2 pages references), 3 figures, Accepted at SIGCOMM '23</p></details> |
| **[Live Long and Prosper:Analyzing Long-Lived MOAS Prefixes in BGP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08490v1)** | 2023-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP exchanges reachability information in the form of prefixes, which are usually originated by a single Autonomous System (AS). If multiple ASes originate the same prefix, this is referred to as a Multiple Origin ASes (MOAS) prefix. One reason for MOAS prefixes are BGP prefix hijacks, which are mostly short-lived and have been studied extensively in the past years. In contrast to short-lived MOAS, long-lived MOAS have remained largely understudied. In this paper, we focus on long-lived MOAS prefixes and perform an in-depth study over six years. We identify around 24k long-lived MOAS prefixes in IPv4 and 1.4k in IPv6 being announced in January 2023. By analyzing the RPKI status we find that more than 40% of MOAS prefixes have all origins registered correctly, with only a minority of MOAS having invalid origins. Moreover, we find that the most prominent CIDR size of MOAS prefixes is /24 for IPv4 and /48 for IPv6, suggesting their use for fine-grained traffic steering. We attribute a considerable number of MOAS prefixes to mergers and acquisitions of companies. Additionally, more than 90% of MOAS prefixes are originated by two origin ASes, with the majority of detected origin AS relations being customer-provider. Finally, we identify that the majority of MOAS users are IT companies, and just 0.9% of IPv4 MOAS and 6.3% of IPv6 MOAS prefixes are used for anycast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oscilloscope: Detecting BGP Hijacks in the Data Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12843v1)** | 2023-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lack of security of the Internet routing protocol (BGP) has allowed attackers to divert Internet traffic and consequently perpetrate service disruptions, monetary frauds, and even citizen surveillance for decades. State-of-the-art defenses rely on geo-distributed BGP monitors to detect rogue BGP announcements. As we show, though, attackers can easily evade detection by engineering their announcements. This paper presents Oscilloscope, an approach to accurately detect BGP hijacks by relying on real-time traffic analysis. As hijacks inevitably change the characteristics of the diverted traffic, the key idea is to track these changes in real time and flag them. The main challenge is that "normal" Internet events (e.g., network reconfigurations, link failures, load balancing) also change the underlying traffic characteristics - and they are way more frequent than hijacks. Naive traffic analyses would hence lead to too many false positives. We observe that hijacks typically target a subset of the prefixes announced by Internet service providers and only divert a subset of their traffic. In contrast, normal events lead to more uniform changes across prefixes and traffic. Oscilloscope uses this observation to filter out non-hijack events by checking whether they affect multiple related prefixes or not. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Oscilloscope quickly and accurately detects hijacks in realistic traffic traces containing hundreds of events.</p></details> |  |
| **[BGP-Multipath Routing in the Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10938v2)** | 2022-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP-Multipath (BGP-M) is a multipath routing technique for load balancing. Distinct from other techniques deployed at a router inside an Autonomous System (AS), BGP-M is deployed at a border router that has installed multiple inter-domain border links to a neighbour AS. It uses the equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) function of a border router to share traffic to a destination prefix on different border links. Despite recent research interests in multipath routing, there is little study on BGP-M. Here we provide the first measurement and a comprehensive analysis of BGP-M routing in the Internet. We extracted information on BGP-M from query data collected from Looking Glass (LG) servers. We revealed that BGP-M has already been extensively deployed and used in the Internet. A particular example is Hurricane Electric (AS6939), a Tier-1 network operator, which has implemented >1,000 cases of BGP-M at 69 of its border routers to prefixes in 611 of its neighbour ASes, including many hyper-giant ASes and large content providers, on both IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. We examined the distribution and operation of BGP-M. We also ran traceroute using RIPE Atlas to infer the routing paths, the schemes of traffic allocation, and the delay on border links. This study provided the state-of-the-art knowledge on BGP-M with novel insights into the unique features and the distinct advantages of BGP-M as an effective and readily available technique for load balancing.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-View Framework for BGP Anomaly Detection via Graph Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12793v1)** | 2021-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the default protocol for exchanging routing reachability information on the Internet, the abnormal behavior in traffic of Border Gateway Protocols (BGP) is closely related to Internet anomaly events. The BGP anomalous detection model ensures stable routing services on the Internet through its real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities. Previous studies either focused on the feature selection problem or the memory characteristic in data, while ignoring the relationship between features and the precise time correlation in feature (whether it's long or short term dependence). In this paper, we propose a multi-view model for capturing anomalous behaviors from BGP update traffic, in which Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method is used to reduce the noise in the original time-series data, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to discover feature relationships and time correlations in feature, respectively. Our results outperform the state-of-the-art methods at the anomaly detection task, with the average F1 score up to 96.3% and 93.2% on the balanced and imbalanced datasets respectively. Meanwhile, our model can be extended to classify multiple anomalous and to detect unknown events.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AS-Level BGP Community Usage Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03816v1)** | 2021-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP communities are a popular mechanism used by network operators for traffic engineering, blackholing, and to realize network policies and business strategies. In recent years, many research works have contributed to our understanding of how BGP communities are utilized, as well as how they can reveal secondary insights into real-world events such as outages and security attacks. However, one fundamental question remains unanswered: "Which ASes tag announcements with BGP communities and which remove communities in the announcements they receive?" A grounded understanding of where BGP communities are added or removed can help better model and predict BGP-based actions in the Internet and characterize the strategies of network operators. In this paper we develop, validate, and share data from the first algorithm that can infer BGP community tagging and cleaning behavior at the AS-level. The algorithm is entirely passive and uses BGP update messages and snapshots, e.g. from public route collectors, as input. First, we quantify the correctness and accuracy of the algorithm in controlled experiments with simulated topologies. To validate in the wild, we announce prefixes with communities and confirm that more than 90% of the ASes that we classify behave as our algorithm predicts. Finally, we apply the algorithm to data from four sets of BGP collectors: RIPE, RouteViews, Isolario, and PCH. Tuned conservatively, our algorithm ascribes community tagging and cleaning behaviors to more than 13k ASes, the majority of which are large networks and providers. We make our algorithm and inferences available as a public resource to the BGP research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating the Impact of BGP Prefix Hijacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02346v1)** | 2021-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP prefix hijacking is a critical threat to the resilience and security of communications in the Internet. While several mechanisms have been proposed to prevent, detect or mitigate hijacking events, it has not been studied how to accurately quantify the impact of an ongoing hijack. When detecting a hijack, existing methods do not estimate how many networks in the Internet are affected (before and/or after its mitigation). In this paper, we study fundamental and practical aspects of the problem of estimating the impact of an ongoing hijack through network measurements. We derive analytical results for the involved trade-offs and limits, and investigate the performance of different measurement approaches (control/data-plane measurements) and use of public measurement infrastructure. Our findings provide useful insights for the design of accurate hijack impact estimation methodologies. Based on these insights, we design (i) a lightweight and practical estimation methodology that employs ping measurements, and (ii) an estimator that employs public infrastructure measurements and eliminates correlations between them to improve the accuracy. We validate the proposed methodologies and findings against results from hijacking experiments we conduct in the real Internet.</p></details> | <details><summary>IFIP ...</summary><p>IFIP Networking conference 2021</p></details> |
| **[Performance Analysis of Multipath BGP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07683v2)** | 2021-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multipath BGP (M-BGP) allows a BGP router to install multiple 'equally-good' paths, via parallel inter-domain border links, to a destination prefix. M-BGP differs from the multipath routing techniques in many ways, e.g. M-BGP is only implemented at border routers of Autonomous Systems (ASes); and while it shares traffic to different IP addresses in a destination prefix via different border links, any traffic to a given destination IP always follows the same border link. Recently we studied Looking Glass data and reported the wide deployment of M-BGP in the Internet; in particular, Hurricane Electric (AS6939) has implemented over 1,000 cases of M-BGP to hundreds of its peering ASes. In this paper, we analyzed the performance of M-BGP. We used RIPE Atlas to send traceroute probes to a series of destination prefixes through Hurricane Electric's border routers implemented with M-BGP. We examined the distribution of Round Trip Time to each probed IP address in a destination prefix and their variation during the measurement. We observed that the deployment of M-BGP can guarantee stable routing between ASes and enhance a network's resilience to traffic changes. Our work provides insights into the unique characteristics of M-BGP as an effective technique for load balancing.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2021</p></details> |
| **[BGPeek-a-Boo: Active BGP-based Traceback for Amplification DDoS Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08440v1)** | 2021-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amplification DDoS attacks inherently rely on IP spoofing to steer attack traffic to the victim. At the same time, IP spoofing undermines prosecution, as the originating attack infrastructure remains hidden. Researchers have therefore proposed various mechanisms to trace back amplification attacks (or IP-spoofed attacks in general). However, existing traceback techniques require either the cooperation of external parties or a priori knowledge about the attacker. We propose BGPeek-a-Boo, a BGP-based approach to trace back amplification attacks to their origin network. BGPeek-a-Boo monitors amplification attacks with honeypots and uses BGP poisoning to temporarily shut down ingress traffic from selected Autonomous Systems. By systematically probing the entire AS space, we detect systems forwarding and originating spoofed traffic. We then show how a graph-based model of BGP route propagation can reduce the search space, resulting in a 5x median speed-up and over 20x for 1/4 of all cases. BGPeek-a-Boo achieves a unique traceback result 60% of the time in a simulation-based evaluation supported by real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th I...</summary><p>6th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P) 2021 ; \copyright 2021 IEEE.

| **[Using Bursty Announcements for Detecting BGP Routing Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05835v2)** | 2021-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the robust structure of the Internet, it is still susceptible to disruptive routing updates that prevent network traffic from reaching its destination. Our research shows that BGP announcements that are associated with disruptive updates tend to occur in groups of relatively high frequency, followed by periods of infrequent activity. We hypothesize that we may use these bursty characteristics to detect anomalous routing incidents. In this work, we use manually verified ground truth metadata and volume of announcements as a baseline measure, and propose a burstiness measure that detects prior anomalous incidents with high recall and better precision than the volume baseline. We quantify the burstiness of inter-arrival times around the date and times of four large-scale incidents: the Indosat hijacking event in April 2014, the Telecom Malaysia leak in June 2015, the Bharti Airtel Ltd. hijack in November 2015, and the MainOne leak in November 2018; and three smaller scale incidents that led to traffic interception: the Belarusian traffic direction in February 2013, the Icelandic traffic direction in July 2013, and the Russian telecom that hijacked financial services in April 2017. Our method leverages the burstiness of disruptive update messages to detect these incidents. We describe limitations, open challenges, and how this method can be used for routing anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, 4 table</p></details> |
| **[Anatomy of Multipath BGP Deployment in a Large ISP Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07730v1)** | 2020-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multipath routing is useful for networks to achieve load sharing among multiple routing paths. Multipath BGP (MBGP) is a technique to realize inter-domain multipath routing by enabling a BGP router to install multiple equally-good routes to a destination prefix. Most of previous works did not distinguish between intra-domain and inter-domain multipath routing. In this paper, we present a measurement study on the deployment of M-BGP in a large Internet service provider (ISP) network. Our method combines control-plane BGP measurements using Looking Glasses (LG), and data-plane traceroute measurements using RIPE Atlas. We focus on Hurricane Electric (AS6939) because it is a global ISP that connects with hundreds of major exchange points and exchanges IP traffic with thousands of different networks. And more importantly, we find that this ISP has by far the largest number of M-BGP deployments among autonomous systems with LG servers. Specifically, Hurricane Electric has deployed M-BGP with 512 of its peering ASes at 58 PoPs around the world, including many top ASes and content providers. We also observe that most of its M-BGP deployments involve IXP interconnections. Our work provides insights into the latest deployment of M-BGP in a major ISP network and it highlights the characteristics and effectiveness of M-BGP as a means to realize load sharing.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures; TMA 2020 conference, http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/tma/tma2020/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Flexsealing BGP Against Route Leaks: Peerlock Active Measurement and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06576v5)** | 2020-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP route leaks frequently precipitate serious disruptions to interdomain routing. These incidents have plagued the Internet for decades while deployment and usability issues cripple efforts to mitigate the problem. Peerlock, introduced in 2016, addresses route leaks with a new approach. Peerlock enables filtering agreements between transit providers to protect their own networks without the need for broad cooperation or a trust infrastructure. We outline the Peerlock system and one variant, Peerlock-lite, and conduct live Internet experiments to measure their deployment on the control plane. Our measurements find evidence for significant Peerlock protection between Tier 1 networks in the peering clique, where 48% of potential Peerlock filters are deployed, and reveal that many other networks also deploy filters against Tier 1 leaks. To guide further deployment, we also quantify Peerlock's impact on route leaks both at currently observed levels and under hypothetical future deployment scenarios via BGP simulation. These experiments reveal present Peerlock deployment restricts Tier 1 leak export to 10% or fewer networks for 40% of simulated leaks. Strategic additional Peerlock-lite deployment at all large ISPs (fewer than 1% of all networks), in tandem with Peerlock within the peering clique as deployed, completely mitigates 80% of simulated Tier 1 route leaks.</p></details> | NDSS 2021 |
| **[Keep your Communities Clean: Exploring the Routing Message Impact of BGP Communities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00745v3)** | 2020-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP communities are widely used to tag prefix aggregates for policy, traffic engineering, and inter-AS signaling. Because individual ASes define their own community semantics, many ASes blindly propagate communities they do not recognize. Prior research has shown the potential security vulnerabilities when communities are not filtered. This work sheds light on a second unintended side-effect of communities and permissive propagation: an increase in unnecessary BGP routing messages. Due to its transitive property, a change in the community attribute induces update messages throughout established routes, just updating communities. We ground our work by characterizing the handling of updates with communities, including when filtered, on multiple real-world BGP implementations in controlled laboratory experiments. We then examine 10 years of BGP messages observed in the wild at two route collector systems. In 2020, approximately 25% of all announcements modify the community attribute, but retain the AS path of the most recent announcement; an additional 25% update neither community nor AS path. Using predictable beacon prefixes, we demonstrate that communities lead to an increase in update messages both at the tagging AS and at neighboring ASes that neither add nor filter communities. This effect is prominent for geolocation communities during path exploration: on a single day, 63% of all unique community attributes are revealed exclusively due to global withdrawals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Withdrawing the BGP Re-Routing Curtain: Understanding the Security Impact of BGP Poisoning via Real-World Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03716v6)** | 2020-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The security of the Internet's routing infrastructure has underpinned much of the past two decades of distributed systems security research. However, the converse is increasingly true. Routing and path decisions are now important for the security properties of systems built on top of the Internet. In particular, BGP poisoning leverages the de facto routing protocol between Autonomous Systems (ASes) to maneuver the return paths of upstream networks onto previously unusable, new paths. These new paths can be used to avoid congestion, censors, geo-political boundaries, or any feature of the topology which can be expressed at an AS-level. Given the increase in BGP poisoning usage as a security primitive, we set out to evaluate poisoning feasibility in practice beyond simulation. To that end, using an Internet-scale measurement infrastructure, we capture and analyze over 1,400 instances of BGP poisoning across thousands of ASes as a mechanism to maneuver return paths of traffic. We analyze in detail the performance of steering paths, the graph-theoretic aspects of available paths, and re-evaluate simulated systems with this data. We find that the real-world evidence does not completely support the findings from simulated systems published in the literature. We also analyze filtering of BGP poisoning across types of ASes and ISP working groups. We explore the connectivity concerns when poisoning by reproducing a decade old experiment to uncover the current state of an Internet triple the size. We build predictive models for understanding an ASes' vulnerability to poisoning. Finally, an exhaustive measurement of an upper bound on the maximum path length of the Internet is presented, detailing how security research should react to ASes leveraging poisoned long paths. In total, our results and analysis expose the real-world impact of BGP poisoning on past and future security research.</p></details> | NDSS 2020 |

It is important to make these components, like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), secure and work without any interruption. All of the aforementioned components have vulnerabilities, mainly because of their dependence on the centralized parties, that should be resolved. Blockchain is revolutionizing the concept of today's Internet, primarily because of its degree of decentralization and security properties. In this paper, we discuss how blockchain provides nearly complete solutions to the open challenges for these network backbone components.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 2 Figures, ISC Turkey</p></details> |
| **[The Maestro Attack: Orchestrating Malicious Flows with BGP](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07673v1)** | 2019-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Maestro attack, a novel Link Flooding Attack (LFA) that leverages control-plane traffic engineering techniques to concentrate botnet-sourced Distributed Denial of Service flows on transit links. Executed from a compromised or malicious Autonomous System (AS), Maestro advertises specific-prefix routes poisoned for selected ASes to collapse inbound traffic paths onto a single target link. A greedy heuristic fed by publicly available AS relationship data iteratively builds the set of ASes to poison. Given a compromised BGP speaker with advantageous positioning relative to the target link in the Internet topology, an adversary can expect to enhance total flow density by more than 30%. For a large botnet (e.g., Mirai), that translates to augmenting a DDoS by more than a million additional infected hosts. Interestingly, the size of the adversary-controlled AS plays little role in this amplification effect. Devastating attacks on core links can be executed by small, resource-limited ASes. To understand the scope of the attack, we evaluate widespread Internet link vulnerability across several metrics, including BGP betweenness and botnet flow density. We then assess where an adversary must be positioned to execute the attack most successfully. Finally, we present effective mitigations for network operators seeking to insulate themselves from this attack.</p></details> | In-submission |

One of them is (sub)prefix hijacking. IETF standardizes RPKI to validate the AS origin but RPKI has a lot of problems\cite{heilman2014consent}\cite{cooper2013risk}\cite{gilad2017we}\cite{gilad2017maxlength}, among which is potential false alarm. Although some previous work\cite{gilad2017we}\cite{heilman2014consent} points it out explicitly or implicitly, further measurement and analysis remain to be done. Our work measures and analyzes the invalid prefixes systematically. We first classify the invalid prefixes into six different types and then analyze their stability. We show that a large proportion of the invalid prefixes very likely result from traffic engineering, IP address transfer and failing to aggregate rather than real hijackings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management(IM) 2019 as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[ARTEMIS: Neutralizing BGP Hijacking within a Minute](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01085v4)** | 2018-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP prefix hijacking is a critical threat to Internet organizations and users. Despite the availability of several defense approaches (ranging from RPKI to popular third-party services), none of them solves the problem adequately in practice. In fact, they suffer from: (i) lack of detection comprehensiveness, allowing sophisticated attackers to evade detection, (ii) limited accuracy, especially in the case of third-party detection, (iii) delayed verification and mitigation of incidents, reaching up to days, and (iv) lack of privacy and of flexibility in post-hijack counteractions, on the side of network operators. In this work, we propose ARTEMIS (Automatic and Real-Time dEtection and MItigation System), a defense approach (a) based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly available BGP monitoring services and their recent shift towards real-time streaming, thus (b) enabling flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events. Compared to previous work, our approach combines characteristics desirable to network operators such as comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, and flexibility. Finally, we show through real-world experiments that, with the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be neutralized within a minute.</p></details> |  |
| **[CommunityWatch: The Swiss-Army Knife of BGP Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07476v1)** | 2018-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CommunityWatch, an open-source system that enables timely and accurate detection of BGP routing anomalies. CommunityWatch leverages meta-data encoded by AS operators on their advertised routes through the BGP Communities attribute. The BGP Communities values lack standardized semantics, offering the flexibility to attach a wide range of information, including AS relationships, location data, and route redistribution policies. Therefore, parsing and correlating Community values and their dynamics enables the detection and tracking of a variety of routing anomalies. We exhibit the efficacy of CommunityWatch through the detection of three different types of anomalies: infrastructure outages, route leaks, and traffic blackholing.</p></details> |  |

Several mechanisms or modifications to BGP that protect the Internet against it have been proposed. However, the reality is that most operators have not deployed them and are reluctant to do so in the near future. Instead, they rely on basic - and often inefficient - proactive defenses to reduce the impact of hijacking events, or on detection based on third party services and reactive approaches that might take up to several hours. In this work, we present the results of a survey we conducted among 75 network operators to study: (a) the operators' awareness of BGP prefix hijacking attacks, (b) presently used defenses (if any) against BGP prefix hijacking, (c) the willingness to adopt new defense mechanisms, and (d) reasons that may hinder the deployment of BGP prefix hijacking defenses. We expect the findings of this survey to increase the understanding of existing BGP hijacking defenses and the needs of network operators, as well as contribute towards designing new defense mechanisms that satisfy the requirements of the operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for BGP Abnormal Events Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03453v1)** | 2017-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection of abnormal BGP events is of great importance to preserve the security and robustness of the Internet inter-domain routing system. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on machine learning techniques to identify the anomalous events by training a model for normal BGP-updates and measuring the extent of deviation from the normal model during the abnormal occasions. Our preliminary results show that the features generated and selected are capable of improving the classification results to distinguish between anomalies and normal BGP update messages. Furthermore, the clustering results demonstrate the effectiveness of formed models to detect the similar types of BGP anomalies. In a more general context, an interdisciplinary research is performed between network security and data mining to deal with real-world problems and the achieved results are promising.</p></details> |  |

Alongside significant on-going research and development efforts, there is a practical need to understand the nature of events that occur on the Internet. Network operators are acutely aware of security-related incidents such as 'Prefix Hijacking' as well as the impact of network instabilities that ripple through the Internet. Recent research focused on the study of BGP anomalies (both network/prefix instability and security-related incidents) has been based on the analysis of historical logs. Further analysis to understand the nature of these anomalous events is not always sufficient to be able to differentiate malicious activities, such as prefix- or sub-prefix- hijacking, from those events caused by inadvertent misconfigurations. In addition, such techniques are challenged by a lack of sufficient resources to store and process data feeds in real-time from multiple BGP Vantage Points (VPs). In this paper, we present a BGP Deep-analysis application developed using the PNDA (Platform for Network Data Analytics) 'Big-Data' platform. PNDA provides a highly scalable environment that enables the ingestion and processing of 'live' BGP feeds from many vantage points in a schema-agnostic manner. The Apache Spark-based application, in conjunction with PNDA's distributed processing capabilities, is able to perform high-level insights as well as near-to-real-time statistical analysis</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 Tables, submitted to ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2017</p></details> |

ARTEMIS is based on the real-time monitoring of BGP data in the Internet, and software-defined networking (SDN) principles, and can completely mitigate a prefix hijacking within a few minutes (e.g., 5-6 mins in our experiments) after it has been launched.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can SDN Accelerate BGP Convergence? A Performance Analysis of Inter-domain Routing Centralization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00188v1)** | 2017-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet is composed of Autonomous Systems (ASes) or domains, i.e., networks belonging to different administrative entities. Routing between domains/ASes is realised in a distributed way, over the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Despite its global adoption, BGP has several shortcomings, like slow convergence after routing changes, which can cause packet losses and interrupt communication even for several minutes. To accelerate convergence, inter-domain routing centralization approaches, based on Software Defined Networking (SDN), have been recently proposed. Initial studies show that these approaches can significantly improve performance and routing control over BGP. In this paper, we complement existing system-oriented works, by analytically studying the gains of inter-domain SDN. We propose a probabilistic framework to analyse the effects of centralization on the inter-domain routing performance. We derive bounds for the time needed to establish data plane connectivity between ASes after a routing change, as well as predictions for the control-plane convergence time. Our results provide useful insights (e.g., related to the penetration of SDN in the Internet) that can facilitate future research. We discuss applications of our results, and demonstrate the gains through simulations on the Internet AS-topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Isolario: a Do-ut-des Approach to Improve the Appeal of BGP Route Collecting](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06904v1)** | 2016-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The incompleteness of data collected from BGP route collecting projects is a well-known issue which potentially affects every research activity carried out on the analysis of the Internet inter-domain routing. Recent works explained that one of the possible solutions is to increase the number of ASes feeding these projects from the Internet periphery, in order to reveal the hidden portion of peering connectivity of their upstream providers. The main problem is that these projects are currently not appealing enough for the network administrators of these ASes, which are typically not aware of their existence or not interested enough to share their data. Our contribution is Isolario, a project based on the do-ut-des principle which aims at persuading network administrators to share their routing information by offering services in return, ranging from real-time analyses of the incoming BGP session(s) to historic analyses of routing reachability. To the best of our knowledge, Isolario is the only route collecting project publicly available which offers a set of services to its users to encourage their participation, aiming at increasing the amount of BGP data publicly available for research purposes.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Evaluating the Effect of Centralization on Routing Convergence on a Hybrid BGP-SDN Emulation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03113v1)** | 2016-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A lot of applications depend on reliable and stable Internet connectivity. These characteristics are crucial for mission-critical services such as telemedical applications. An important factor that can affect connection availability is the convergence time of BGP, the de-facto inter-domain routing (IDR) protocol in the Internet. After a routing change, it may take several minutes until the network converges and BGP routing becomes stable again. Kotronis et al propose a novel Internet routing approach based on SDN principles that combines several Autonomous Systems (AS) into groups, called clusters, and introduces a logically centralized routing decision process for the cluster participants. One of the goals of this concept is to stabilize the IDR system and bring down its convergence time. However, testing whether such approaches can improve on BGP problems requires hybrid SDN and BGP experimentation tools that can emulate multiple ASes. Presently, there is a lack of an easy to use public tool for this purpose. This work fills this gap by building a suitable emulation framework and evaluating the effect that a proof-of-concept IDR controller has on IDR convergence time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM '14, pages 369-370, 1/1/2015</p></details> |
| **[Routing Centralization Across Domains via SDN: A Model and Emulation Framework for BGP Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02494v1)** | 2016-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a radical, incrementally-deployable Internet routing paradigm in which the control plane of multiple networks is centralized. This follows the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, although at the inter-domain level involving multiple Autonomous Systems (AS). Multi-domain SDN centralization can be realized by outsourcing routing functions to an external contractor, which provides inter-domain routing services facilitated through a multi-AS network controller. The proposed model promises to become a vehicle for evolving BGP and uses the bird's eye view over several networks to benefit aspects of inter-domain routing, such as convergence properties, policy conflict resolution, inter-domain troubleshooting, and collaborative security. In addition to the proposed paradigm, we introduce a publicly available emulation platform built on top of Mininet and the Quagga routing software, for experimenting in hybrid BGP-SDN AS-level networks. As a proof of concept we focus specifically on exploiting multi-domain centralization to improve BGP's slow convergence. We build and make publicly available a first multi-AS controller tailored to this use case and demonstrate experimentally that SDN centralization helps to linearly reduce BGP convergence times and churn rates with expanding SDN deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Elsev...</summary><p>Elsevier Computer Networks, Vol. 92, pages 227-239, 1/12/2015</p></details> |
| **[Monitor, Detect, Mitigate: Combating BGP Prefix Hijacking in Real-Time with ARTEMIS](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05702v1)** | 2016-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is globally used by Autonomous Systems (ASes) to establish route paths for IP prefixes in the Internet. Due to the lack of authentication in BGP, an AS can hijack IP prefixes owned by other ASes (i.e., announce illegitimate route paths), impacting thus the Internet routing system and economy. To this end, a number of hijacking detection systems have been proposed. However, existing systems are usually third party services that -inherently- introduce a significant delay between the hijacking detection (by the service) and its mitigation (by the network administrators). To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose ARTEMIS, a tool that enables an AS to timely detect hijacks on its own prefixes, and automatically proceed to mitigation actions. To evaluate the performance of ARTEMIS, we conduct real hijacking experiments. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that a hijacking detection/mitigation system is evaluated through extensive experiments in the real Internet. Our results (a) show that ARTEMIS can detect (mitigate) a hijack within a few seconds (minutes) after it has been launched, and (b) demonstrate the efficiency of the different control-plane sources used by ARTEMIS, towards monitoring routing changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEAP: Reliable Assessment of BGP Hijacking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00096v1)** | 2016-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of BGP prefix hijacking attacks has been the focus of research for more than a decade. However, state-of-the-art techniques fall short of detecting more elaborate types of attack. To study such attacks, we devise a novel formalization of Internet routing, and apply this model to routing anomalies in order to establish a comprehensive attacker model. We use this model to precisely classify attacks and to evaluate their impact and detectability. We analyze the eligibility of attack tactics that suit an attacker's goals and demonstrate that related work mostly focuses on less impactful kinds of attacks. We further propose, implement and test the Hijacking Event Analysis Program (HEAP), a new approach to investigate hijacking alarms. Our approachis designed to seamlessly integrate with previous work in order to reduce the high rates of false alarms inherent to these techniques. We leverage several unique data sources that can reliably disprove malicious intent. First, we make use of an Internet Routing Registry to derive business or organisational relationships between the parties involved in an event. Second, we use a topology-based reasoning algorithm to rule out events caused by legitimate operational practice. Finally, we use Internet-wide network scans to identify SSL/TLS-enabled hosts, which helps to identify non-malicious events by comparing public keys prior to and during an event. In our evaluation, we prove the effectiveness of our approach, and show that day-to-day routing anomalies are harmless for the most part. More importantly, we use HEAP to assess the validity of publicly reported alarms. We invite researchers to interface with HEAP in order to cross-check and narrow down their hijacking alerts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysing the Effects of Routing Centralization on BGP Convergence Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08864v1)** | 2016-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software-defined networking (SDN) has improved the routing functionality in networks like data centers or WANs. Recently, several studies proposed to apply the SDN principles in the Internet's inter-domain routing as well. This could offer new routing opportunities and improve the performance of BGP, which can take minutes to converge to routing changes. Previous works have demonstrated that centralization can benefit the functionality of BGP, and improve its slow convergence that causes severe packet losses and performance degradation. However, due to (a) the fact that previous works mainly focus on system design aspects, and (b) the lack of real deployments, it is not clearly understood yet to what extent inter-domain SDN can improve performance. To this end, in this work, we make the first effort towards analytically studying the effects of routing centralization on the performance of inter-domain routing, and, in particular, the convergence time of BGP. Specifically, we propose a Markovian model for inter-domain networks, where a subset of nodes (domains) coordinate to centralize their inter-domain routing. We then derive analytic results that quantify the BGP convergence time under various network settings (like, SDN penetration, topology, BGP configuration, etc.). Our analysis and results facilitate the performance evaluation of inter-domain SDN networks, which have been studied (till now) only through simulations/emulations that are known to suffer from high time/resource requirements and limited scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAIR: Using Formal Languages to Study Routing, Leaking, and Interception in BGP](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00618v1)** | 2016-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet routing protocol BGP expresses topological reachability and policy-based decisions simultaneously in path vectors. A complete view on the Internet backbone routing is given by the collection of all valid routes, which is infeasible to obtain due to information hiding of BGP, the lack of omnipresent collection points, and data complexity. Commonly, graph-based data models are used to represent the Internet topology from a given set of BGP routing tables but fall short of explaining policy contexts. As a consequence, routing anomalies such as route leaks and interception attacks cannot be explained with graphs. In this paper, we use formal languages to represent the global routing system in a rigorous model. Our CAIR framework translates BGP announcements into a finite route language that allows for the incremental construction of minimal route automata. CAIR preserves route diversity, is highly efficient, and well-suited to monitor BGP path changes in real-time. We formally derive implementable search patterns for route leaks and interception attacks. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we can detect these incidents. In practical experiments, we analyze public BGP data over the last seven years.</p></details> |  |
| **[An SDN-based approach to enhance BGP security](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06924v2)** | 2016-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP is vulnerable to a series of attacks. Many solutions have been proposed in the past two decades, but the most effective remain largely undeployed. This is due to three fundamental reasons: the solutions are too computationally expensive for current routers, they require changes to BGP, and/or they do not give the right incentives to promote deployment. In this abstract we propose a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture to secure BGP routing. Our solution, BGPSecX, targets an IXP and it includes techniques to allow different IXPs to collaborate. With SDN we remove the computational burden from routers and do not make changes to BGP. Targeting IXPs and promoting inter-IXP collaboration enables the creation of incentives to foster adoption of BGP security services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable BGP Prefix Selection for Effective Inter-domain Traffic Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08344v1)** | 2015-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inter-domain Traffic Engineering for multi-homed networks faces a scalability challenge, as the size of BGP routing table continue to grow. In this context, the choice of the best path must be made potentially for each destination prefix, requiring all available paths to be characterised (e.g., through measurements) and compared with each other. Fortunately, it is well-known that a few number of prefixes carry the larger part of the traffic. As a natural consequence, to engineer large volume of traffic only few prefixes need to be managed. Yet, traffic characteristics of a given prefix can greatly vary over time, and little is known on the dynamism of traffic at this aggregation level, including predicting the set of the most significant prefixes in the near future. %based on past observations. Sophisticated prediction methods won't scale in such context. In this paper, we study the relationship between prefix volume, stability, and predictability, based on recent traffic traces from nine different networks. Three simple and resource-efficient methods to select the prefixes associated with the most important foreseeable traffic volume are then proposed. Such proposed methods allow to select sets of prefixes with both excellent representativeness (volume coverage) and stability in time, for which the best routes are identified. The analysis carried out confirm the potential benefits of a route decision engine.</p></details> |  |

Each of previously investigated method solves a part of the problem. In this study, we try to complement the map by exploring the use of BGP communities. With BGP community based polices enabled in transit provider networks, we are able to manipulate incoming traffic for stub Autonomous System (AS) in a finer granularity than known techniques by customizing the AS-paths perceived by remote networks. We analyze the constraints using this technique, along with its effectiveness and granularity.</p></details> |  |
| **[From BGP to RTT and Beyond: Matching BGP Routing Changes and Network Delay Variations with an Eye on Traceroute Paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0632v1)** | 2013-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many organizations have the mission of assessing the quality of broadband access services offered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). They deploy network probes that periodically perform network measures towards selected Internet services. By analyzing the data collected by the probes it is often possible to gain a reasonable estimate of the bandwidth made available by the ISP. However, it is much more difficult to use such data to explain who is responsible of the fluctuations of other network qualities. This is especially true for latency, that is fundamental for several nowadays network services. On the other hand, there are many publicly accessible BGP routers that collect the history of routing changes and that are good candidates to be used for understanding if latency fluctuations depend on interdomain routing. In this paper we provide a methodology that, given a probe that is located inside the network of an ISP and that executes latency measures and given a set of publicly accessible BGP routers located inside the same ISP, decides which routers are best candidates (if any) for studying the relationship between variations of network performance recorded by the probe and interdomain routing changes. We validate the methodology with experimental studies based on data gathered by the RIPE NCC, an organization that is well-known to be independent and that publishes both BGP data within the Routing Information Service (RIS) and probe measurement data within the Atlas project.</p></details> |  |
| **[BGP Security in Partial Deployment: Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2690v1)** | 2013-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i.e., S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in "partial deployment" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.</p></details> |  |

In these conditions, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the inter-domain routing protocol of the Internet starts to show its limits, among others in terms of the number of routing table entries it can dynamically process and control. To overcome this challenging situation, the design but also the evaluation of alternative dynamic routing models and their comparison with BGP shall be performed by means of simulation. For this purpose, DRMSim, a Dynamic Routing Model Simulator, was developed that provides the means for large-scale simulations of various routing models including BGP. By means of this discrete-event simulator, execution of path-vector routing, e.g. BGP, and other compact routing models have been successfully performed on network topologies comprising more than ten thousand (abstract) nodes. However, to simulate dynamic routing schemes like BGP, DRMSim needs enhancements to support current Internet size (40k ASs) and even more by considering its evolution (up to 100k ASs). This paper proposes a feasibility study of the extension of DRMSim so as to support the Distributed Parallel Discrete Event paradigm. We first detail the possible distribution models and their associated communication overhead. Then, we analyze the communication overhead of such a distributed simulator by executing BGP on a partitioned topology according to different scenarios. Finally, we conclude on the feasibility of such a simulator by computing the expected additional time required by a distributed simulation of BGP compared to its sequential simulation.</p></details> |  |

As proved by recent research contributions, even S-BGP, the secure variant of BGP that is being deployed, is not fully able to blunt traffic attraction attacks. Given a traffic flow between two ASes, we study how difficult it is for a malicious AS to devise a strategy for hijacking or intercepting that flow. We show that this problem marks a sharp difference between BGP and S-BGP. Namely, while it is solvable, under reasonable assumptions, in polynomial time for the type of attacks that are usually performed in BGP, it is NP-hard for S-BGP. Our study has several by-products. E.g., we solve a problem left open in the literature, stating when performing a hijacking in S-BGP is equivalent to performing an interception.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages with 6 figures</p></details> |

We accumulate BGP data from RouteViews, RIPE RIS and the public Route Servers in August 2010 and February 2011. Based on the routing policies extracted from data of the two BGP attributes, we obtain AS relationships for 39% links in our data, which include all links among the Tier-1 ASes and most links between Tier-1 and Tier-2 ASes. We also reveal a number of special AS relationships, namely the hybrid relationship, the partial-transit relationship, the indirect peering relationship and the backup links. These special relationships are relevant to a better understanding of the Internet routing.

Generally speaking, BGP has been proven to be secure, efficient, scalable, and robust. However, with the rapid evolving of the Internet in the past few decades, there are increasing concerns about BGS's ability to meet the needs of the Internet routing. There are two major limitations of BGP which are its failure to address several key security issues, and some operational related problems. The design and ubiquity of BGP have complicated past efforts at securing inter-domain routing. This paper surveys the past work related to BGP security and operational issues. We explore the limitations and advantages of proposed solutions in these two limitations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Preference Games and Personalized Equilibria, with Applications to Fractional BGP](http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0598v2)** | 2008-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of computing equilibria in two classes of network games based on flows - fractional BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) games and fractional BBC (Bounded Budget Connection) games. BGP is the glue that holds the Internet together and hence its stability, i.e. the equilibria of fractional BGP games (Haxell, Wilfong), is a matter of practical importance. BBC games (Laoutaris et al) follow in the tradition of the large body of work on network formation games and capture a variety of applications ranging from social networks and overlay networks to peer-to-peer networks. The central result of this paper is that there are no fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (unless PPAD is in FP) for computing equilibria in both fractional BGP games and fractional BBC games. We obtain this result by proving the hardness for a new and surprisingly simple game, the fractional preference game, which is reducible to both fractional BGP and BBC games. We define a new flow-based notion of equilibrium for matrix games -- personalized equilibria -- generalizing both fractional BBC and fractional BGP games. We prove not just the existence, but the existence of rational personalized equilibria for all matrix games, which implies the existence of rational equilibria for fractional BGP and BBC games. In particular, this provides an alternative proof and strengthening of the main result in [Haxell, Wilfong]. For k-player matrix games, where k = 2, we provide a combinatorial characterization leading to a polynomial-time algorithm for computing all personalized equilibria. For k >= 5, we prove that personalized equilibria are PPAD-hard to approximate in fully polynomial time. We believe that the concept of personalized equilibria has potential for real-world significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, v2: minor editorial changes</p></details> |

We examine the recently reported rich-club phenomenon, alternative routing paths and attack tolerance. We point out that the majority of the missing links of the original maps are the connecting links between rich nodes (nodes with large numbers of links) of the extended maps. We show that the missing links are relevant because links between rich nodes can be crucial for the network structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>PAM20...</summary><p>PAM2003 - The Passive and Active Measurement Workshop(http://www.pam2003.org), San Diego, USA, April 2003</p></details> |

| **[Latency-Aware Inter-domain Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13019v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite efforts from cloud and content providers to lower latency to acceptable levels for current and future services (e.g., augmented reality or cloud gaming), there are still opportunities for improvement. A major reason that traffic engineering efforts are challenged to lower latency is that the Internet's inter-domain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol, is oblivious to any performance metric, and circuitous routing is still pervasive. In this work, we propose two implementation modifications that networks can leverage to make BGP latency-aware and reduce excessive latency inflation. These proposals, latency-proportional AS prepending and local preference neutralization, show promise towards providing a method for propagating abstract latency information with a reasonable increase in routing overhead.</p></details> |  |

| **[Global BGP Attacks that Evade Route Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09622v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the deployment of comprehensive Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) security measures is still in progress, BGP monitoring continues to play a critical role in protecting the Internet from routing attacks. Fundamentally, monitoring involves observing BGP feeds to detect suspicious announcements and taking defensive action. However, BGP monitoring relies on seeing the malicious BGP announcement in the first place! In this paper, we develop a novel attack that can hide itself from all state-of-the-art BGP monitoring systems we tested while affecting the entire Internet. The attack involves launching a sub-prefix hijack with the RFC-specified NO_EXPORT community attached to prevent networks with the malicious route installed from sending the route to BGP monitoring systems. We study the viability of this attack at four tier-1 networks and find all networks we studied were vulnerable to the attack. Finally, we propose a mitigation that significantly improves the robustness of the BGP monitoring ecosystem. Our paper aims to raise awareness of this issue and offer guidance to providers to protect against such attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Secure Inter-domain Routing and Forwarding via Verifiable Forwarding Commitments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13271v2)** | 2023-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet inter-domain routing system is vulnerable. On the control plane, the de facto Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) does not have built-in mechanisms to authenticate routing announcements, so an adversary can announce virtually arbitrary paths to hijack network traffic; on the data plane, it is difficult to ensure that actual forwarding path complies with the control plane decisions. The community has proposed significant research to secure the routing system. Yet, existing secure BGP protocols (e.g., BGPsec) are not incrementally deployable, and existing path authorization protocols are not compatible with the current Internet routing infrastructure. In this paper, we propose FC-BGP, the first secure Internet inter-domain routing system that can simultaneously authenticate BGP announcements and validate data plane forwarding in an efficient and incrementally-deployable manner. FC-BGP is built upon a novel primitive, name Forwarding Commitment, to certify an AS's routing intent on its directly connected hops. We analyze the security benefits of FC-BGP in the Internet at different deployment rates. Further, we implement a prototype of FC-BGP and extensively evaluate it over a large-scale overlay network with 100 virtual machines deployed globally. The results demonstrate that FC-BGP saves roughly 55% of the overhead required to validate BGP announcements compared with BGPsec, and meanwhile FC-BGP introduces a small overhead for building a globally-consistent view on the desirable forwarding paths.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Creating a Secure Underlay for the Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06879v2)** | 2022-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversaries can exploit inter-domain routing vulnerabilities to intercept communication and compromise the security of critical Internet applications. Meanwhile the deployment of secure routing solutions such as Border Gateway Protocol Security (BGPsec) and Scalability, Control and Isolation On Next-generation networks (SCION) are still limited. How can we leverage emerging secure routing backbones and extend their security properties to the broader Internet? We design and deploy an architecture to bootstrap secure routing. Our key insight is to abstract the secure routing backbone as a virtual Autonomous System (AS), called Secure Backbone AS (SBAS). While SBAS appears as one AS to the Internet, it is a federated network where routes are exchanged between participants using a secure backbone. SBAS makes BGP announcements for its customers' IP prefixes at multiple locations (referred to as Points of Presence or PoPs) allowing traffic from non-participating hosts to be routed to a nearby SBAS PoP (where it is then routed over the secure backbone to the true prefix owner). In this manner, we are the first to integrate a federated secure non-BGP routing backbone with the BGP-speaking Internet. We present a real-world deployment of our architecture that uses SCIONLab to emulate the secure backbone and the PEERING framework to make BGP announcements to the Internet. A combination of real-world attacks and Internet-scale simulations shows that SBAS substantially reduces the threat of routing attacks. Finally, we survey network operators to better understand optimal governance and incentive models.</p></details> | Usenix Security 2022 |
| **[Cutting Through the Noise to Infer Autonomous System Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07328v1)** | 2022-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a distributed protocol that manages interdomain routing without requiring a centralized record of which autonomous systems (ASes) connect to which others. Many methods have been devised to infer the AS topology from publicly available BGP data, but none provide a general way to handle the fact that the data are notoriously incomplete and subject to error. This paper describes a method for reliably inferring AS-level connectivity in the presence of measurement error using Bayesian statistical inference acting on BGP routing tables from multiple vantage points. We employ a novel approach for counting AS adjacency observations in the AS-PATH attribute data from public route collectors, along with a Bayesian algorithm to generate a statistical estimate of the AS-level network. Our approach also gives us a way to evaluate the accuracy of existing reconstruction methods and to identify advantageous locations for new route collectors or vantage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[A Multi-View Framework for BGP Anomaly Detection via Graph Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12793v1)** | 2021-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the default protocol for exchanging routing reachability information on the Internet, the abnormal behavior in traffic of Border Gateway Protocols (BGP) is closely related to Internet anomaly events. The BGP anomalous detection model ensures stable routing services on the Internet through its real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities. Previous studies either focused on the feature selection problem or the memory characteristic in data, while ignoring the relationship between features and the precise time correlation in feature (whether it's long or short term dependence). In this paper, we propose a multi-view model for capturing anomalous behaviors from BGP update traffic, in which Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method is used to reduce the noise in the original time-series data, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to discover feature relationships and time correlations in feature, respectively. Our results outperform the state-of-the-art methods at the anomaly detection task, with the average F1 score up to 96.3% and 93.2% on the balanced and imbalanced datasets respectively. Meanwhile, our model can be extended to classify multiple anomalous and to detect unknown events.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

In essence, BlockJack provides synchronization among BlockChain and BGP network through interfaces ensuring operational independence and this approach preserving the legacy system and accommodates the impact of a race condition if the Blockchain process exceeds the BGP update interval. BlockJack is also resilient to dynamic routing path changes during the occurrence of the IP prefix hijacking in the routing tables. We implement BlockJack using Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain and Quagga software package and we perform initial sets of experiments to evaluate its efficacy. We evaluate the performance and resilience of BlockJack in various attack scenarios including single path attacks, multiple path attacks, and attacks from random sources in the random network topology. The Evaluation results show that BlockJack is able to handle multiple attacks caused by AS paths changes during a BGP prefix hijacking. In experiment settings with 50 random routers, BlockJack takes on average 0.08 seconds (with a standard deviation of 0.04 seconds) to block BGP prefix hijacking attacks. The test result showing that BlockJack conservative approach feasible to handle the IP Prefix hijacking in the Border Gateway Protocol.</p></details> |  |
| **[APVAS: Reducing Memory Size of AS\_PATH Validation by Using Aggregate Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13346v1)** | 2020-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The \textit{BGPsec} protocol, which is an extension of the border gateway protocol (BGP), uses digital signatures to guarantee the validity of routing information. However, BGPsec's use of digital signatures in routing information causes a lack of memory in BGP routers and therefore creates a gaping security hole in today's Internet. This problem hinders the practical realization and implementation of BGPsec. In this paper, we present APVAS (AS path validation based on aggregate signatures), a new validation method that reduces memory consumption of BGPsec when validating paths in routing information. To do this, APVAS relies on a novel aggregate signature scheme that compresses individually generated signatures into a single signature in two ways, i.e., in sequential and interactive fashions. Furthermore, we implement a prototype of APVAS on \textit{BIRD Internet Routing Daemon} and demonstrate its efficiency on actual BGP connections. Our results show that APVAS can reduce memory consumption by 80\% in comparison with the conventional BGPsec.</p></details> |  |

Inferring the Deployment of Source Address Validation of Inbound Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00441v1)** | 2020-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper concerns the problem of the absence of ingress filtering at the network edge, one of the main causes of important network security issues. Numerous network operators do not deploy the best current practice - Source Address Validation (SAV) that aims at mitigating these issues. We perform the first Internet-wide active measurement study to enumerate networks not filtering incoming packets by their source address. The measurement method consists of identifying closed and open DNS resolvers handling requests coming from the outside of the network with the source address from the range assigned inside the network under the test. The proposed method provides the most complete picture of the inbound SAV deployment state at network providers. We reveal that 32 673 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and 197 641 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) prefixes are vulnerable to spoofing of inbound traffic. Finally, using the data from the Spoofer project and performing an open resolver scan, we compare the filtering policies in both directions.</p></details> |  |

It is important to make these components, like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), secure and work without any interruption. All of the aforementioned components have vulnerabilities, mainly because of their dependence on the centralized parties, that should be resolved. Blockchain is revolutionizing the concept of today's Internet, primarily because of its degree of decentralization and security properties. In this paper, we discuss how blockchain provides nearly complete solutions to the open challenges for these network backbone components.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 2 Figures, ISC Turkey</p></details> |
| **[The geopolitics behind the routes data travels: a case study of Iran](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07723v2)** | 2019-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global expansion of the Internet has brought many challenges to geopolitics. Cyberspace is a space of strategic priority for many states. Understanding and representing its geography remains an ongoing challenge. Nevertheless, we need to comprehend Cyberspace as a space organized by humans to analyse the strategies of the actors. This geography requires a multidisciplinary dialogue associating geopolitics, computer science and mathematics. Cyberspace is represented as three superposed and interacting layers: the physical, logical, and informational layers. This paper focuses on the logical layer through an analysis of the structure of connectivity and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This protocol determines the routes taken by the data. It has been leveraged by countries to control the flow of information, and to block the access to contents (going up to full disruption of the internet) or for active strategic purposes such as hijacking traffic or attacking infrastructures. Several countries have opted for a BGP strategy. The goal of this study is to characterize these strategies, to link them to current architectures and to understand their resilience in times of crisis. Our hypothesis is that there are connections between the network architecture shaped through BGP, and strategy of stakeholders at a national level. We chose to focus on the case of Iran because, Iran presents an interesting BGP architecture and holds a central position in the connectivity of the Middle East. Moreover, Iran is at the center of several ongoing geopolitical rifts. Our observations make it possible to infer three ways in which Iran could have used BGP to achieve its strategic goals: the pursuit of a self-sustaining national Internet with controlled borders; the will to set up an Iranian Intranet to facilitate censorship; and the leverage of connectivity as a tool of regional influence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validating IP Prefixes and AS-Paths with Blockchains](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03172v1)** | 2019-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks (Autonomous Systems-AS) allocate or revoke IP prefixes with the intervention of official Internet resource number authorities, and select and advertise policy-compliant paths towards these prefixes using the inter-domain routing system and its primary enabler, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Securing BGP has been a long-term objective of several research and industrial efforts during the last decades, that have culminated in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for the cryptographic verification of prefix-to-AS assignments. However, there is still no widely adopted solution for securing IP prefixes and the (AS-)paths leading to them; approaches such as BGPsec have seen minuscule deployment. In this work, we design and implement a Blockchain-based system that (i) can be used to validate both of these resource types, (ii) can work passively and does not require any changes in the inter-domain routing system (BGP, RPKI), and (iii) can be combined with currently available systems for the detection and mitigation of routing attacks. We present early results and insights w.r.t. scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>draft...</summary><p>draft report on BGP blockchain PoC</p></details> |
| **[The (thin) Bridges of AS Connectivity: Measuring Dependency using AS Hegemony](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02805v1)** | 2017-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inter-domain routing is a crucial part of the Internet designed for arbitrary policies, economical models, and topologies. This versatility translates into a substantially complex system that is hard to comprehend. Monitoring the inter-domain routing infrastructure is however essential for understanding the current state of the Internet and improving it. In this paper we design a methodology to answer two simple questions: Which are the common transit networks used to reach a certain AS? How much does this AS depends on these transit networks? To answer these questions we digest AS paths advertised with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) into AS graphs and measure node centrality, that is the likelihood of an AS to lie on paths between two other ASes. Our proposal relies solely on the AS hegemony metric, a new way to quantify node centrality while taking into account the bias towards the partial view offered by BGP. Our analysis using 14 years of BGP data refines our knowledge on Internet flattening but also exhibits the consolidated position of tier-1 networks in today's IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. We also study the connectivity to two content providers (Google and Akamai) and investigate the AS dependency of networks hosting DNS root servers. These case studies emphasize the benefits of the proposed method to assist ISPs in planning and assessing infrastructure deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Near Real-Time BGP Deep Analysis: A Big-Data Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08666v1)** | 2017-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) serves as the primary routing protocol for the Internet, enabling Autonomous Systems (individual network operators) to exchange network reachability information. Alongside significant on-going research and development efforts, there is a practical need to understand the nature of events that occur on the Internet. Network operators are acutely aware of security-related incidents such as 'Prefix Hijacking' as well as the impact of network instabilities that ripple through the Internet. Recent research focused on the study of BGP anomalies (both network/prefix instability and security-related incidents) has been based on the analysis of historical logs. Further analysis to understand the nature of these anomalous events is not always sufficient to be able to differentiate malicious activities, such as prefix- or sub-prefix- hijacking, from those events caused by inadvertent misconfigurations. In addition, such techniques are challenged by a lack of sufficient resources to store and process data feeds in real-time from multiple BGP Vantage Points (VPs). In this paper, we present a BGP Deep-analysis application developed using the PNDA (Platform for Network Data Analytics) 'Big-Data' platform. PNDA provides a highly scalable environment that enables the ingestion and processing of 'live' BGP feeds from many vantage points in a schema-agnostic manner. The Apache Spark-based application, in conjunction with PNDA's distributed processing capabilities, is able to perform high-level insights as well as near-to-real-time statistical analysis</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 Tables, submitted to ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2017</p></details> |
| **[Can SDN Accelerate BGP Convergence? A Performance Analysis of Inter-domain Routing Centralization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00188v1)** | 2017-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet is composed of Autonomous Systems (ASes) or domains, i.e., networks belonging to different administrative entities. Routing between domains/ASes is realised in a distributed way, over the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Despite its global adoption, BGP has several shortcomings, like slow convergence after routing changes, which can cause packet losses and interrupt communication even for several minutes. To accelerate convergence, inter-domain routing centralization approaches, based on Software Defined Networking (SDN), have been recently proposed. Initial studies show that these approaches can significantly improve performance and routing control over BGP. In this paper, we complement existing system-oriented works, by analytically studying the gains of inter-domain SDN. We propose a probabilistic framework to analyse the effects of centralization on the inter-domain routing performance. We derive bounds for the time needed to establish data plane connectivity between ASes after a routing change, as well as predictions for the control-plane convergence time. Our results provide useful insights (e.g., related to the penetration of SDN in the Internet) that can facilitate future research. We discuss applications of our results, and demonstrate the gains through simulations on the Internet AS-topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitor, Detect, Mitigate: Combating BGP Prefix Hijacking in Real-Time with ARTEMIS](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05702v1)** | 2016-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is globally used by Autonomous Systems (ASes) to establish route paths for IP prefixes in the Internet. Due to the lack of authentication in BGP, an AS can hijack IP prefixes owned by other ASes (i.e., announce illegitimate route paths), impacting thus the Internet routing system and economy. To this end, a number of hijacking detection systems have been proposed. However, existing systems are usually third party services that -inherently- introduce a significant delay between the hijacking detection (by the service) and its mitigation (by the network administrators). To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose ARTEMIS, a tool that enables an AS to timely detect hijacks on its own prefixes, and automatically proceed to mitigation actions. To evaluate the performance of ARTEMIS, we conduct real hijacking experiments. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that a hijacking detection/mitigation system is evaluated through extensive experiments in the real Internet. Our results (a) show that ARTEMIS can detect (mitigate) a hijack within a few seconds (minutes) after it has been launched, and (b) demonstrate the efficiency of the different control-plane sources used by ARTEMIS, towards monitoring routing changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Range Correlations and Memory in the Dynamics of Internet Interdomain Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07299v2)** | 2015-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data transfer is one of the main functions of the Internet. The Internet consists of a large number of interconnected subnetworks or domains, known as Autonomous Systems. Due to privacy and other reasons the information about what route to use to reach devices within other Autonomous Systems is not readily available to any given Autonomous System. The Border Gateway Protocol is responsible for discovering and distributing this reachability information to all Autonomous Systems. Since the topology of the Internet is highly dynamic, all Autonomous Systems constantly exchange and update this reachability information in small chunks, known as routing control packets or Border Gateway Protocol updates. Motivated by scalability and predictability issues with the dynamics of these updates in the quickly growing Internet, we conduct a systematic time series analysis of Border Gateway Protocol update rates. We find that Border Gateway Protocol update time series are extremely volatile, exhibit long-term correlations and memory effects, similar to seismic time series, or temperature and stock market price fluctuations. The presented statistical characterization of Border Gateway Protocol update dynamics could serve as a ground truth for validation of existing and developing better models of Internet interdomain routing.</p></details> |  |

Each of previously investigated method solves a part of the problem. In this study, we try to complement the map by exploring the use of BGP communities. With BGP community based polices enabled in transit provider networks, we are able to manipulate incoming traffic for stub Autonomous System (AS) in a finer granularity than known techniques by customizing the AS-paths perceived by remote networks. We analyze the constraints using this technique, along with its effectiveness and granularity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Alternate Paths in the Internet:A Survey of Techniques for End-to-End Path Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8125v1)** | 2013-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet provides physical path diversity between a large number of hosts, making it possible for networks to use alternative paths when one path fails to deliver the required Quality of Service. However, for various reasons, many established protocols (e.g. de facto Internet inter-domain routing protocol, Border-Gateway Protocol - BGP) do not fully exploit such alternate paths. This paper surveys research into techniques for discovering end-to-end alternate paths, including those based on monitoring path performance, choosing paths that are maximally disjoint, and in routing across multiple paths. It surveys proposals for making BGP better able to exploit multiple paths and how multi-homing can create alternate paths. It also describes how alternate paths can be realized through detour routing (application layer mechanisms) and routing deflections (network layer mechanisms). It also discusses Fast Re-Route techniques for construction of backup routes. It concludes by surveying open research issues into the discovery and use of alternate paths in the Internet.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

In these conditions, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the inter-domain routing protocol of the Internet starts to show its limits, among others in terms of the number of routing table entries it can dynamically process and control. To overcome this challenging situation, the design but also the evaluation of alternative dynamic routing models and their comparison with BGP shall be performed by means of simulation. For this purpose, DRMSim, a Dynamic Routing Model Simulator, was developed that provides the means for large-scale simulations of various routing models including BGP. By means of this discrete-event simulator, execution of path-vector routing, e.g. BGP, and other compact routing models have been successfully performed on network topologies comprising more than ten thousand (abstract) nodes. However, to simulate dynamic routing schemes like BGP, DRMSim needs enhancements to support current Internet size (40k ASs) and even more by considering its evolution (up to 100k ASs). This paper proposes a feasibility study of the extension of DRMSim so as to support the Distributed Parallel Discrete Event paradigm. We first detail the possible distribution models and their associated communication overhead. Then, we analyze the communication overhead of such a distributed simulator by executing BGP on a partitioned topology according to different scenarios. Finally, we conclude on the feasibility of such a simulator by computing the expected additional time required by a distributed simulation of BGP compared to its sequential simulation.</p></details> |  |

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) starts to show its limits in terms of the number of routing table entries it can dynamically process and control. Due to the increasing routing information processing and storage, the same trend is observed for routing model simulators such as DRMSim specialized in large-scale simulations of routing models. Therefore, DRMSim needs enhancements to support the current size of the Internet topology and its evolution (up to 100k ASs). To this end, this paper proposes a feasibility study of the extension of DRMSim so as to support the Distributed Parallel Discrete Event paradigm.

| **[Network-Destabilizing Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1681v2)** | 2012-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sets up routes between the smaller networks that make up the Internet. Despite its crucial role, BGP is notoriously vulnerable to serious problems, including (1) propagation of bogus routing information due to attacks or misconfigurations, and (2) network instabilities in the form of persistent routing oscillations. The conditions required to avoid BGP instabilities are quite delicate. How, then, can we explain the observed stability of today's Internet in the face of common configuration errors and attacks? This work explains this phenomenon by first noticing that almost every observed attack and misconfiguration to date shares a common characteristic: even when a router announces egregiously bogus information, it will continue to announce the same bogus information for the duration of its attack/misconfiguration. We call these the "fixed-route attacks", and show that, while even simple fixed-route attacks can destabilize a network, the commercial routing policies used in today's Internet prevent such attacks from creating instabilities.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |

Routers in a domain forward IP packet within and between domains. Each domain uses an intra-domain routing protocol known as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) like IS-IS, OSPF, RIP etc to populate the routing tables of its routers. Routing information must also be exchanged between domains to ensure that a host in one domain can reach another host in remote domain. This role is performed by inter-domain routing protocol called Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP). Basically EGP used these days is Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Basic difference between the both is that BGP has smaller convergence as compared to the IGP's. And IGP's on the other hand have lesser scalability as compared to the BGP. So in this paper a proposal to create a new protocol is given which can act as an IGP when we consider inter-domain transfer of traffic and acts as BGP when we consider intra-domain transfer of traffic.</p></details> | 5 Pages, 6 Figures |

As proved by recent research contributions, even S-BGP, the secure variant of BGP that is being deployed, is not fully able to blunt traffic attraction attacks. Given a traffic flow between two ASes, we study how difficult it is for a malicious AS to devise a strategy for hijacking or intercepting that flow. We show that this problem marks a sharp difference between BGP and S-BGP.

BGP is the de-facto protocol for interdomain routing on the Internet. We model BGP route distribution and computation using a game in which a BGP speaker advertises its prefix to its direct neighbors promising them a reward for further distributing the route deeper into the network, the neighbors do the same thing with their neighbors, and so on. The result of this cascaded route distribution is an advertised prefix and hence reachability of the BGP speaker. We first study the convergence of BGP protocol dynamics to a unique outcome tree in the defined game. We then proceed to study the existence of equilibria in the full information game considering competition dynamics. We focus our work on the simplest two classes of graphs: 1) the line (and the tree) graphs which involve no competition, and 2) the ring graph which involves competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 page, lncs format, 2 figures, workshop</p></details> |

| **[Preference Games and Personalized Equilibria, with Applications to Fractional BGP](http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0598v2)** | 2008-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of computing equilibria in two classes of network games based on flows - fractional BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) games and fractional BBC (Bounded Budget Connection) games. BGP is the glue that holds the Internet together and hence its stability, i.e. the equilibria of fractional BGP games (Haxell, Wilfong), is a matter of practical importance. BBC games (Laoutaris et al) follow in the tradition of the large body of work on network formation games and capture a variety of applications ranging from social networks and overlay networks to peer-to-peer networks. The central result of this paper is that there are no fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (unless PPAD is in FP) for computing equilibria in both fractional BGP games and fractional BBC games. We obtain this result by proving the hardness for a new and surprisingly simple game, the fractional preference game, which is reducible to both fractional BGP and BBC games. We define a new flow-based notion of equilibrium for matrix games -- personalized equilibria -- generalizing both fractional BBC and fractional BGP games. We prove not just the existence, but the existence of rational personalized equilibria for all matrix games, which implies the existence of rational equilibria for fractional BGP and BBC games. In particular, this provides an alternative proof and strengthening of the main result in [Haxell, Wilfong]. For k-player matrix games, where k = 2, we provide a combinatorial characterization leading to a polynomial-time algorithm for computing all personalized equilibria. For k >= 5, we prove that personalized equilibria are PPAD-hard to approximate in fully polynomial time. We believe that the concept of personalized equilibria has potential for real-world significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, v2: minor editorial changes</p></details> |

Fundamentally, monitoring involves observing BGP feeds to detect suspicious announcements and taking defensive action. However, BGP monitoring relies on seeing the malicious BGP announcement in the first place! In this paper, we develop a novel attack that can hide itself from all state-of-the-art BGP monitoring systems we tested while affecting the entire Internet. The attack involves launching a sub-prefix hijack with the RFC-specified NO_EXPORT community attached to prevent networks with the malicious route installed from sending the route to BGP monitoring systems. We study the viability of this attack at four tier-1 networks and find all networks we studied were vulnerable to the attack. Finally, we propose a mitigation that significantly improves the robustness of the BGP monitoring ecosystem. Our paper aims to raise awareness of this issue and offer guidance to providers to protect against such attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Traditional traffic monitoring mainly focuses on the local anomalous status of events due to a large amount of data. BGP-based event monitoring makes it possible to perform differential analysis of international events. For many existing traffic anomaly detection methods, we have observed that the window-based noise reduction strategy effectively improves the success rate of time series anomaly detection. Motivated by this observation, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model, MAD-MulW, which incorporates a multi-window serial framework. Firstly, we design the W-GAT module to adaptively update the sample weights within the window and retain the updated information of the trailing sample, which not only reduces the outlier samples' noise but also avoids the space consumption of data scale expansion. Then, the W-LAT module based on predictive reconstruction both captures the trend of sample fluctuations over a certain period of time and increases the interclass variation through the reconstruction of the predictive sample. Our model has been experimentally validated on multiple BGP anomalous events with an average F1 score of over 90\%, which demonstrates the significant improvement effect of the stage windows and adaptive strategy on the efficiency and stability of the timing model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Securing BGP has been a long-term objective of several research and industrial efforts during the last decades, that have culminated in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for the cryptographic verification of prefix-to-AS assignments. However, there is still no widely adopted solution for securing IP prefixes and the (AS-)paths leading to them; approaches such as BGPsec have seen minuscule deployment. In this work, we design and implement a Blockchain-based system that (i) can be used to validate both of these resource types, (ii) can work passively and does not require any changes in the inter-domain routing system (BGP, RPKI), and (iii) can be combined with currently available systems for the detection and mitigation of routing attacks.

| **[An SDN-based approach to enhance BGP security](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06924v2)** | 2016-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP is vulnerable to a series of attacks. Many solutions have been proposed in the past two decades, but the most effective remain largely undeployed. This is due to three fundamental reasons: the solutions are too computationally expensive for current routers, they require changes to BGP, and/or they do not give the right incentives to promote deployment. In this abstract we propose a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture to secure BGP routing. Our solution, BGPSecX, targets an IXP and it includes techniques to allow different IXPs to collaborate. With SDN we remove the computational burden from routers and do not make changes to BGP. Targeting IXPs and promoting inter-IXP collaboration enables the creation of incentives to foster adoption of BGP security services.</p></details> |  |
| **[BGP Security in Partial Deployment: Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2690v1)** | 2013-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i.e., S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in "partial deployment" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on BGP Issues and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4815v1)** | 2009-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BGP is the de facto protocol used for inter-autonomous system routing in the Internet. Generally speaking, BGP has been proven to be secure, efficient, scalable, and robust. However, with the rapid evolving of the Internet in the past few decades, there are increasing concerns about BGS's ability to meet the needs of the Internet routing. There are two major limitations of BGP which are its failure to address several key security issues, and some operational related problems. The design and ubiquity of BGP have complicated past efforts at securing inter-domain routing. This paper surveys the past work related to BGP security and operational issues. We explore the limitations and advantages of proposed solutions in these two limitations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning to Identify Conflicts in RPKI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03378v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long history of misconfigurations and errors in RPKI indicates that they cannot be easily avoided and will most probably persist also in the future. These errors create conflicts between BGP announcements and their covering ROAs, causing the RPKI validation to result in status invalid. Networks that enforce RPKI filtering with Route Origin Validation (ROV) would block such conflicting BGP announcements and as a result lose traffic from the corresponding origins. Since the business incentives of networks are tightly coupled with the traffic they relay, filtering legitimate traffic leads to a loss of revenue, reducing the motivation to filter invalid announcements with ROV. In this work, we introduce a new mechanism, LOV, designed for whitelisting benign conflicts on an Internet scale. The resulting whitelist is made available to RPKI supporting ASes to avoid filtering RPKI-invalid but benign routes. Saving legitimate traffic resolves one main obstacle towards RPKI deployment. We measure live BGP updates using LOV during a period of half a year and whitelist 52,846 routes with benign origin errors.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have exploited routing attacks to observe Tor traffic and deanonymize Tor users. Subsequently, location-aware relay selection algorithms have been proposed to defend against such attacks on Tor. However, location-aware relay selection algorithms are known to be vulnerable to information leakage on client locations and guard placement attacks. Can we design a new location-unaware approach to relay selection while achieving the similar goal of defending against routing attacks? Towards this end, we leverage the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) in designing new guard relay selection algorithms. We develop a lightweight Discount Selection algorithm by only incorporating Route Origin Authorization (ROA) information, and a more secure Matching Selection algorithm by incorporating both ROA and Route Origin Validation (ROV) information. Our evaluation results show an increase in the number of ROA-ROV matched client-relay pairs using our Matching Selection algorithm, reaching 48.47% with minimal performance overhead through custom Shadow simulations and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures, for data and intermediate results see: https://torstudy.cs.virginia.edu/ , to be published in Issue 2 of PoPETs 2025</p></details> |

We discuss the unique impact of this RCE on networks that use RPKI, illustrating that RCE vulnerabilities are especially severe in the context of RPKI. The design of RPKI makes RCE easy to exploit on a large scale, allows compromise of RPKI validation integrity, and enables a powerful vector for additional attacks on other critical components of the network, like the border routers. We analyze the vulnerability exposing to this RCE and identify indications that the discovered vulnerability could constitute an intentional backdoor to compromise systems running the software over a benign coding mistake.

| **[RPKI: Not Perfect But Good Enough](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14518v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) protocol was standardized to add cryptographic security to Internet routing. With over 50% of Internet resources protected with RPKI today, the protocol already impacts significant parts of Internet traffic. In addition to its growing adoption, there is also increasing political interest in RPKI. The White House indicated in its Roadmap to Enhance Internet Routing Security, on 4 September 2024, that RPKI is a mature and readily available technology for securing inter-domain routing. The Roadmap attributes the main obstacles towards wide adoption of RPKI to a lack of understanding, lack of prioritization, and administrative barriers. This work presents the first comprehensive study of the maturity of RPKI as a viable production-grade technology. We find that current RPKI implementations still lack production-grade resilience and are plagued by software vulnerabilities, inconsistent specifications, and operational challenges, raising significant security concerns. The deployments lack experience with full-fledged strict RPKI-validation in production environments and operate in fail-open test mode. We provide recommendations to improve RPKI resilience and guide stakeholders in securing their deployments against emerging threats. The numerous issues we have discovered with the current RPKI specifications and implementations inevitably lead to the question: Is RPKI sufficiently stable to align with the expectations outlined in the White House roadmap? Certainly, it is not perfect, but is it good enough? The answer, as we will explore, varies depending on one's viewpoint.</p></details> |  |

It has already been widely deployed by large providers and the adoption rate is getting to a critical point. Almost half of all the global prefixes are now covered by RPKI and measurements show that 27% of networks are already using RPKI to validate BGP announcements. Over the past 10 years, there has been much research effort in RPKI, analyzing different facets of the protocol, such as software vulnerabilities, robustness of the infrastructure or the proliferation of RPKI validation. In this work we compile the first systemic overview of the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in RPKI and quantify the security landscape of the global RPKI deployments based on our measurements and analysis. Our study discovers that 56% of the global RPKI validators suffer from at least one documented vulnerability. We also do a systematization of knowledge for existing RPKI security research and complement the existing knowledge with novel measurements in which we discover new trends in availability of RPKI repositories, and their communication patterns with the RPKI validators.

| **[Byzantine-Secure Relying Party for Resilient RPKI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00531v1)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To protect against prefix hijacks, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been standardized. To enjoy the security guarantees of RPKI validation, networks need to install a new component, the relying party validator, which fetches and validates RPKI objects and provides them to border routers. However, recent work shows that relying parties experience failures when retrieving RPKI objects and are vulnerable to attacks, all of which can disable RPKI validation. Therefore even the few adopters are not necessarily secure. We make the first proposal that significantly improves the resilience and security of RPKI. We develop BRP, a Byzantine-Secure relying party implementation. In BRP the relying party nodes redundantly validate RPKI objects and reach a global consensus through voting. BRP provides an RPKI equivalent of public DNS, removing the need for networks to install, operate, and upgrade their own relying party instances while avoiding the need to trust operators of BRP nodes. We show through simulations and experiments that BRP, as an intermediate RPKI service, results in less load on RPKI publication points and a robust output despite RPKI repository failures, jitter, and attacks. We engineer BRP to be fully backward compatible and readily deployable - it does not require any changes to the border routers and the RPKI repositories. We demonstrate that BRP can protect many networks transparently, with either a decentralized or centralized deployment. BRP can be set up as a network of decentralized volunteer deployments, similarly to NTP and TOR, where different operators participate in the peering process with their node, and provide resilient and secure relying party validation to the Internet. BRP can also be hosted by a single operator as a centralized service, e.g., on one cloud or CDN, and provides RPKI validation benefits even when hosted on a single network.</p></details> |  |
| **[The CURE To Vulnerabilities in RPKI Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01872v1)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over recent years, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has seen increasing adoption, with now 37.8% of the major networks filtering bogus BGP routes. Systems interact with the RPKI over Relying Party (RP) implementations that fetch RPKI objects and feed BGP routers with the validated prefix-ownership data. Consequently, any vulnerabilities or flaws within the RP software can substantially threaten the stability and security of Internet routing. We uncover severe flaws in all popular RP implementations, making them susceptible to path traversal attacks, remotely triggered crashes, and inherent inconsistencies, violating RPKI standards. We report a total of 18 vulnerabilities that canbe exploited to downgrade RPKI validation in border routers or, worse, enable poisoning of the validation process, resulting in malicious prefixes being wrongfully validated and legitimate RPKI-covered prefixes failing validation. Furthermore, our research discloses inconsistencies in the validation process, with two popular implementations leaving 8149 prefixes unprotected from hijacks, 6405 of which belong to Amazon. While these findings are significant in their own right, our principal contribution lies in developing CURE, the first-of-its-kind system to systematically detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and RFC compliance issues in RP implementations via automated test generation. CURE is a powerful RPKI publication point emulator that enables easy and efficient fuzzing of complex RP validation pipelines. It is designed with a set of novel techniques, utilizing differential and stateful fuzzing. We generated over 600 million test cases and tested all popular RPs on them. Following our disclosure, the vendors already assigned CVEs to the vulnerabilities we found.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NDSS '24</p></details> |

To prevent prefix hijacks, networks should deploy RPKI and filter bogus BGP announcements with invalid routes. In this work we evaluate the impact of RPKI deployments on the security and resilience of the Internet. We aim to understand which networks filter invalid routes and how effective that filtering is in blocking prefix hijacks. We extend previous data acquisition and analysis methodologies to obtain more accurate identification of networks that filter invalid routes with RPKI. We find that more than 27% of networks enforce RPKI filtering and show for the first time that deployments follow the business incentives of inter-domain routing: providers have an increased motivation to filter in order to avoid losing customers' traffic. Analyzing the effectiveness of RPKI, we find that the current trend to deploy RPKI on routeservers of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) only provides a localized protection against hijacks but has negligible impact on preventing their spread globally. In contrast, we show that RPKI filtering in Tier-1 providers greatly benefits the security of the Internet as it limits the spread of hijacks to a localized scope. Based on our observations, we provide recommendations on the future roadmap of RPKI deployment.

The key design property in RPKI that allows our attacks is the tradeoff between connectivity and security: when networks cannot retrieve RPKI information from publication points, they make routing decisions in BGP without validating RPKI. We exploit this tradeoff to develop attacks that prevent the retrieval of the RPKI objects from the public repositories, thereby disabling RPKI validation and exposing the RPKI-protected networks to prefix hijack attacks. We demonstrate experimentally that at least 47% of the public repositories are vulnerable against a specific version of our attacks, a rate-limiting off-path downgrade attack. We also show that all the current RPKI relying party implementations are vulnerable to attacks by a malicious publication point. This translates to 20.4% of the IPv4 address space. We provide recommendations for preventing our downgrade attacks. However, resolving the fundamental problem is not straightforward: if the relying parties prefer security over connectivity and insist on RPKI validation when ROAs cannot be retrieved, the victim AS may become disconnected from many more networks than just the one that the adversary wishes to hijack. Our work shows that the publication points are a critical infrastructure for Internet connectivity and security. Our main recommendation is therefore that the publication points should be hosted on robust platforms guaranteeing a high degree of connectivity.</p></details> |  |

RPKI Certificate Authorities issue these attestations and publish them at Publication Points. Relying Party software retrieves and processes the RPKI-related data from all publication points, validates the data and makes it available to routers so they can make secure routing decisions. In this work, we create a threat model for Relying Party software, where an attacker controls a Certificate Authority and Publication Point. We implement a prototype testbed to analyse how current Relying Party software implementations react to scenarios originating from that threat model. Our results show that all current Relying Party software was susceptible to at least one of the identified threats. In addition to this, we also identified threats stemming from choices made in the protocol itself. Taken together, these threats potentially allow an attacker to fully disrupt all RPKI Relying Party software on a global scale. We performed a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure to the implementers and have made our testbed software available for future studies.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, RPKI enables Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) to unilaterally takedown IP prefixes - indeed, such attacks have been launched by nation-state adversaries. The threat of IP prefix takedowns is one of the factors hindering RPKI adoption. In this work, we propose the first distributed RPKI system, based on threshold signatures, that requires the coordination of a number of RIRs to make changes to RPKI objects; hence, preventing unilateral prefix takedown. We perform extensive evaluations using our implementation demonstrating the practicality of our solution. Furthermore, we show that our system is scalable and remains efficient even when RPKI is widely deployed.</p></details> |  |

IETF standardizes RPKI to validate the AS origin but RPKI has a lot of problems\cite{heilman2014consent}\cite{cooper2013risk}\cite{gilad2017we}\cite{gilad2017maxlength}, among which is potential false alarm. Although some previous work\cite{gilad2017we}\cite{heilman2014consent} points it out explicitly or implicitly, further measurement and analysis remain to be done. Our work measures and analyzes the invalid prefixes systematically. We first classify the invalid prefixes into six different types and then analyze their stability. We show that a large proportion of the invalid prefixes very likely result from traffic engineering, IP address transfer and failing to aggregate rather than real hijackings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management(IM) 2019 as a short paper</p></details> |

Access to websites is typically secured via TLS. However, this security model does not account for prefix hijacking on the network layer, which may lead to traffic blackholing or transparent interception. Thus, to achieve comprehensive security and service availability, additional protective mechanisms are necessary such as the RPKI, a recently deployed Resource Public Key Infrastructure to prevent hijacking of traffic by networks. This paper argues two positions. First, that modern web hosting practices make route protection challenging due to the propensity to spread servers across many different networks, often with unpredictable client redirection strategies, and, second, that we need a better understanding why protection mechanisms are not deployed. To initiate this, we empirically explore the relationship between web hosting infrastructure and RPKI deployment. Perversely, we find that less popular websites are more likely to be secured than the prominent sites. Worryingly, we find many large-scale CDNs do not support RPKI, thus making their customers vulnerable. This leads us to explore business reasons why operators are hesitant to deploy RPKI, which may help to guide future research on improving Internet security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previous arXiv version of this paper has been published under the title "When BGP Security Meets Content Deployment: Measuring and Analysing RPKI-Protection of Websites", Proc. of Fourteenth ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets), New York:ACM, 2015</p></details> |

We employ the BDF2 scheme for time discretization and a conservative VEM for spatial discretization, in which the mass conservation in the velocity field is kept by taking advantage of the virtual element method's adaptability and its divergence-free characteristics. In our scheme, the nonlinear terms are handled explicitly using the SAV method, and the magnetic field is decoupled from the velocity and pressure. This decoupling only requires solving a sequence of linear systems with constant coefficient at each time step. The stability estimate of the fully discrete scheme is developed, demonstrating the scheme is unconditionally stable. Moreover, rigorous error estimates for the velocity and magnetic field are provided. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the valid of theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Both first and second order schemes are constructed. Since the positivity of the solution is closely related to entropy, we also propose positivity-preserving versions of these schemes to ensure robustness, which include a scheme specially designed for the Boltzmann equation and a more general scheme using Lagrange multipliers. The accuracy and provable entropy-dissipation properties of the proposed schemes are validated for both the Boltzmann equation and the Landau equation through extensive numerical examples.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) stabilization of implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration schemes for nonlinear structural dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02839v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration schemes are well suited for nonlinear structural dynamics because of their low computational cost and high accuracy. However, stability of IMEX schemes cannot be guaranteed for general nonlinear problems. In this article, we present a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) stabilization of high-order IMEX time integration schemes that leads to unconditional stability. The proposed IMEX-BDFk-SAV schemes treat linear terms implicitly using kth-order backward difference formulas (BDFk) and nonlinear terms explicitly. This eliminates the need for iterations in nonlinear problems and leads to low computational cost. Truncation error analysis of the proposed IMEX-BDFk-SAV schemes confirms that up to kth-order accuracy can be achieved and this is verified through a series of convergence tests. Unlike existing SAV schemes for first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a novel SAV for the proposed schemes that allows direct solution of the second-order ODEs without transforming them to a system of first-order ODEs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes by solving several nonlinear problems in structural dynamics and show that the proposed schemes can achieve high accuracy at a low computational cost while maintaining unconditional stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[High-efficiency and positivity-preserving stabilized SAV methods for gradient flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08893v1)** | 2023-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV)-type methods are very popular techniques for solving various nonlinear dissipative systems. Compared to the semi-implicit method, the baseline SAV method can keep a modified energy dissipation law but doubles the computational cost. The general SAV approach does not add additional computation but needs to solve a semi-implicit solution in advance, which may potentially compromise the accuracy and stability. In this paper, we construct a novel first- and second-order unconditional energy stable and positivity-preserving stabilized SAV (PS-SAV) schemes for $L^2$ and $H^{-1}$ gradient flows. The constructed schemes can reduce nearly half computational cost of the baseline SAV method and preserve its accuracy and stability simultaneously. Meanwhile, the introduced auxiliary variable is always positive while the baseline SAV cannot guarantee this positivity-preserving property. Unconditionally energy dissipation laws are derived for the proposed numerical schemes. We also establish a rigorous error analysis of the first-order scheme for the Allen-Cahn type equation in $l^{\infty}(0,T; H^1(\Omega) ) $ norm. In addition we propose an energy optimization technique to optimize the modified energy close to the original energy. Several interesting numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A mobility-SAV approach for a Cahn-Hilliard equation with degenerate mobilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15329v2)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel numerical strategy is introduced for computing approximations of solutions to a Cahn-Hilliard model with degenerate mobilities. This model has recently been introduced as a second-order phase-field approximation for surface diffusion flows. Its numerical discretization is challenging due to the degeneracy of the mobilities, which generally requires an implicit treatment to avoid stability issues at the price of increased complexity costs. To mitigate this drawback, we consider new first- and second-order Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) schemes that, differently from existing approaches, focus on the relaxation of the mobility, rather than the Cahn-Hilliard energy. These schemes are introduced and analysed theoretically in the general context of gradient flows and then specialised for the Cahn-Hilliard equation with mobilities. Various numerical experiments are conducted to highlight the advantages of these new schemes in terms of accuracy, effectiveness and computational cost.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |
| **[An efficient and robust SAV based algorithm for discrete gradient systems arising from optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02942v2)** | 2023-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose in this paper a new minimization algorithm based on a slightly modified version of the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach coupled with a relaxation step and an adaptive strategy. It enjoys several distinct advantages over popular gradient based methods: (i) it is unconditionally energy diminishing with a modified energy which is intrinsically related to the original energy, thus no parameter tuning is needed for stability; (ii) it allows the use of large step-sizes which can effectively accelerate the convergence rate. We also present a convergence analysis for some SAV based algorithms, which include our new algorithm without the relaxation step as a special case. We apply our new algorithm to several illustrative and benchmark problems, and compare its performance with several popular gradient based methods. The numerical results indicate that the new algorithm is very robust, and its adaptive version usually converges significantly faster than those popular gradient descent based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel energy-optimal scalar auxiliary variable (EOP-SAV) approach for gradient flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11288v1)** | 2023-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach has become very popular and hot in the design of linear, high-order and unconditional energy stable schemes of gradient flow models. However, the nature of SAV-based numerical schemes preserving modified energy dissipation limits its wider application. A relaxation technique to correct the modified energy for the baseline SAV method (RSAV) was proposed by Zhao et al. and Shen et al.. The RSAV approach is unconditionally energy stable with respect to a modified energy that is closer to the original free energy, and provides a much improved accuracy when compared with the SAV approach. In this paper, inspired by the RSAV approach, we propose a novel technique to correct the modified energy of the SAV approach, which can be proved to be an optimal energy approximation. We construct new high-order implicit-explicit schemes based on the proposed energy-optimal SAV (EOP-SAV) approach. The constructed EOP-SAV schemes not only provide an improved accuracy but also simplify calculation, and can be viewed as the optimal relaxation. We also prove that the numerical schemes based on the EOP-SAV approach are unconditionally energy stable. Compared with the RSAV approach, the proposed EOP-SAV approach does not need introduce any relaxed factors and can share the similar procedure for error estimates. Several interesting numerical examples have been presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Scala...</summary><p>Scalar auxiliary variable, Gradient flow, Relaxation, Optimal, Error analysis</p></details> |

By utilizing the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach for dealing with the convective and coupling terms, we propose some first- and second-order schemes for this system. These schemes are linear, decoupled, unconditionally energy stable, and only require solving a sequence of differential equations with constant coefficients at each time step. We further derive a rigorous error analysis for the first-order scheme, establishing optimal convergence rates for the velocity, pressure, current density and electric potential in the two-dimensional case. Numerical examples are presented to verify the theoretical findings and show the performances of the schemes.</p></details> | 26 pages, 13 figures |

They can guarantee the positive property of SAV without any assumption compared with R-SAV and R-GSAV approaches, preserve all the advantages of the ESAV approach and satiesfy dissipation law with respect to a modified energy which is directly related to the original free energy. Moreover the second version of R-ESAV approach is easy to construct high-order BDF$k$ schemes. Especially for Navier-Stokes equations, we construct wo kinds of novel schemes based on the R-ESAV method.

First, by applying a finite volume method with upwind numerical fluxes to the degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation rewritten by the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, we creatively obtain an unconditionally bound-preserving, energy-stable and fully-discrete scheme, which, for the first time, addresses the boundedness of the classical SAV approach under $H^{-1}$-gradient flow. Then, a dimensional-splitting technique is introduced in high-dimensional cases, which greatly reduces the computational complexity while preserves original structural properties. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the bound-preserving and energy-stable properties of the proposed scheme. Finally, by applying the proposed structure-preserving scheme, we numerically demonstrate that surface diffusion can be approximated by the Cahn--Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility and Flory--Huggins potential when the absolute temperature is sufficiently low, which agrees well with the theoretical result by using formal asymptotic analysis.wn theoretically by formal matched asymptotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error estimates for the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) scheme to the Cahn-Hilliard equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13555v2)** | 2022-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimal error estimate that depending only on the polynomial degree of $ \varepsilon^{-1}$ is established for the temporal semi-discrete scheme of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which is based on the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) formulation. The key to our analysis is to convert the structure of the SAV time-stepping scheme back to a form compatible with the original format of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which makes it feasible to use spectral estimates to handle the nonlinear term. Based on the transformation of the SAV numerical scheme, the optimal error estimate for the temporal semi-discrete scheme which depends only on the low polynomial order of $\varepsilon^{-1}$ instead of the exponential order, is derived by using mathematical induction, spectral arguments, and the superconvergence properties of some nonlinear terms. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the discrete energy decay property and validate our theoretical convergence analysis.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

It is proved that the modified energy dissipation law is unconditionally preserved at discrete levels. Under a mild ratio restriction, i.e., \Ass{1}: $0<r_k:=\tau_k/\tau_{k-1}< r_{\max}\approx 4.8645$, we establish a rigorous error estimate in $H^1$-norm and achieve optimal second-order accuracy in time. The proof involves the tools of discrete orthogonal convolution (DOC) kernels and inequality zoom. It is worth noting that the presented adaptive time-step scheme only requires solving one linear system with constant coefficients at each time step. In our analysis, the first-consistent BDF1 for the first step does not bring the order reduction in $H^1$-norm. The $H^1$ bound of the numerical solution under periodic boundary conditions can be derived without any restriction (such as zero mean of the initial data). Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify our theoretical analysis and the algorithm efficiency.</p></details> | 24 pages |

| **[Semi-implicit energy-preserving numerical schemes for stochastic wave equation via SAV approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13394v1)** | 2022-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose and analyze semi-implicit numerical schemes for the stochastic wave equation (SWE) with general nonlinearity and multiplicative noise. These numerical schemes, called stochastic scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) schemes, are constructed by transforming the considered SWE into a higher dimensional stochastic system with a stochastic SAV. We prove that they can be solved explicitly and preserve the modified energy evolution law and the regularity structure of the original system. These structure-preserving properties are the keys to overcoming the mutual effect of the noise and nonlinearity. By proving new regularity estimates of the introduced SAV, we establish the strong convergence rate of stochastic SAV schemes and the further fully-discrete schemes with the finite element method in spatial direction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the construction and strong convergence of semi-implicit energy-preserving schemes for nonlinear SWE.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stabilized exponential-SAV schemes preserving energy dissipation law and maximum bound principle for the Allen-Cahn type equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06829v1)** | 2022-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well-known that the Allen-Cahn equation not only satisfies the energy dissipation law but also possesses the maximum bound principle (MBP) in the sense that the absolute value of its solution is pointwise bounded for all time by some specific constant under appropriate initial/boundary conditions. In recent years, the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method and many of its variants have attracted much attention in numerical solution for gradient flow problems due to their inherent advantage of preserving certain discrete analogues of the energy dissipation law. However, existing SAV schemes usually fail to preserve the MBP when applied to the Allen-Cahn equation. In this paper, we develop and analyze new first- and second-order stabilized exponential-SAV schemes for a class of Allen-Cahn type equations, which are shown to simultaneously preserve the energy dissipation law and MBP in discrete settings. In addition, optimal error estimates for the numerical solutions are rigorously obtained for both schemes. Extensive numerical tests and comparisons are also conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized SAV-exponential integrator schemes for Allen-Cahn type gradient flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04532v1)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy dissipation law and the maximum bound principle (MBP) are two important physical features of the well-known Allen-Cahn equation. While some commonly-used first-order time stepping schemes have turned out to preserve unconditionally both energy dissipation law and MBP for the equation, restrictions on the time step size are still needed for existing second-order or even higher-order schemes in order to have such simultaneous preservation. In this paper, we develop and analyze novel first- and second-order linear numerical schemes for a class of Allen-Cahn type gradient flows. Our schemes combine the generalized scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach and the exponential time integrator with a stabilization term, while the standard central difference stencil is used for discretization of the spatial differential operator. We not only prove their unconditional preservation of the energy dissipation law and the MBP in the discrete setting, but also derive their optimal temporal error estimates under fixed spatial mesh. Numerical experiments are also carried out to demonstrate the properties and performance of the proposed schemes.</p></details> |  |

However, the discrete value of the SAV is not directly linked to the free energy of the dissipative system, and may lead to inaccurate solutions if the time step is not sufficiently small. Inspired by the relaxed SAV method proposed in \cite{jiang2022improving} for gradient flows, we propose in this paper a generalized SAV approach with relaxation (R-GSAV) for general dissipative systems. The R-GSAV approach preserves all the advantages of the GSAV appraoch, in addition, it dissipates a modified energy that is directly linked to the original free energy. We prove that the $k$-th order implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes based on R-GSAV are unconditionally energy stable, and we carry out a rigorous error analysis for $k=1,2,3,4,5$. We present ample numerical results to demonstrate the improved accuracy and effectiveness of the R-GSAV approach.</p></details> |  |

However, SAVs will also induce some negative externalities by generating excessive vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which leads to more congestions, energy consumption, and emissions. The excessive VMT are primarily generated via empty relocation process. Reinforcement Learning based algorithms are being researched as a possible solution to solve some of these problems: most notably minimizing waiting time for riders.

We carry out a rigorous error analysis for the time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation, which also fills up a gap for the classical case. Finally, numerical experiment is shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented methods.

| **[Improving the Accuracy and Consistency of the Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) Method with Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06620v1)** | 2021-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method was introduced by Shen et al. and has been broadly used to solve thermodynamically consistent PDE problems. By utilizing scalar auxiliary variables, the original PDE problems are reformulated into equivalent PDE problems. The advantages of the SAV approach, such as linearity, unconditionally energy stability, and easy-to-implement, are prevalent. However, there is still an open issue unresolved, i.e., the numerical schemes resulted from the SAV method preserve a "modified" energy law according to the auxiliary variables instead of the original variables. Truncation errors are introduced during numerical calculations so that the numerical solutions of the auxiliary variables are no longer equivalent to their original continuous definitions. In other words, even though the SAV scheme satisfies a modified energy law, it does not necessarily satisfy the energy law of the original PDE models. This paper presents one essential relaxation technique to overcome this issue, which we named the relaxed-SAV (RSAV) method. Our RSAV method penalizes the numerical errors of the auxiliary variables by a relaxation technique. In general, the RSAV method keeps all the advantages of the baseline SAV method and improves its accuracy and consistency noticeably. Several examples have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the RSAV approach.</p></details> |  |

Its primary difference with the standard phase field crystal model is an introduction of the 4-Laplacian term in the free energy potential, which in turn leads to a much higher degree of nonlinearity. To make the numerical scheme linear while preserving the nonlinear energy stability, we make use of the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, in which a second order backward differentiation formula (BDF) is applied in the temporal stencil. Meanwhile, a direct application of the SAV method faces certain difficulties, due to the involvement of the 4-Laplacian term, combined with a derivation of the lower bound of the nonlinear energy functional. In the proposed numerical method, an appropriate decomposition for the physical energy functional is formulated, so that the nonlinear energy part has a well-established global lower bound, and the rest terms lead to constant-coefficient diffusion terms with positive eigenvalues. In turn, the numerical scheme could be very efficiently implemented by constant-coefficient Poisson-like type solvers (via FFT), and energy stability is established by introducing an auxiliary variable, and an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided for the proposed SAV method. A few numerical experiments are also presented, which confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1906.12255</p></details> |

The proposed schemes are based on the L1 discretization for the time fractional derivative and the extended scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach developed very recently to deal with the nonlinear terms in the equation. The main contributions of the paper consist in: 1) constructing first and higher order unconditionally stable schemes for different mesh types, and proving the unconditional stability of the constructed schemes for the uniform mesh; 2) carrying out numerical experiments to verify the efficiency of the schemes and to investigate the coarsening dynamics governed by the time fractional Allen-Cahn equation. Particularly, the influence of the fractional order on the coarsening behavior is carefully examined. Our numerical evidence shows that the proposed schemes are more robust than the existing methods, and their efficiency is less restricted to particular forms of the nonlinear potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[A highly efficient and accurate exponential semi-implicit scalar auxiliary variable (ESI-SAV) approach for dissipative system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11728v1)** | 2020-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach is a very popular and efficient method to simulate various phase field models. To save the computational cost, a new SAV approach is given by introducing a new variable $\theta$. The new SAV approach can be proved to save nearly half CPU time of the original SAV approach while keeping all its other advantages. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to construct an exponential semi-implicit scalar auxiliary variable (ESI-SAV) approach without introducing any extra variables. The new proposed method also only needs to solve one linear equation with constant coefficients at each time step. Furthermore, the constructed ESI-SAV method does not need the bounded below restriction of nonlinear free energy potential which is more reasonable and effective for various phase field models. Meanwhile it is easy to construct first-order, second-order and higher-order unconditionally energy stable time-stepping schemes. Other than that, the ESI-SAV approach can be proved to be effective to solve the non-gradient but dissipative system such as Navier-Stokes equations. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the improved efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1912.09263, arXiv:2001.00812</p></details> |
| **[On the SAV-DG method for a class of fourth order gradient flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11877v1)** | 2020-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a class of fourth order gradient flow problems, integration of the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) time discretization with the penalty-free discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization leads to SAV-DG schemes. These schemes are linear and shown unconditionally energy stable. But the reduced linear systems are rather expensive to solve due to the dense coefficient matrices. In this paper, we provide a procedure to pre-evaluate the auxiliary variable in the piecewise polynomial space. As a result, the computational complexity of $O(\mathcal{N}^2)$ reduces to $O(\mathcal{N})$ when exploiting the conjugate gradient (CG) solver. This hybrid SAV-DG method is more efficient and able to deliver satisfactory results of high accuracy. This was also compared with solving the full augmented system of the SAV-DG schemes.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Our schemes are based on the SAV approach combined with the Lagrangian multiplier approach. They are as efficient as the SAV schemes for unconstrained gradient flows, i.e., only require solving linear equations with constant coefficients at each time step plus an additional nonlinear algebraic system which can be solved at negligible cost, can be unconditionally energy stable, and preserve exactly the global constraints for constrained gradient flows. Ample numerical results for phase-field vesicle membrane and optimal partition models are presented to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed numerical schemes.</p></details> |  |

To reduce efficiently computational cost and capture accurately the phase interface, we give a simple adaptive strategy, equipped with a posteriori gradient estimator, i.e. L 2 norm of the recovered gradient.

| **[Martians Among Us: Observing Private or Reserved IPs on the Public Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16805v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoofed traffic has been identified as one of the main issues of concern for network hygiene nowadays, as it facilitates Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by hiding their origin and complicating forensic investigations. Some indicators of poor network hygiene are packets with Bogon or Martian source addresses representing either misconfigurations or spoofed packets. Despite the development of Source Address Validation (SAV) techniques and guidelines such as BCP 38 and BCP 84, Bogons are often overlooked in the filtering practices of network operators. This study uses traceroute measurements from the CAIDA Ark dataset, enriched with historical BGP routing information from RIPE RIS and RouteViews, to investigate the prevalence of Bogon addresses over seven years (2017-2023). Our analysis reveals widespread non-compliance with best practices, with Bogon traffic detected across thousands of ASes. Notably, 82.69%-97.83% of CAIDA Ark vantage points observe paths containing Bogon IPs, primarily RFC1918 addresses. Additionally, 19.70% of all analyzed traceroutes include RFC1918 addresses, while smaller proportions involve RFC6598 (1.50%) and RFC3927 (0.10%) addresses. We identify more than 13,000 unique ASes transiting Bogon traffic, with only 11.64% appearing in more than half of the measurements. Cross-referencing with the Spoofer project and MANRS initiatives shows a concerning gap: 62.67% of ASes that do not filter packets with Bogon sources are marked as non-spoofable, suggesting incomplete SAV implementation. Our contributions include an assessment of network hygiene using the transiting of Bogon packets as a metric, an analysis of the main types of Bogon addresses found in traceroutes, and several proposed recommendations to address the observed gaps, enforcing the need for stronger compliance with best practices to improve global network security.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multicast Scheme for Live Streaming Courses in Large-Scale, Geographically Dense Campus Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06334v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video courses have become a significant component of modern education. However, the increasing demand for live streaming video courses places considerable strain on the service capabilities of campus networks. The challenges associated with live streaming course videos in campus network environments exhibit distinct spatial distribution characteristics. The audience for specific video courses may be highly concentrated in certain areas, leading to a large number of users attempting to access the same live stream simultaneously. Utilizing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute videos in these campus scenarios creates substantial unicast pressure on edge CDN servers. This paper proposes a two-layer dynamic partitioning Recursive Bit String (RBS) virtual domain network layer multicast architecture specifically designed for large-scale, geographically dense multicast scenarios within campus networks. This approach reduces redundant multicast messages by approximately 10-30\% compared to the two-layer fixed partitioning method. Additionally, it establishes multicast source authentication capabilities based on Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) and facilitates secure multicast group key exchange using a concise exchange protocol within the WebRTC framework. In the next-generation data plane of programmable software-defined networks, the RBS stateless multicast technology can be integrated with the unique characteristics of large-scale, geographically dense campus network scenarios to dynamically and efficiently extend multicast coverage to every dormitory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guardians of DNS Integrity: A Remote Method for Identifying DNSSEC Validators Across the Internet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19851v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide the most effective way to fight DNS cache poisoning attacks. Yet, very few DNS resolvers perform DNSSEC validation. Identifying such systems is non-trivial and the existing methods are not suitable for Internet-scale measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel remote technique for identifying DNSSEC-validating resolvers. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, we identify open resolvers by scanning 3.1 billion end hosts and request every non-forwarder to resolve one correct and seven deliberately misconfigured domains. We then build a classifier that discriminates validators from non-validators based on query patterns and DNS response codes. We find that while most open resolvers are DNSSEC-enabled, less than 18% in IPv4 (38% in IPv6) validate received responses. In the second step, we remotely identify closed non-forwarders in networks that do not have inbound Source Address Validation (SAV) in place. Using the classifier built in step one, we identify 37.4% IPv4 (42.9% IPv6) closed DNSSEC validators and cross-validate the results using RIPE Atlas probes. Finally, we show that the discovered (non)-validators actively send requests to DNS root servers, suggesting that we deal with operational recursive resolvers rather than misconfigured machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Router is My Prober: Measuring IPv6 Networks via ICMP Rate Limiting Side Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13088v3)** | 2023-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active Internet measurements face challenges when some measurements require many remote vantage points. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for measuring remote IPv6 networks via side channels in ICMP rate limiting, a required function for IPv6 nodes to limit the rate at which ICMP error messages are generated. This technique, iVantage, can to some extent use 1.1M remote routers distributed in 9.5k autonomous systems and 182 countries as our "vantage points". We apply iVantage to two different, but both challenging measurement tasks: 1) measuring the deployment of inbound source address validation (ISAV) and 2) measuring reachability between arbitrary Internet nodes. We accomplish these two tasks from only one local vantage point without controlling the targets or relying on other services within the target networks. Our large-scale ISAV measurements cover ~50% of all IPv6 autonomous systems and find ~79% of them are vulnerable to spoofing, which is the most large-scale measurement study of IPv6 ISAV to date. Our method for reachability measurements achieves over 80% precision and recall in our evaluation. Finally, we perform an Internet-wide measurement of the ICMP rate limiting implementations, present a detailed discussion on ICMP rate limiting, particularly the potential security and privacy risks in the mechanism of ICMP rate limiting, and provide possible mitigation measures. We make our code available to the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Closed Resolver Project: Measuring the Deployment of Source Address Validation of Inbound Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05277v2)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source Address Validation (SAV) is a standard aimed at discarding packets with spoofed source IP addresses. The absence of SAV for outgoing traffic has been known as a root cause of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and received widespread attention. While less obvious, the absence of inbound filtering enables an attacker to appear as an internal host of a network and may reveal valuable information about the network infrastructure. Inbound IP spoofing may amplify other attack vectors such as DNS cache poisoning or the recently discovered NXNSAttack. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of the Closed Resolver Project that aims at mitigating the problem of inbound IP spoofing. We perform the first Internet-wide active measurement study to enumerate networks that filter or do not filter incoming packets by their source address, for both the IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces. To achieve this, we identify closed and open DNS resolvers that accept spoofed requests coming from the outside of their network. The proposed method provides the most complete picture of inbound SAV deployment by network providers. Our measurements cover over 55 % IPv4 and 27 % IPv6 Autonomous Systems (AS) and reveal that the great majority of them are fully or partially vulnerable to inbound spoofing. By identifying dual-stacked DNS resolvers, we additionally show that inbound filtering is less often deployed for IPv6 than it is for IPv4. Overall, we discover 13.9 K IPv6 open resolvers that can be exploited for amplification DDoS attacks - 13 times more than previous work. Furthermore, we enumerate uncover 4.25 M IPv4 and 103 K IPv6 vulnerable closed resolvers that could only be detected thanks to our spoofing technique, and that pose a significant threat when combined with the NXNSAttack.</p></details> |  |

| **[Subverting Stateful Firewalls with Protocol States (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09604v5)** | 2022-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyzed the generation of protocol header fields in the implementations of multiple TCP/IP network stacks and found new ways to leak information about global protocol states. We then demonstrated new covert channels by remotely observing and modifying the system's global state via these protocol fields. Unlike earlier works, our research focuses on hosts that reside in firewalled networks (including source address validation -- SAV), which is a very common scenario nowadays. Our attacks are designed to be non-disruptive -- in the exfiltration scenario, this makes the attacks stealthier and thus extends their longevity, and in case of host alias resolution and similar techniques -- this ensures the techniques are ethical. We focused on ICMP, which is commonly served by firewalls, and on UDP, which is forecasted to take a more prominent share of the Internet traffic with the advent of HTTP/3 and QUIC, though we report results for TCP as well. The information leakage scenarios we discovered enable the construction of practical covert channels which directly pierce firewalls, or indirectly establish communication via hosts in firewalled networks that also employ SAV. We describe and test three novel attacks in this context: exfiltration via the firewall itself, exfiltration via a DMZ host, and exfiltration via co-resident containers. These are three generic, new use cases for covert channels that work around firewalling and enable devices that are not allowed direct communication with the Internet, to still exfiltrate data out of the network. In other words, we exfiltrate data from isolated networks to the Internet. We also explain how to mount known attacks such as host alias resolution, de-NATting and container co-residence detection, using the new information leakage techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this paper is to be presented in NDSS 2022.

Inferring the Deployment of Source Address Validation of Inbound Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00441v1)** | 2020-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper concerns the problem of the absence of ingress filtering at the network edge, one of the main causes of important network security issues. Numerous network operators do not deploy the best current practice - Source Address Validation (SAV) that aims at mitigating these issues. We perform the first Internet-wide active measurement study to enumerate networks not filtering incoming packets by their source address. The measurement method consists of identifying closed and open DNS resolvers handling requests coming from the outside of the network with the source address from the range assigned inside the network under the test. The proposed method provides the most complete picture of the inbound SAV deployment state at network providers. We reveal that 32 673 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and 197 641 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) prefixes are vulnerable to spoofing of inbound traffic. Finally, using the data from the Spoofer project and performing an open resolver scan, we compare the filtering policies in both directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeZone: A Hierarchical Inter-Domain Authenticated Source Address Validation Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3766v1)** | 2011-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next generation Internet is highly concerned about the issue of reliability. Principally, the foundation of reliability is authentication of the source IP address. With the signature-and-verification based defense mechanisms available today, unfortunately, there is a lack of hierarchical architecture, which makes the structure of the trust alliance excessively flat and single. Moreover, with the increasing scale of the trust alliance, costs of validation grow so quickly that they do not adapt to incremental deployment. Via comparison with traditional solutions, this article proposes a hierarchical, inter-domain authenticated source address validation solution named SafeZone. SafeZone employs two intelligent designs, lightweight tag replacement and a hierarchical partitioning scheme, each of which helps to ensure that SafeZone can construct trustworthy and hierarchical trust alliances without the negative influences and complex operations on de facto networks. Extensive experiments also indicate that SafeZone can effectively obtain the design goals of a hierarchical architecture, along with lightweight, loose coupling and "multi-fence support" and as well as an incremental deployment scheme.</p></details> |  |
