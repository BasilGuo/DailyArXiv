| **[On the Regularization of Learnable Embeddings for Time Series Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14630v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In processing multiple time series, accounting for the individual features of each sequence can be challenging. To address this, modern deep learning methods for time series analysis combine a shared (global) model with local layers, specific to each time series, often implemented as learnable embeddings. Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful representations of the unique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these are learned end-to-end as parameters of a forecasting model, they may end up acting as mere sequence identifiers. Shared processing blocks may then become reliant on such identifiers, limiting their transferability to new contexts. In this paper, we address this issue by investigating methods to regularize the learning of local learnable embeddings for time series processing. Specifically, we perform the first extensive empirical study on the subject and show how such regularizations consistently improve performance in widely adopted architectures. Furthermore, we show that methods preventing the co-adaptation of local and global parameters are particularly effective in this context. This hypothesis is validated by comparing several methods preventing the downstream models from relying on sequence identifiers, going as far as completely resetting the embeddings during training. The obtained results provide an important contribution to understanding the interplay between learnable local parameters and shared processing layers: a key challenge in modern time series processing models and a step toward developing effective foundation models for time series.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear how these models will influence financial markets, especially when they infer financial value in a semi-autonomous way. In this work, we explore the interplay between deep generative models and market dynamics. We develop a form of virtual traders that use deep generative models to make buy/sell decisions, which we term neuro-symbolic traders, and expose them to a virtual market. Under our framework, neuro-symbolic traders are agents that use vision-language models to discover a model of the fundamental value of an asset. Agents develop this model as a stochastic differential equation, calibrated to market data using gradient descent. We test our neuro-symbolic traders on both synthetic data and real financial time series, including an equity stock, commodity, and a foreign exchange pair. We then expose several groups of neuro-symbolic traders to a virtual market environment. This market environment allows for feedback between the traders belief of the underlying value to the observed price dynamics. We find that this leads to price suppression compared to the historical data, highlighting a future risk to market stability. Our work is a first step towards quantifying the effect of deep generative agents on markets dynamics and sets out some of the potential risks and benefits of this approach in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, ACM format</p></details> |
| **[Clustering of timed sequences -- Application to the analysis of care pathways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15379v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the future of healthcare starts by better understanding the current actual practices in hospital settings. This motivates the objective of discovering typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing typical care pathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care pathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a semantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms. In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to the clustering of timed sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed sequences. This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANT: Adaptive Noise Schedule for Time Series Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14488v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in diffusion models for generative artificial intelligence have recently propagated to the time series (TS) domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, prior works on TS diffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other domains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Adaptive Noise schedule for Time series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper noise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing non-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should satisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity of TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is corrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is sufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it eliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small additional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done offline before training. We validate the effectiveness of our method across various tasks, including TS forecasting, refinement, and generation, on datasets from diverse domains. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/seunghan96/ANT.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Predicting time-varying flux and balance in metabolic systems using structured neural-ODE processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14426v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a novel data-driven framework as an alternative to dynamic flux balance analysis, bypassing the demand for deep domain knowledge and manual efforts to formulate the optimization problem. The proposed framework is end-to-end, which trains a structured neural ODE process (SNODEP) model to estimate flux and balance samples using gene-expression time-series data. SNODEP is designed to circumvent the limitations of the standard neural ODE process model, including restricting the latent and decoder sampling distributions to be normal and lacking structure between context points for calculating the latent, thus more suitable for modeling the underlying dynamics of a metabolic system. Through comprehensive experiments ($156$ in total), we demonstrate that SNODEP not only predicts the unseen time points of real-world gene-expression data and the flux and balance estimates well but can even generalize to more challenging unseen knockout configurations and irregular data sampling scenarios, all essential for metabolic pathway analysis. We hope our work can serve as a catalyst for building more scalable and powerful models for genome-scale metabolic analysis. Our code is available at: \url{https://github.com/TrustMLRG/SNODEP}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timeseria: an object-oriented time series processing library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09567v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timeseria is an object-oriented time series processing library implemented in Python, which aims at making it easier to manipulate time series data and to build statistical and machine learning models on top of it. Unlike common data analysis frameworks, it builds up from well defined and reusable logical units (objects), which can be easily combined together in order to ensure a high level of consistency. Thanks to this approach, Timeseria can address by design several non-trivial issues often underestimated, such as handling data losses, non-uniform sampling rates, differences between aggregated data and punctual observations, time zones, daylight saving times, and more. Timeseria comes with a comprehensive set of base data structures, common data manipulation operations, and extensible models for data reconstruction, forecasting and anomaly detection. It also integrates a powerful plotting engine capable of handling even millions of data points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the trajectory of intracranial pressure in patients with traumatic brain injury: evaluation of a foundation model for time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14333v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience pathological increases in intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to intracranial hypertension (tIH), a common and serious complication. Early warning of an impending rise in ICP could potentially improve patient outcomes by enabling preemptive clinical intervention. However, the limited availability of patient data poses a challenge in developing reliable prediction models. In this study, we aim to determine whether foundation models, which leverage transfer learning, may offer a promising solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[wavScalogram: an R package with wavelet scalogram tools for time series analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14274v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we present the wavScalogram R package, which contains methods based on wavelet scalograms for time series analysis. These methods are related to two main wavelet tools: the windowed scalogram difference and the scale index. The windowed scalogram difference compares two time series, identifying if their scalograms follow similar patterns at different scales and times, and it is thus a useful complement to other comparison tools such as the squared wavelet coherence. On the other hand, the scale index provides a numerical estimation of the degree of non-periodicity of a time series and it is widely used in many scientific areas.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |
| **[SatSwinMAE: Efficient Autoencoding for Multiscale Time-series Satellite Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02512v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have significantly impacted various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks. One area that stands to benefit greatly is Earth observation, where these models can efficiently process large-scale, unlabeled geospatial data. In this work we extend the SwinMAE model to integrate temporal information for satellite time-series data. The architecture employs a hierarchical 3D Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks to effectively capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies in satellite imagery. To enhance transfer learning, we incorporate both encoder and decoder pretrained weights, along with skip connections to preserve scale-specific information. This forms an architecture similar to SwinUNet with an additional temporal component. Our approach shows significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art foundation models for all the evaluated downstream tasks: land cover segmentation, building density prediction, flood mapping, wildfire scar mapping and multi-temporal crop segmentation. Particularly, in the land cover segmentation task of the PhilEO Bench dataset, it outperforms other geospatial foundation models with a 10.4% higher accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[On time series clustering with k-means](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14269v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a long history of research into time series clustering using distance-based partitional clustering. Many of the most popular algorithms adapt k-means (also known as Lloyd's algorithm) to exploit time dependencies in the data by specifying a time series distance function. However, these algorithms are often presented with k-means configured in various ways, altering key parameters such as the initialisation strategy. This variability makes it difficult to compare studies because k-means is known to be highly sensitive to its configuration. To address this, we propose a standard Lloyd's-based model for TSCL that adopts an end-to-end approach, incorporating a specialised distance function not only in the assignment step but also in the initialisation and stopping criteria. By doing so, we create a unified structure for comparing seven popular Lloyd's-based TSCL algorithms. This common framework enables us to more easily attribute differences in clustering performance to the distance function itself, rather than variations in the k-means configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost-Linear RNNs Yield Highly Interpretable Symbolic Codes in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14240v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems (DS) theory is fundamental for many areas of science and engineering. It can provide deep insights into the behavior of systems evolving in time, as typically described by differential or recursive equations. A common approach to facilitate mathematical tractability and interpretability of DS models involves decomposing nonlinear DS into multiple linear DS separated by switching manifolds, i.e. piecewise linear (PWL) systems. PWL models are popular in engineering and a frequent choice in mathematics for analyzing the topological properties of DS. However, hand-crafting such models is tedious and only possible for very low-dimensional scenarios, while inferring them from data usually gives rise to unnecessarily complex representations with very many linear subregions. Here we introduce Almost-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) which automatically and robustly produce most parsimonious PWL representations of DS from time series data, using as few PWL nonlinearities as possible. AL-RNNs can be efficiently trained with any SOTA algorithm for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), and naturally give rise to a symbolic encoding of the underlying DS that provably preserves important topological properties. We show that for the Lorenz and R\"ossler systems, AL-RNNs discover, in a purely data-driven way, the known topologically minimal PWL representations of the corresponding chaotic attractors. We further illustrate on two challenging empirical datasets that interpretable symbolic encodings of the dynamics can be achieved, tremendously facilitating mathematical and computational analysis of the underlying systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[XForecast: Evaluating Natural Language Explanations for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14180v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting aids decision-making, especially for stakeholders who rely on accurate predictions, making it very important to understand and explain these models to ensure informed decisions. Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which underline feature or temporal importance, often require expert knowledge. In contrast, natural language explanations (NLEs) are more accessible to laypeople. However, evaluating forecast NLEs is difficult due to the complex causal relationships in time series data. To address this, we introduce two new performance metrics based on simulatability, assessing how well a human surrogate can predict model forecasts using the explanations. Experiments show these metrics differentiate good from poor explanations and align with human judgments. Utilizing these metrics, we further evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for time series data, finding that numerical reasoning, rather than model size, is the main factor influencing explanation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Granger Causality in Extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09632v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a rigorous mathematical framework for Granger causality in extremes, designed to identify causal links from extreme events in time series. Granger causality plays a pivotal role in uncovering directional relationships among time-varying variables. While this notion gains heightened importance during extreme and highly volatile periods, state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on causality within the body of the distribution, often overlooking causal mechanisms that manifest only during extreme events. Our framework is designed to infer causality mainly from extreme events by leveraging the causal tail coefficient. We establish equivalences between causality in extremes and other causal concepts, including (classical) Granger causality, Sims causality, and structural causality. We prove other key properties of Granger causality in extremes and show that the framework is especially helpful under the presence of hidden confounders. We also propose a novel inference method for detecting the presence of Granger causality in extremes from data. Our method is model-free, can handle non-linear and high-dimensional time series, outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in all considered setups, both in performance and speed, and was found to uncover coherent effects when applied to financial and extreme weather observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368v3)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM. Code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/thuml/Large-Time-Series-Model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Conditional Multi-Task Learning for Streamflow Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14137v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streamflow, vital for water resource management, is governed by complex hydrological systems involving intermediate processes driven by meteorological forces. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results of streamflow prediction, their end-to-end single-task learning approach often fails to capture the causal relationships within these systems. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Conditional Multi-Task Learning (HCMTL), a hierarchical approach that jointly models soil water and snowpack processes based on their causal connections to streamflow. HCMTL utilizes task embeddings to connect network modules, enhancing flexibility and expressiveness while capturing unobserved processes beyond soil water and snowpack. It also incorporates the Conditional Mini-Batch strategy to improve long time series modeling. We compare HCMTL with five baselines on a global dataset. HCMTL's superior performance across hundreds of drainage basins over extended periods shows that integrating domain-specific causal knowledge into deep learning enhances both prediction accuracy and interpretability. This is essential for advancing our understanding of complex hydrological systems and supporting efficient water resource management to mitigate natural disasters like droughts and floods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Learning on Transformers for Building Energy Consumption Forecasting -- A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14107v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the application of Transfer Learning (TL) on Transformer architectures to enhance building energy consumption forecasting. Transformers are a relatively new deep learning architecture, which has served as the foundation for groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT. While TL has been studied in the past, these studies considered either one TL strategy or used older deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks. Here, we carry out an extensive empirical study on six different TL strategies and analyse their performance under varying feature spaces. In addition to the vanilla Transformer architecture, we also experiment with Informer and PatchTST, specifically designed for time series forecasting. We use 16 datasets from the Building Data Genome Project 2 to create building energy consumption forecasting models. Experiment results reveal that while TL is generally beneficial, especially when the target domain has no data, careful selection of the exact TL strategy should be made to gain the maximum benefit. This decision largely depends on the feature space properties such as the recorded weather features. We also note that PatchTST outperforms the other two Transformer variants (vanilla Transformer and Informer). We believe our findings would assist researchers in making informed decision in using TL and transformer architectures for building energy consumption forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Flows for Unveiling Systemic Interactions Among Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14030v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting systems are prevalent in nature. It is challenging to accurately predict the dynamics of the system if its constituent components are analyzed independently. We develop a graph-based model that unveils the systemic interactions of time series observed at irregular time points, by using a directed acyclic graph to model the conditional dependencies (a form of causal notation) of the system components and learning this graph in tandem with a continuous-time model that parameterizes the solution curves of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our technique, a graph neural flow, leads to substantial enhancements over non-graph-based methods, as well as graph-based methods without the modeling of conditional dependencies. We validate our approach on several tasks, including time series classification and forecasting, to demonstrate its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Recurrent Neural Goodness-of-Fit Test for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13986v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are crucial across diverse domains such as finance and healthcare, where accurate forecasting and decision-making rely on advanced modeling techniques. While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Islanding Detection for Active Distribution Networks Using WaveNet+UNet Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13926v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an AI-based scheme for islanding detection in active distribution networks. By reviewing existing studies, it is clear that there are several gaps in the field to ensure reliable islanding detection, including (i) model complexity and stability concerns, (ii) limited accuracy under noisy conditions, and (iii) limited applicability to systems with different types of resources. Accordingly, this paper proposes a WaveNet classifier reinforced by a denoising U-Net model to address these shortcomings. The proposed scheme has a simple structure due to the use of 1D convolutional layers and incorporates residual connections that significantly enhance the model's generalization. Additionally, the proposed scheme is robust against noisy conditions by incorporating a denoising U-Net model. Furthermore, the model is sufficiently fast using a sliding window time series of 10 milliseconds for detection. Utilizing positive/negative/zero sequence components of voltages, superimposed waveforms, and the rate of change of frequency provides the necessary features to precisely detect the islanding condition. In order to assess the effectiveness of the suggested scheme, over 3k islanding/non-islanding cases were tested, considering different load active/reactive powers values, load switching transients, capacitor bank switching, fault conditions in the main grid, different load quality factors, signal-to-noise ratio levels, and both types of conventional and inverter-based sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting via Manifold Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13792v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have consistently achieved remarkable results in various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, despite ongoing research efforts to better understand these models, the field still lacks a comprehensive understanding. This is particularly true for deep time series forecasting methods, where analysis and understanding work is relatively limited. Time series data, unlike image and text information, can be more challenging to interpret and analyze. To address this, we approach the problem from a manifold learning perspective, assuming that the latent representations of time series forecasting models lie next to a low-dimensional manifold. In our study, we focus on analyzing the geometric features of these latent data manifolds, including intrinsic dimension and principal curvatures. Our findings reveal that deep transformer models exhibit similar geometric behavior across layers, and these geometric features are correlated with model performance. Additionally, we observe that untrained models initially have different structures, but they rapidly converge during training. By leveraging our geometric analysis and differentiable tools, we can potentially design new and improved deep forecasting neural networks. This approach complements existing analysis studies and contributes to a better understanding of transformer models in the context of time series forecasting.

| **[Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13763v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Subsequence Approach to Topological Data Analysis for Irregularly-Spaced Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13723v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time-delay embedding (TDE), grounded in the framework of Takens's Theorem, provides a mechanism to represent and analyze the inherent dynamics of time-series data. Recently, topological data analysis (TDA) methods have been applied to study this time series representation mainly through the lens of persistent homology. Current literature on the fusion of TDE and TDA are adept at analyzing uniformly-spaced time series observations. This work introduces a novel {\em subsequence} embedding method for irregularly-spaced time-series data. We show that this method preserves the original state space topology while reducing spurious homological features. Theoretical stability results and convergence properties of the proposed method in the presence of noise and varying levels of irregularity in the spacing of the time series are established. Numerical studies and an application to real data illustrates the performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[RECOVAR: Representation Covariances on Deep Latent Spaces for Seismic Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18402v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern deep learning methods have shown great promise in the problem of earthquake detection, the most successful methods so far have been based on supervised learning, which requires large datasets with ground-truth labels. The curation of such datasets is both time consuming and prone to systematic biases, which result in difficulties with cross-dataset generalization, hindering general applicability. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised method for earthquake detection that learns to detect earthquakes from raw waveforms, without access to ground truth labels. The performance is comparable to, and in some cases better than, some state-of-the-art supervised methods. Moreover, the method has strong \emph{cross-dataset generalization} performance. The algorithm utilizes deep autoencoders that learn to reproduce the waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck and uses a simple, cross-covariance-based triggering algorithm at the bottleneck for labeling. The approach has the potential to be useful for time series datasets from other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive deep learning framework for forecasting the decadal world economic outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10874v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The gross domestic product (GDP) is the most widely used indicator in macroeconomics and the main tool for measuring a country's economic output. Due to the diversity and complexity of the world economy, a wide range of models have been used, but there are challenges in making decadal GDP forecasts given unexpected changes such as emergence of catastrophic world events including pandemics and wars. Deep learning models are well suited for modelling temporal sequences and time series forecasting. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to forecast the GDP growth rate of the world economy over a decade. We use the Penn World Table as the data source featuring 13 countries prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Australia, China, India, and the United States. We present a recursive deep learning framework to predict the GDP growth rate in the next ten years. We test prominent deep learning models and compare their results with traditional econometric models for selected developed and developing countries. Our decadal forecasts reveal that that most of the developed countries would experience economic growth slowdown, stagnation and even recession within five years (2020-2024). Furthermore, our model forecasts show that only China, France, and India would experience stable GDP growth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical testing on generative AI anomaly detection tools in Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13363v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's Disease is challenging to diagnose due to our limited understanding of its mechanism and large heterogeneity among patients. Neurodegeneration is studied widely as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis, which can be measured from time series MRI progression. On the other hand, generative AI has shown promise in anomaly detection in medical imaging and used for tasks including tumor detection. However, testing the reliability of such data-driven methods is non-trivial due to the issue of double-dipping in hypothesis testing. In this work, we propose to solve this issue with selective inference and develop a reliable generative AI method for Alzheimer's prediction. We show that compared to traditional statistical methods with highly inflated p-values, selective inference successfully controls the false discovery rate under the desired alpha level while retaining statistical power. In practice, our pipeline could assist clinicians in Alzheimer's diagnosis and early intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffImp: Efficient Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation with Bidirectional Mamba Backbone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability to estimate uncertainty of imputation results. Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding.

We propose a novel MCMC algorithm that filters the time series into distinct long-memory and ARMA components, and benchmarked it against standard approaches. Additionally, a new ABC method is proposed, using three different summary statistics used for posterior estimation. The methods are implemented and evaluated through an extensive simulation study, as well as applied to a real-world financial dataset, specifically the quarterly U.S. Gross National Product (GNP) series. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian methods in estimating long-memory and short-memory parameters, with the filtered MCMC showing superior performance in various metrics. This study enhances our understanding of Bayesian techniques in ARFIMA modeling, providing insights into their advantages and limitations when applied to complex time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data by decomposing it into trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and higlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting. We hope our work can bring a new perspective for time series forecasting. We intend to make our code publicly available as open-source in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |

However, we often observe inconsistent or seemingly contradictory performance findings across different studies. This hinders our understanding of the merits of different approaches and slows down progress. We address the need for means of assessing MTS forecasting proposals reliably and fairly, in turn enabling better exploitation of MTS as seen in different applications. Specifically, we first propose BasicTS+, a benchmark designed to enable fair, comprehensive, and reproducible comparison of MTS forecasting solutions. BasicTS+ establishes a unified training pipeline and reasonable settings, enabling an unbiased evaluation. Second, we identify the heterogeneity across different MTS as an important consideration and enable classification of MTS based on their temporal and spatial characteristics. Disregarding this heterogeneity is a prime reason for difficulties in selecting the most promising technical directions. Third, we apply BasicTS+ along with rich datasets to assess the capabilities of more than 45 MTS forecasting solutions. This provides readers with an overall picture of the cutting-edge research on MTS forecasting.

| **[Online conformal inference for multi-step time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13115v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of constructing distribution-free prediction intervals for multi-step time series forecasting, with a focus on the temporal dependencies inherent in multi-step forecast errors. We establish that the optimal $h$-step-ahead forecast errors exhibit serial correlation up to lag $(h-1)$ under a general non-stationary autoregressive data generating process. To leverage these properties, we propose the Autocorrelated Multi-step Conformal Prediction (AcMCP) method, which effectively incorporates autocorrelations in multi-step forecast errors, resulting in more statistically efficient prediction intervals. This method ensures theoretical long-run coverage guarantees for multi-step prediction intervals, though we note that increased forecasting horizons may exacerbate deviations from the target coverage, particularly in the context of limited sample sizes. Additionally, we extend several easy-to-implement conformal prediction methods, originally designed for single-step forecasting, to accommodate multi-step scenarios. Through empirical evaluations, including simulations and applications to data, we demonstrate that AcMCP achieves coverage that closely aligns with the target within local windows, while providing adaptive prediction intervals that effectively respond to varying conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Representations and Interventions in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12915v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) promise to be powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSET: Swapping-Sliding Explanation for Time Series Classifiers in Affect Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12996v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local explanation of machine learning (ML) models has recently received significant attention due to its ability to reduce ambiguities about why the models make specific decisions. Extensive efforts have been invested to address explainability for different data types, particularly images. However, the work on multivariate time series data is limited. A possible reason is that the conflation of time and other variables in time series data can cause the generated explanations to be incomprehensible to humans. In addition, some efforts on time series fall short of providing accurate explanations as they either ignore a context in the time domain or impose differentiability requirements on the ML models. Such restrictions impede their ability to provide valid explanations in real-world applications and non-differentiable ML settings. In this paper, we propose a swapping--sliding decision explanation for multivariate time series classifiers, called SSET. The proposal consists of swapping and sliding stages, by which salient sub-sequences causing significant drops in the prediction score are presented as explanations. In the former stage, the important variables are detected by swapping the series of interest with close train data from target classes. In the latter stage, the salient observations of these variables are explored by sliding a window over each time step. Additionally, the model measures the importance of different variables over time in a novel way characterized by multiple factors. We leverage SSET on affect detection domain where evaluations are performed on two real-world physiological time series datasets, WESAD and MAHNOB-HCI, and a deep convolutional classifier, CN-Waterfall. This classifier has shown superior performance to prior models to detect human affective states. Comparing SSET with several benchmarks, including LIME, integrated gradients, and Dynamask, we found..</p></details> |  |

In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints (~100) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 10% and 42%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p></details> |  |

Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying edge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging. This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series information in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to use for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.</p></details> |  |

Recent self-supervised learning methods excel in learning rich representations without labels but struggle with disentangled embeddings and inductive bias issues like transformation-invariance. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeDRL, a framework for multivariate time-series representation learning with dual-level disentangled embeddings. TimeDRL features: (i) disentangled timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for representation learning; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases. Experiments on forecasting and classification datasets show TimeDRL outperforms existing methods, with further validation in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop: Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice</p></details> |

Existing approaches used by practitioners are often ad-hoc and lack the abstractions needed to scale this process. We present TorchQL, a programming framework to evaluate and improve the correctness of machine learning applications. TorchQL allows users to write queries to specify and check integrity constraints over machine learning models and datasets. It seamlessly integrates relational algebra with functional programming to allow for highly expressive queries using only eight intuitive operators. We evaluate TorchQL on diverse use-cases including finding critical temporal inconsistencies in objects detected across video frames in autonomous driving, finding data imputation errors in time-series medical records, finding data labeling errors in real-world images, and evaluating biases and constraining outputs of language models. Our experiments show that TorchQL enables up to 13x faster query executions than baselines like Pandas and MongoDB, and up to 40% shorter queries than native Python. We also conduct a user study and find that TorchQL is natural enough for developers familiar with Python to specify complex integrity constraints.</p></details> |  |

Decomposition Delivers Both in Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11929v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, characterized by extensive input sequences, as opposed to the shorter spans typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently offer richer information for enhanced predictive precision, prevailing studies often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive parameter scales. Our study demonstrates, through both analytical and empirical evidence, that decomposition is key to containing excessive model inflation while achieving uniformly superior and robust results across various datasets. Remarkably, by tailoring decomposition to the intrinsic dynamics of time series data, our proposed model outperforms existing benchmarks, using over 99 \% fewer parameters than the majority of competing methods. Through this work, we aim to unleash the power of a restricted set of parameters by capitalizing on domain characteristics--a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.</p></details> |  |

However, when estimating power spectral densities from a finite sample each can be subject to non-ignorable bias. Astfalck et al. (2024) developed a method that offers significant bias reduction for finite samples for Welch's estimator, which this article extends to the larger family of quadratic estimators, thus offering similar theory for bias correction of lag-window and multitaper estimators as well as combinations thereof. Importantly, this theory may be used in conjunction with any and all tapers and lag-sequences designed for bias reduction, and so should be seen as an extension to valuable work in these fields, rather than a supplanting methodology. The order of computation is larger than O(n log n) typical in spectral analyses, but not insurmountable in practice. Simulation studies support the theory with comparisons across variations of quadratic estimators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Biometrika, Miscelanea</p></details> |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisited Large Language Model for Time Series Analysis through Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12326v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive performance in many pivotal web applications such as sensor data analysis. However, since LLMs are not designed for time series tasks, simpler models like linear regressions can often achieve comparable performance with far less complexity. In this study, we perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs to key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler baseline models, such as single-layer linear models and randomly initialized LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time series tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In contrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer parameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show, through data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align time series data with language and display pseudo-alignment behaviour in embedding space. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLM-based methods in time series tasks arises from the intrinsic characteristics and structure of time series data, rather than any meaningful alignment with the language model architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Leitmotifs in Multidimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12293v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A leitmotif is a recurring theme in literature, movies or music that carries symbolic significance for the piece it is contained in. When this piece can be represented as a multi-dimensional time series (MDTS), such as acoustic or visual observations, finding a leitmotif is equivalent to the pattern discovery problem, which is an unsupervised and complex problem in time series analytics. Compared to the univariate case, it carries additional complexity because patterns typically do not occur in all dimensions but only in a few - which are, however, unknown and must be detected by the method itself. In this paper, we present the novel, efficient and highly effective leitmotif discovery algorithm LAMA for MDTS. LAMA rests on two core principals: (a) a leitmotif manifests solely given a yet unknown number of sub-dimensions - neither too few, nor too many, and (b) the set of sub-dimensions are not independent from the best pattern found therein, necessitating both problems to be approached in a joint manner. In contrast to most previous methods, LAMA tackles both problems jointly - instead of independently selecting dimensions (or leitmotifs) and finding the best leitmotifs (or dimensions). Our experimental evaluation on a novel ground-truth annotated benchmark of 14 distinct real-life data sets shows that LAMA, when compared to four state-of-the-art baselines, shows superior performance in detecting meaningful patterns without increased computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning nomral patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising resutls, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |

Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abnormality Forecasting: Time Series Anomaly Prediction via Future Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12206v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying anomalies from time series data plays an important role in various fields such as infrastructure security, intelligent operation and maintenance, and space exploration. Current research focuses on detecting the anomalies after they occur, which can lead to significant financial/reputation loss or infrastructure damage. In this work we instead study a more practical yet very challenging problem, time series anomaly prediction, aiming at providing early warnings for abnormal events before their occurrence. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel principled approach, namely future context modeling (FCM). Its key insight is that the future abnormal events in a target window can be accurately predicted if their preceding observation window exhibits any subtle difference to normal data. To effectively capture such differences, FCM first leverages long-term forecasting models to generate a discriminative future context based on the observation data, aiming to amplify those subtle but unusual difference. It then models a normality correlation of the observation data with the forecasting future context to complement the normality modeling of the observation data in foreseeing possible abnormality in the target window. A joint variate-time attention learning is also introduced in FCM to leverage both temporal signals and features of the time series data for more discriminative normality modeling in the aforementioned two views. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that FCM gains good recall rate (70\%+) on multiple datasets and significantly outperforms all baselines in F1 score. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/FCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, submitted to KDD conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other processing techniques. Finally, we present two novel schemes for transposing matrices in this paper. They use similar encoding rules but with deliberate choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection. The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.</p></details> | 12 pages, 53 figures |

Traditional time series approaches for prediction often focus on either autoregressive modeling, which relies solely on past observations of the target ``endogenous variables'', or forward modeling, which considers only current covariate drivers ``exogenous variables''. However, effectively integrating past endogenous and past exogenous with current exogenous variables remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ExoTST, a novel transformer-based framework that effectively incorporates current exogenous variables alongside past context for improved time series prediction. To integrate exogenous information efficiently, ExoTST leverages the strengths of attention mechanisms and introduces a novel cross-temporal modality fusion module. This module enables the model to jointly learn from both past and current exogenous series, treating them as distinct modalities. By considering these series separately, ExoTST provides robustness and flexibility in handling data uncertainties that arise from the inherent distribution shift between historical and current exogenous variables. Extensive experiments on real-world carbon flux datasets and time series benchmarks demonstrate ExoTST's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 10\% in prediction accuracy. Moreover, ExoTST exhibits strong robustness against missing values and noise in exogenous drivers, maintaining consistent performance in real-world situations where these imperfections are common.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |

In designing efficient pension systems, government policymakers seek to satisfy the expectations of the overall aging population in Australia. However, the population's unique demographic characteristics at the state and territory level are often overlooked due to the lack of available data. We use the Hamilton-Perry model, which requires minimum input, to model and forecast the evolution of age-specific populations at the state level. We also integrate the obtained sub-national demographic information to determine sustainable pension ages up to 2051. We also investigate pension welfare distribution in all states and territories to identify disadvantaged residents under the current pension system. Using the sub-national mortality data for Australia from 1971 to 2021 obtained from AHMD (2023), we implement the Hamilton-Perry model with the help of functional time series forecasting techniques. With forecasts of age-specific population sizes for each state and territory, we compute the old age dependency ratio to determine the nationwide sustainable pension age.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Our reasonings make a repeated use of dualities between so called times and so called counts that generalize the duality of the recurrence time and the longest match length.

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design.

| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to explore the application of a time-series foundation model for VaR estimation. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that, in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings. Overall, foundation models can provide completely alternative approaches to traditional econometric methods, yet there are challenges to be tackled.</p></details> |  |

This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons.

Its performance is compared with methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IForest) and GNN-based method for bearing fault detection (GNNBFD). Findings: The model achieved outstanding results, with precision, recall, and F1-scores reaching 100\% across various testing conditions. It not only identifies faults accurately but also generalizes effectively across different operational scenarios, outperforming traditional methods. Originality: This research presents a unique combination of GAT and LSTM for fault detection, overcoming the limitations of traditional time series methods by capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Its superior performance demonstrates significant potential for predictive maintenance in industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Learning with Foundational Models for Time Series Forecasting using Low-Rank Adaptations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11539v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High computational power and the availability of large datasets have supported the development of Foundational Models. They are a new emerging technique widely used in Generative Artificial Intelligence, characterized by their scalability and their use in Transfer Learning. The enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training phase, known as pre-training, give them a higher generalization capacity than any other specific model, constituting a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes LLIAM, the Llama Lora-Integrated Autorregresive Model. Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. To illustrate the capabilities of our proposal, two sets of experiments have been carried out that obtained favorable and promising results with lower training times than other Deep Learning approaches. With this work, we also encourage the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional Artificial Intelligence and those specified by the definition of Green Artificial Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Neural ODEs: nonlinear model order reduction and Koopman operator approximations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10174v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful framework for learning compact latent representations, while NeuralODEs excel in learning transient system dynamics. This work combines the strengths of both to create fast surrogate models with adjustable complexity. By leveraging the VAE's dimensionality reduction using a non-hierarchical prior, our method adaptively assigns stochastic noise, naturally complementing known NeuralODE training enhancements and enabling probabilistic time series modeling. We show that standard Latent ODEs struggle with dimensionality reduction in systems with time-varying inputs. Our approach mitigates this by continuously propagating variational parameters through time, establishing fixed information channels in latent space. This results in a flexible and robust method that can learn different system complexities, e.g. deep neural networks or linear matrices. Hereby, it enables efficient approximation of the Koopman operator without the need for predefining its dimensionality. As our method balances dimensionality reduction and reconstruction accuracy, we call it Balanced Neural ODE (B-NODE). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on academic test cases and apply it to a real-world example of a thermal power plant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper under review</p></details> |
| **[TADA: Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15174v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization aim to train models to effectively perform on samples that are unseen and outside of the distribution. Adversarial data augmentation (ADA) is a widely used technique in domain generalization. It enhances the model robustness by including synthetic samples designed to simulate potential unseen scenarios into the training datasets, which is then used to train the model. However, in time series data, traditional ADA approaches often fail to address distribution shifts related to temporal characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation (TADA) for time series data, which incorporate time warping into ADA. Although time warping is inherently non-differentiable, ADA relies on generating samples through backpropagation. We resolve this issue by leveraging the duality between phase shifts in the frequency domain and time shifts in the time domain, thereby making the process differentiable. Our evaluations across various time series datasets demonstrate that TADA outperforms existing methods for domain generalization. In addition, using distribution visualization, we confirmed that the distribution shifts induced by TADA are clearly different from those induced by ADA, and together, they effectively simulate real-world distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |

The research examines the proportion of female students, first-year enrollments, and degrees awarded to women in the field. The issue of low female participation in Informatics has long been recognized as a persistent challenge and remains a critical area of scholarly inquiry. Furthermore, existing literature indicates that socio-economic factors can unpredictably influence female participation, complicating efforts to address the gender gap. The analysis focuses on participation data from research universities at various academic levels, including Bachelors, Masters, and PhD programs, and seeks to uncover potential correlations between female participation and geographical or economic zones. The dataset was first enriched by integrating additional information, such as each country's GDP and relevant geographical data, sourced from various online repositories. Subsequently, the data was cleaned to ensure consistency and eliminate incomplete time series. A final set of complete time series was selected for further analysis. We then used the data collected from the internet to assign countries to different clusters. Specifically, we employed Economic Zone, Geographical Area, and GDP quartile to cluster countries and compare their temporal trends both within and between clusters. We analyze the results for each classification and derive conclusions based on the available data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Role of Delay in Brain Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11384v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant variations of delays among connecting neurons cause an inevitable disadvantage of asynchronous brain dynamics compared to synchronous deep learning. However, this study demonstrates that this disadvantage can be converted into a computational advantage using a network with a single output and M multiple delays between successive layers, thereby generating a polynomial time-series outputs with M. The proposed role of delay in brain dynamics (RoDiB) model, is capable of learning increasing number of classified labels using a fixed architecture, and overcomes the inflexibility of the brain to update the learning architecture using additional neurons and connections. Moreover, the achievable accuracies of the RoDiB system are comparable with those of its counterpart tunable single delay architectures with M outputs. Further, the accuracies are significantly enhanced when the number of output labels exceeds its fully connected input size. The results are mainly obtained using simulations of VGG-6 on CIFAR datasets and also include multiple label inputs. However, currently only a small fraction of the abundant number of RoDiB outputs is utilized, thereby suggesting its potential for advanced computational power yet to be discovered.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Given the importance of stress monitoring for mental health, developing a highly reliable and accurate affective computing model is essential. In this context, we propose a novel model, for affective state prediction using physiological signals. PhysioFormer model integrates individual attributes and multimodal physiological data to address interindividual variability, enhancing its reliability and generalization across different individuals. By incorporating feature embedding and affective representation modules, PhysioFormer model captures dynamic changes in time-series data and multimodal signal features, significantly improving accuracy. The model also includes an explainability model that uses symbolic regression to extract laws linking physiological signals to affective states, increasing transparency and explainability. Experiments conducted on the Wrist and Chest subsets of the WESAD dataset confirmed the model's superior performance, achieving over 99% accuracy, outperforming existing SOTA models. Sensitivity and ablation experiments further demonstrated PhysioFormer's reliability, validating the contribution of its individual components. The integration of symbolic regression not only enhanced model explainability but also highlighted the complex relationships between physiological signals and affective states. Future work will focus on optimizing the model for larger datasets and real-time applications, particularly in more complex environments. Additionally, further exploration of physiological signals and environmental factors will help build a more comprehensive affective computing system, advancing its use in health monitoring and psychological intervention.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[Regularized Estimation of High-Dimensional Matrix-Variate Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11320v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-variate time series data are increasingly popular in economics, statistics, and environmental studies, among other fields. This paper develops regularized estimation methods for analyzing high-dimensional matrix-variate time series using bilinear matrix-variate autoregressive models. The bilinear autoregressive structure is widely used for matrix-variate time series, as it reduces model complexity while capturing interactions between rows and columns. However, when dealing with large dimensions, the commonly used iterated least-squares method results in numerous estimated parameters, making interpretation difficult. To address this, we propose two regularized estimation methods to further reduce model dimensionality. The first assumes banded autoregressive coefficient matrices, where each data point interacts only with nearby points. A two-step estimation method is used: first, traditional iterated least-squares is applied for initial estimates, followed by a banded iterated least-squares approach. A Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is introduced to estimate the bandwidth of the coefficient matrices. The second method assumes sparse autoregressive matrices, applying the LASSO technique for regularization. We derive asymptotic properties for both methods as the dimensions diverge and the sample size $T\rightarrow\infty$. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, comparing their forecasting performance against common autoregressive models in the literature.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of explicitly modeling this periodicity to enhance the performance of models in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) technique, which utilizes learnable recurrent cycles to model the inherent periodic patterns within sequences, and then performs predictions on the residual components of the modeled cycles. Combining RCF with a Linear layer or a shallow MLP forms the simple yet powerful method proposed in this paper, called CycleNet. CycleNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in multiple domains including electricity, weather, and energy, while offering significant efficiency advantages by reducing over 90% of the required parameter quantity. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play technique, the RCF can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy of existing models, including PatchTST and iTransformer.

A formula to calculate the labels was developed, and the various models were applied to user data. Time Series Transformer was used for labels where time series characteristics are crucial, while Machine Learning Ensembles were employed for labels requiring comprehensive daily activity statistics. Time Series Transformer excels in capturing the characteristics of time series through pre-training, while Machine Learning Ensembles select machine learning models that meet our categorization criteria. The proposed model, TraM, scored 6.10 out of 10 in experiments, demonstrating superior performance compared to other methodologies.

State-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on Transformer architectures, which utilize attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods are hindered by quadratic time complexity, limiting the model's scalability with respect to input sequence length. This significantly restricts their practicality in the real world. Mamba, based on state space models (SSM), provides a solution with linear time complexity, increasing the potential for efficient forecasting of sequential data. In this study, we propose UmambaTSF, a novel long-term time series forecasting framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of U-shaped encoder-decoder multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with Mamba's long sequence representation. To improve performance and efficiency, the Mamba blocks introduced in the framework adopt a refined residual structure and adaptable design, enabling the capture of unique temporal signals and flexible channel processing. In the experiments, UmambaTSF achieves state-of-the-art performance and excellent generality on widely used benchmark datasets while maintaining linear time complexity and low memory consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Understand Time Series Anomalies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05440v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: 1. LLMs understand time series better as images rather than as text 2. LLMs did not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in explicit reasoning about time series analysis 3. Contrary to common beliefs, LLM's understanding of time series do not stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities 4. LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis vary significantly across different model architectures This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand time series anomalies, many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold. Our code and data are available at `https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/AnomLLM/`.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Properties of Deep Neural Networks with Dependent Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11113v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes statistical properties of deep neural network (DNN) estimators under dependent data. Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNNs estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. These results are then used to demonstrate how asymptotic inference can be conducted on the finite dimensional parameter of a partially linear regression model after first-stage DNN estimation of infinite dimensional parameters. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</p></details> | 102 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Identifying sparse treatment effects in high-dimensional outcome spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14644v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on technological advances in sensing modalities, randomized trials with primary outcomes represented as high-dimensional vectors have become increasingly prevalent. For example, these outcomes could be week-long time-series data from wearable devices or high-dimensional neuroimaging data, such as from functional magnetic resonance imaging. This paper focuses on randomized treatment studies with such high-dimensional outcomes characterized by sparse treatment effects, where interventions may influence a small number of dimensions, e.g., small temporal windows or specific brain regions. Conventional practices, such as using fixed, low-dimensional summaries of the outcomes, result in significantly reduced power for detecting treatment effects. To address this limitation, we propose a procedure that involves subset selection followed by inference. Specifically, given a potentially large set of outcome summaries, we identify the subset that captures treatment effects, which requires only one call to the Lasso, and subsequently conduct inference on the selected subset. Via theoretical analysis as well as simulations, we demonstrate that our method asymptotically selects the correct subset and increases statistical power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Viewmakers for Robust Disruption Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11065v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning guided data augmentation may support the development of technologies in the physical sciences, such as nuclear fusion tokamaks. Here we endeavor to study the problem of detecting disruptions i.e. plasma instabilities that can cause significant damages, impairing the reliability and efficiency required for their real world viability. Machine learning (ML) prediction models have shown promise in detecting disruptions for specific tokamaks, but they often struggle in generalizing to the diverse characteristics and dynamics of different machines. This limits the effectiveness of ML models across different tokamak designs and operating conditions, which is a critical barrier to scaling fusion technology. Given the success of data augmentation in improving model robustness and generalizability in other fields, this study explores the use of a novel time series viewmaker network to generate diverse augmentations or "views" of training data. Our results show that incorporating views during training improves AUC and F2 scores on DisruptionBench tasks compared to standard or no augmentations. This approach represents a promising step towards developing more broadly applicable ML models for disruption avoidance, which is essential for advancing fusion technology and, ultimately, addressing climate change through reliable and sustainable energy production.</p></details> |  |

The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that extract dynamic and stochastic information from finite time-series data of complex systems. In this study, we introduce a new variant of LIM, called Colored-LIM, which models stochasticity using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise. Despite the non-trivial correlation between observable and colored noise, we show that Colored-LIM unveils the desired information merely from the correlation function of the observable. Therefore, this approach not only accounts for the memory effects of environmental noise, traditionally represented by time-uncorrelated white noise in the Classical LIM framework, but does so using the same observation dataset without requiring additional data. Furthermore, we show that Colored-LIM does not reduce to Classical LIM in the white noise limit, underscoring the importance of temporal dependencies in stochastic systems. In this paper, we rigorously develop the Colored-LIM, explore its connections with the Classical LIM and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, and validate its effectiveness on both ideal linear and nonlinear systems. In addition, we illustrate the potential applications and implications of Colored-LIM for real-world problems, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation and the electricity network of Tohoku University.</p></details> | 16 pages |

The approach employs a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict the monthly accumulations of daily detected active fire spots. Data analysis revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through machine learning techniques. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to both the test and validation sets for both seeds. The results indicate that the combined LSTM and GRU model delivers excellent forecasting performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in forecasting active fire spots. The proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new opportunities for research and development in machine learning and prediction of natural phenomena.

| **[Anomaly Detection based on Markov Data: A Statistical Depth Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16759v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main purpose of this article to extend the notion of statistical depth to the case of sample paths of a Markov chain. Initially introduced to define a center-outward ordering of points in the support of a multivariate distribution, depth functions permit to generalize the notions of quantiles and (signed) ranks for observations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d>1$, as well as statistical procedures based on such quantities. In this paper, overcoming the lack of natural order on the torus composed of all possible trajectories of finite length, we develop a general theoretical framework for evaluating the depth of a Markov sample path and recovering it statistically from an estimate of its transition probability with (non-) asymptotic guarantees. We also detail some of its numerous applications, focusing particularly on anomaly detection, a key task in various fields involving the analysis of (supposedly) Markov time-series (\textit{e.g.} health monitoring of complex infrastructures, security). Beyond the description of the methodology promoted and the statistical analysis carried out to guarantee its validity, numerical experiments are displayed, providing strong empirical evidence of the relevance of the novel concept we introduce here to quantify the degree of abnormality of Markov path sequences of variable length.</p></details> |  |

Despite the strong reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs, leveraging them for sensor data tasks remains largely unexplored. This gap stems from challenges like the lack of semantic context in time-series data, computational limitations, and LLMs' difficulty processing numerical inputs. To address these issues, we introduce SensorLLM, a two-stage framework to unlock LLMs' potential for sensor data tasks. In the Sensor-Language Alignment Stage, we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate trend-descriptive text to align sensor data with textual inputs, enabling SensorLLM to capture numerical changes, channel-specific information, and sensor data of varying lengths-capabilities that existing LLMs typically struggle with, all without the need for human annotations. Next, in Task-Aware Tuning Stage, we refine the model for HAR classification using the frozen LLM and alignment module, achieving performance on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art models. We further demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, enabling it to generalize across diverse datasets for HAR tasks. We strongly believe our work lays the stepstone for future time-series and text alignment research, offering a path toward foundation models for sensor data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent Networks for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10535v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent models, which are machine learning models that produce inherently interpretable predictions, are receiving significant attention in high-stakes domains. However, despite much real-world data being collected as time series, there is a lack of studies on transparent time series models. To address this gap, we propose a novel transparent neural network model for time series called Generalized Additive Time Series Model (GATSM). GATSM consists of two parts: 1) independent feature networks to learn feature representations, and 2) a transparent temporal module to learn temporal patterns across different time steps using the feature representations. This structure allows GATSM to effectively capture temporal patterns and handle dynamic-length time series while preserving transparency. Empirical experiments show that GATSM significantly outperforms existing generalized additive models and achieves comparable performance to black-box time series models, such as recurrent neural networks and Transformer. In addition, we demonstrate that GATSM finds interesting patterns in time series. The source code is available at https://github.com/gim4855744/GATSM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10530v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations -- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation.

To that end, we formally define causal interventions and their effects over time on discrete-time stochastic processes (DSPs). Then, we show under which conditions the equilibrium states of a DSP, both before and after a causal intervention, can be captured by a structural causal model (SCM). With such an equivalence at hand, we provide an explicit mapping from vector autoregressive models (VARs), broadly applied in econometrics, to linear, but potentially cyclic and/or affected by unmeasured confounders, SCMs. The resulting causal VAR framework allows us to perform causal inference over time from observational time series data. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves strong performance in terms of observational forecasting while enabling accurate estimation of the causal effect of interventions on dynamical systems. We demonstrate, through a case study, the potential practical questions that can be addressed using the proposed causal VAR framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moirai-MoE: Empowering Time Series Foundation Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10469v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance as zero-shot forecasters. However, achieving effectively unified training on time series remains an open challenge. Existing approaches introduce some level of model specialization to account for the highly heterogeneous nature of time series data. For instance, Moirai pursues unified training by employing multiple input/output projection layers, each tailored to handle time series at a specific frequency. Similarly, TimesFM maintains a frequency embedding dictionary for this purpose. We identify two major drawbacks to this human-imposed frequency-level model specialization: (1) Frequency is not a reliable indicator of the underlying patterns in time series. For example, time series with different frequencies can display similar patterns, while those with the same frequency may exhibit varied patterns. (2) Non-stationarity is an inherent property of real-world time series, leading to varied distributions even within a short context window of a single time series. Frequency-level specialization is too coarse-grained to capture this level of diversity. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Moirai-MoE, using a single input/output projection layer while delegating the modeling of diverse time series patterns to the sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers. With these designs, Moirai-MoE reduces reliance on human-defined heuristics and enables automatic token-level specialization. Extensive experiments on 39 datasets demonstrate the superiority of Moirai-MoE over existing foundation models in both in-distribution and zero-shot scenarios. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive model analyses to explore the inner workings of time series MoE foundation models and provides valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, the advancement of these models has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation, GIFT-Eval, a pioneering benchmark aimed at promoting evaluation across diverse datasets. GIFT-Eval encompasses 28 datasets over 144,000 time series and 177 million data points, spanning seven domains, 10 frequencies, multivariate inputs, and prediction lengths ranging from short to long-term forecasts. To facilitate the effective pretraining and evaluation of foundation models, we also provide a non-leaking pretraining dataset containing approximately 230 billion data points. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of 17 baselines, which includes statistical models, deep learning models, and foundation models. We discuss each model in the context of various benchmark characteristics and offer a qualitative analysis that spans both deep learning and foundation models. We believe the insights from this analysis, along with access to this new standard zero-shot time series forecasting benchmark, will guide future developments in time series foundation models. The codebase, datasets, and a leaderboard showing all the results in detail will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional applications of decision trees that forecast time series directly, Hyper-Trees are designed to learn the parameters of time series models. Our framework combines the effectiveness of gradient boosted trees on tabular data with the advantages of established time series models, thereby naturally inducing a time series inductive bias to tree models. By relating the parameters of a target time series model to features, Hyper-Trees also address the issue of parameter non-stationarity. To resolve the inherent scaling issue of boosted trees when estimating a large number of target model parameters, we combine decision trees and neural networks within a unified framework. In this novel approach, the trees first generate informative representations from the input features, which a shallow network then maps to the target model parameters. With our research, we aim to explore the effectiveness of Hyper-Trees across various forecasting scenarios and to extend the application of gradient boosted trees outside their conventional use in time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forec...</summary><p>Forecasting, Gradient Boosting Machines, Hyper-Networks, Parameter Non-Stationarity, Time Series</p></details> |

This research transforms these time-series current signals into time-frequency 2D representations via Wavelet Transform (WT). The dataset for motor current signals includes 3,750 data points across five categories: one representing normal conditions and four representing artificially induced faults, each under five different load conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The study employs five WT-based techniques: WT-Amor, WT-Bump, WT-Morse, WSST-Amor, and WSST-Bump. Subsequently, five DL models adopting prior Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture were developed and tested using the transformed 2D plots from each method. The DL models for WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and WT-Morse showed remarkable effectiveness with peak model accuracy of 90.93, 89.20, and 93.73%, respectively, surpassing previous 2D-image-based methods that recorded accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80% respectively using the identical dataset and validation protocol. Notably, the WT-Morse approach slightly exceeded the formerly highest ML technique, achieving a 93.20% accuracy. However, the two WSST methods that utilized synchrosqueezing techniques faced difficulty accurately classifying motor faults. The performance of Wavelet-based deep learning methods offers a compelling alternative for machine condition monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 figures, presented at the 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |

Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 images, presented at 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |
| **[WT-CFormer: High-Performance Web Traffic Anomaly Detection Using CNN and Transformer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10327v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web traffic (WT) refers to time-series data that captures the volume of data transmitted to and from a web server during a user's visit to a website. Anomalies in web traffic signal unusual fluctuations in this data, making their detection crucial for ensuring network security. Deep neural network approaches for web traffic anomaly detection have achieved cutting-edge classification performance. However, since these methods are still insufficient in terms of classification effectiveness and speed, researching fast and accurate anomaly detection methods is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection model (WT-CFormer) specifically designed for web traffic, which innovatively use the Transformer to efficiently and accurately extract the temporal features of web traffic and deeply integrates the CNN to extract the spatial features of web traffic to improve the anomaly detection performance. In addition, we conduct a large number of experiments to prove the effectiveness and superiority of WT-CFormer for web traffic anomaly detection. In evaluation experiments, WT-CFormer has the highest performance, obtaining a recall as high as 96.79%, a precision of 97.35%, an F1 score of 97.07%, and an accuracy of 99.43%, which is 7.09%,1.15%, 4.77%, and 0.83% better than the state-of-the-art method, followed by C-LSTM, CTGA, random forest, and KNN algorithms. In addition, we find that the classification performance of WT-CFormer with only 50 training epochs outperforms C-LSTM with 500 training epochs, which greatly improves the convergence performance. Finally, we perform ablation experiments to demonstrate the necessity of each component within WT-CFormer.</p></details> |  |

| **[ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10285v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across various industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management. Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with references, 5 figures</p></details> |

The core idea is to train an encoder to transform trajectories into representation vectors and then compute vector similarity to approximate the ground truth. However, existing methods face dual challenges of effectiveness and efficiency: 1) they all utilize Euclidean distance to compute representation similarity, which leads to the severe curse of dimensionality issue -- reducing the distinguishability among representations and significantly affecting the accuracy of subsequent similarity search tasks; 2) most of them are trained in triplets manner and often necessitate additional information which downgrades the efficiency; 3) previous studies, while emphasizing the scalability in terms of efficiency, overlooked the deterioration of effectiveness when the dataset size grows. To cope with these issues, we propose a simple, yet accurate, fast, scalable model that only uses a single-layer vanilla transformer encoder as the feature extractor and employs tailored representation similarity functions to approximate various ground truth similarity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly mitigates the curse of dimensionality issue and outperforms the state-of-the-arts in effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRL Optimization Trajectory Generation via Wireless Network Intent-Guided Diffusion Models for Optimizing Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14481v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in wireless communication fields, including low-altitude economies, 6G, and Wi-Fi, the scale of wireless networks continues to expand, accompanied by increasing service quality demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Term Human Trajectory Prediction using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00552v3)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[PTR: A Pre-trained Language Model for Trajectory Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is vital for web-of-things services and is extensively collected and analyzed by web-based hardware and platforms. However, issues such as service interruptions and network instability often lead to sparsely recorded trajectories, resulting in a loss of detailed movement data. As a result, recovering these trajectories to restore missing information becomes essential. Despite progress, several challenges remain unresolved. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data hampers the performance of existing deep learning methods, which rely heavily on abundant data for supervised training. Second, current methods struggle to generalize across sparse trajectories with varying sampling intervals, necessitating separate re-training for each interval and increasing computational costs. Third, external factors crucial for the recovery of missing points are not fully incorporated. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called PTR. This framework mitigates the issue of limited dense trajectory data by leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). PTR incorporates an explicit trajectory prompt and is trained on datasets with multiple sampling intervals, enabling it to generalize effectively across different intervals in sparse trajectories. To capture external factors, we introduce an implicit trajectory prompt that models road conditions, providing richer information for recovering missing points. Additionally, we present a trajectory embedder that encodes trajectory points and transforms the embeddings of both observed and missing points into a format comprehensible to PLMs. Experimental results on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of PTR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on trajectories from a single spatial view, limiting their ability to capture the rich contextual information that is crucial for gaining deeper insights into movement patterns across different geospatial contexts. To this end, we propose MVTraj, a novel multi-view modeling method for trajectory representation learning. MVTraj integrates diverse contextual knowledge, from GPS to road network and points-of-interest to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory data. To align the learning process across multiple views, we utilize GPS trajectories as a bridge and employ self-supervised pretext tasks to capture and distinguish movement patterns across different spatial views. Following this, we treat trajectories from different views as distinct modalities and apply a hierarchical cross-modal interaction module to fuse the representations, thereby enriching the knowledge derived from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MVTraj significantly outperforms existing baselines in tasks associated with various spatial views, validating its effectiveness and practical utility in spatio-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Current air traffic control systems fail to consider spoken instructions for traffic prediction, bringing significant challenges in detecting human errors during real-time traffic operations. Here, we present an automation paradigm integrating controlling intent into the information processing loop through the spoken instruction-aware flight trajectory prediction framework. A 3-stage progressive multi-modal learning paradigm is proposed to address the modality gap between the trajectory and spoken instructions, as well as minimize the data requirements. Experiments on a real-world dataset show the proposed framework achieves flight trajectory prediction with high predictability and timeliness, obtaining over 20% relative reduction in mean deviation error. Moreover, the generalizability of the proposed framework is also confirmed by various model architectures. The proposed framework can formulate full-automated information processing in real-world air traffic applications, supporting human error detection and enhancing aviation safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in principle by Nature Communications</p></details> |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating Policies from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPF-EMPC Planner: A real-time multi-robot trajectory planner for complex environments with uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13573v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications, the unpredictable movement of obstacles and the imprecise state observation of robots introduce significant uncertainties for the swarm of robots, especially in cluster environments. However, existing methods are difficult to realize safe navigation, considering uncertainties, complex environmental structures, and robot swarms. This paper introduces an extended state model predictive control planner with a safe probability field to address the multi-robot navigation problem in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Initially, the safe probability field offers an innovative approach to model the uncertainty of external dynamic obstacles, combining it with an unconstrained optimization method to generate safe trajectories for multi-robot online. Subsequently, the extended state model predictive controller can accurately track these generated trajectories while considering the robots' inherent model constraints and state uncertainty, thus ensuring the practical feasibility of the planned trajectories. Simulation experiments show a success rate four times higher than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Physical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to operate in real-time, enabling safe navigation for multi-robot in uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Truncating Trajectories in Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation: an Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13463v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy evaluation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is at the core of many MC Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (e.g., policy gradient methods). In this context, the designer of the learning system specifies an interaction budget that the agent usually spends by collecting trajectories of fixed length within a simulator. However, is this data collection strategy the best option? To answer this question, in this paper, we propose as a quality index a surrogate of the mean squared error of a return estimator that uses trajectories of different lengths, i.e., \emph{truncated}. Specifically, this surrogate shows the sub-optimality of the fixed-length trajectory schedule. Furthermore, it suggests that adaptive data collection strategies that spend the available budget sequentially can allocate a larger portion of transitions in timesteps in which more accurate sampling is required to reduce the error of the final estimate. Building on these findings, we present an adaptive algorithm called Robust and Iterative Data collection strategy Optimization (RIDO). The main intuition behind RIDO is to split the available interaction budget into mini-batches. At each round, the agent determines the most convenient schedule of trajectories that minimizes an empirical and robust version of the surrogate of the estimator's error. After discussing the theoretical properties of our method, we conclude by assessing its performance across multiple domains. Our results show that RIDO can adapt its trajectory schedule toward timesteps where more sampling is required to increase the quality of the final estimation.</p></details> |  |

Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive "pseudo-bearing" measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness. To validate our approach, we derived the optimal rotation speed and conducted extensive simulations and field missions with our GyroCopter to track and localize multiple RF sources. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential as a practical and rapid solution for RF source localization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For a demonstration video, see https://youtu.be/OkmmQjD74Us</p></details> |

However, existing approaches only operate on static structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic in nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models (GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of 3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it requires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical symmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We theoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels can lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition kernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention. Furthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional generation, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the forward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in various scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate that GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly higher quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024. 29 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

After pre-processing the input GPS data, human mobility traces are modeled as multidimensional curves using Functional Data Analysis (FDA). Then, the synthesis process identifies the K-nearest trajectories and averages their Square-Root Velocity Functions (SRVFs) to generate synthetic data. This results in synthetic trajectories that maintain the utility of the original data while ensuring privacy. Although applied for human mobility research, FDASynthesis is highly adaptable to different types of functional data, offering a scalable solution in various application domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[How does Your RL Agent Explore? An Optimal Transport Analysis of Occupancy Measure Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09113v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising successes of RL are propelled by combining smart algorithmic strategies and deep architectures to optimize the distribution of returns and visitations over the state-action space. A quantitative framework to compare the learning processes of these eclectic RL algorithms is currently absent but desired in practice. We address this gap by representing the learning process of an RL algorithm as a sequence of policies generated during training, and then studying the policy trajectory induced in the manifold of state-action occupancy measures. Using an optimal transport-based metric, we measure the length of the paths induced by the policy sequence yielded by an RL algorithm between an initial policy and a final optimal policy. Hence, we first define the 'Effort of Sequential Learning' (ESL). ESL quantifies the relative distance that an RL algorithm travels compared to the shortest path from the initial to the optimal policy. Further, we connect the dynamics of policies in the occupancy measure space and regret (another metric to understand the suboptimality of an RL algorithm), by defining the 'Optimal Movement Ratio' (OMR). OMR assesses the fraction of movements in the occupancy measure space that effectively reduce an analogue of regret. Finally, we derive approximation guarantees to estimate ESL and OMR with finite number of samples and without access to an optimal policy. Through empirical analyses across various environments and algorithms, we demonstrate that ESL and OMR provide insights into the exploration processes of RL algorithms and hardness of different tasks in discrete and continuous MDPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Manifold Optimization for Fast and Adaptive Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12193v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast kinodynamic motion planning is crucial for systems to effectively adapt to dynamically changing environments. Despite some efforts, existing approaches still struggle with rapid planning in high-dimensional, complex problems. Not surprisingly, the primary challenge arises from the high-dimensionality of the search space, specifically the trajectory space. We address this issue with a two-step method: initially, we identify a lower-dimensional trajectory manifold {\it offline}, comprising diverse trajectories specifically relevant to the task at hand while meeting kinodynamic constraints. Subsequently, we search for solutions within this manifold {\it online}, significantly enhancing the planning speed. To encode and generate a manifold of continuous-time, differentiable trajectories, we propose a novel neural network model, {\it Differentiable Motion Manifold Primitives (DMMP)}, along with a practical training strategy. Experiments with a 7-DoF robot arm tasked with dynamic throwing to arbitrary target positions demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in planning speed, task success, and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an appealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively combining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current approaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed, single-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle positions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances. However, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently reconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical solution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation framework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging high-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal data sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural network models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both scene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and trajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via multimodal representations. The transformer network then generates near-optimal initial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing convergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 80% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to traditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenario variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to 2025 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.

| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contour Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Learned Reward Functions with Counterfactual Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04856v4)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning rewards from human behaviour or feedback is a promising approach to aligning AI systems with human values but fails to consistently extract correct reward functions. Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures.

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently integrating world models with decision transformers remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines the Dreamer algorithm's ability to generate anticipatory trajectories with the adaptive learning strengths of the Online Decision Transformer. Our methodology enables parallel training where Dreamer-produced trajectories enhance the contextual decision-making of the transformer, creating a bidirectional enhancement loop. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a suite of challenging benchmarks, achieving notable improvements in sample efficiency and reward maximization over existing methods. Our results indicate that the proposed integrated framework not only accelerates learning but also showcases robustness in diverse and dynamic scenarios, marking a significant step forward in model-based reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

However, many trajectory prediction models produce unreasonable trajectory samples that focus on improving diversity or accuracy while neglecting other key requirements, such as collision avoidance with the surrounding environment. In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as inpreceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Trajectory Optimization on Matrix Lie Groups via Lie-Algebraic Differential Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02018v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix Lie groups are an important class of manifolds commonly used in control and robotics, and optimizing control policies on these manifolds is a fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DragEntity: Trajectory Guided Video Generation using Entity and Positional Relationships](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10751v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of video generation, with controllable video generation receiving significant attention. However, existing control methods still face two limitations: Firstly, control conditions (such as depth maps, 3D Mesh) are difficult for ordinary users to obtain directly. Secondly, it's challenging to drive multiple objects through complex motions with multiple trajectories simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce DragEntity, a video generation model that utilizes entity representation for controlling the motion of multiple objects. Compared to previous methods, DragEntity offers two main advantages: 1) Our method is more user-friendly for interaction because it allows users to drag entities within the image rather than individual pixels. 2) We use entity representation to represent any object in the image, and multiple objects can maintain relative spatial relationships. Therefore, we allow multiple trajectories to control multiple objects in the image with different levels of complexity simultaneously. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of DragEntity, demonstrating its excellent performance in fine-grained control in video generation.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 Oral |

Prior works typically neglect to maintain uncertainty about occluded objects and only predict trajectories of observed objects using high-capacity models such as Transformers trained on large datasets. While these approaches are effective in standard scenarios, they can struggle to generalize to the long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we explore a conceptual framework unifying trajectory prediction and occlusion reasoning under the same class of structured probabilistic generative model, namely, switching dynamical systems. We then present some initial experiments illustrating its capabilities using the Waymo open dataset.</p></details> |  |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Distribution of Probe Traffic Volume Estimated without Trajectory Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15274v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, passively recorded probe traffic volumes have increasingly been used to estimate traffic volumes. However, it is not always possible to count probe traffic volume in a spatial dataset when probe trajectories cannot be fully reconstructed from raw probe point location data due to sparse recording intervals, lack of pseudonyms or timestamps. As a result, the application of such probe point location data has been limited in traffic volume estimation. To relax these constraints, we present the exact distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume in a road segment based on probe point location data without trajectory reconstruction. The distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume can exhibit multimodality, without necessarily being line-symmetric with respect to the true probe traffic volume. As more probes are present, the distribution approaches a normal distribution. The conformity of the distribution was visualised through numerical simulations. Sometimes, there exists a local optimal cordon length that maximises estimation precision. The theoretical variance of estimated probe traffic volume can address heteroscedasticity in the modelling of traffic volume estimates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Here we examine a zoo of diffusion-based inpainting methods on a specific dataset of corrupted images, which represent incomplete Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation readily reproduces the built-in correlations of fBm paths in different memory regimes (i.e., for sub-, Brownian and super-diffusion trajectories), providing a robust tool for the statistical imputation at high missing ratio. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to memorize samples from the training database, we demonstrate that diffusion behaves qualitatively different from the database search and thus generalize rather than memorize the training dataset. As a biological application, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model for the imputation of microscopy-derived distance matrices of chromosomal segments (FISH data) - incomplete due to experimental imperfections - and demonstrate its superiority over the standard approaches used in bioinformatics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation. Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and moving-body videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

Conventional stochastic trajectory prediction methods utilize latent variables to represent the multi-modality of vessel motion, however, tends to overlook the complexity and dynamics inherent in maritime behavior. In contrast, we explicitly simulate the transition of vessel motion from uncertainty towards a state of certainty, effectively handling future indeterminacy in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a novel framework (\textit{DiffuTraj}) to conceptualize the trajectory prediction task as a guided reverse process of motion pattern uncertainty diffusion, in which we progressively remove uncertainty from maritime regions to delineate the intended trajectory. Specifically, we encode the previous states of the target vessel, vessel-vessel interactions, and the environment context as guiding factors for trajectory generation. Subsequently, we devise a transformer-based conditional denoiser to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, enabling the generation of trajectories better aligned for particular maritime environment.

This paper explores the indirect method of trajectory optimization, emphasizing its application in creating optimal periodic gaits for legged systems and contrasting it with the more commonly used direct method. While the direct method provides considerable flexibility in its implementation, it is limited by its input space parameterization. In contrast, the indirect method improves accuracy by defining control inputs as functions of the system's states and costates. We tackle the convergence challenges associated with indirect shooting methods, particularly through the systematic development of gait libraries by utilizing numerical continuation methods. Our contributions include: (1) the formalization of a general periodic trajectory optimization problem that extends existing first-order necessary conditions for a broader range of cost functions and operating conditions; (2) a methodology for efficiently generating libraries of optimal trajectories (gaits) utilizing a single shooting approach combined with numerical continuation methods, including a novel approach for reconstructing Lagrange multipliers and costates from passive gaits; and (3) a comparative analysis of the indirect and direct shooting methods using a compass-gait walker as a case study, demonstrating the former's superior accuracy in generating optimal gaits. The findings underscore the potential of the indirect method for generating families of optimal gaits, thereby advancing the field of trajectory optimization in legged robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP) framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, under review</p></details> |

Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs.

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions.

A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns.

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel model for representing high dimensional spatiotemporal trajectories as sequences of discrete locations and encoding them with a Transformer-based neural network architecture. Similar to language models, our Sequence Transformer for Agent Representation Encodings (STARE) model can learn representations and structure in trajectory data through both supervisory tasks (e.g., classification), and self-supervisory tasks (e.g., masked modelling). We present experimental results on various synthetic and real trajectory datasets and show that our proposed model can learn meaningful encodings that are useful for many downstream tasks including discriminating between labels and indicating similarity between locations. Using these encodings, we also learn relationships between agents and locations present in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to be presented at GeoAI workshop at ACM SigSpatial 2024</p></details> |
| **[xTED: Cross-Domain Adaptation via Diffusion-Based Trajectory Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08687v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reusing pre-collected data from different domains is an appealing solution for decision-making tasks that have insufficient data in the target domain but are relatively abundant in other related domains. Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning domain/task-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer models? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data.

| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v4)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits. We deploy our approach on Husky UGV mobile platform, which move through the office corridors under proposed MPC local trajectory planner.

While prior works mostly rely on human feedback in the form of comparisons, language is a preferable modality that provides more informative insights into user preferences. In this work, we aim to incorporate comparative language feedback to iteratively improve robot trajectories and to learn reward functions that encode human preferences. To achieve this goal, we learn a shared latent space that integrates trajectory data and language feedback, and subsequently leverage the learned latent space to improve trajectories and learn human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate comparative language feedback into reward learning. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned latent space and the success of our learning algorithms. We also conduct human subject studies that show our reward learning algorithm achieves a 23.9% higher subjective score on average and is 11.3% more time-efficient compared to preference-based reward learning, underscoring the superior performance of our method.

In this paper, we study the problem of computing joint torques and grasping forces for time-optimal motion of an object, while ensuring that the grasp is not lost and any constraints on the motion of the object, either due to dynamics, environment contact, or no-slip requirements, are also satisfied. We present a second-order cone program (SOCP) formulation of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem that considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the hand-object and object-environment contacts. Since SOCPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved optimally in polynomial time using interior point methods, we can solve the trajectory optimization problem efficiently. We present simulation results on three examples, including a non-prehensile manipulation task, which shows the generality and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME). PREDICT more accurately infers nuanced human preferences improving over existing baselines by 66.2\% (gridworld environment) and 41.0\% (PLUME).</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Cyclists' Visual Preferences Through Shared Bike Trajectories and Street View Images Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03148v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cycling has gained global popularity for its health benefits and positive urban impacts. To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated visual preferences by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning(MEDIRL)and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing(DBS) trajectory and street view images(SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' visual preferences. We find that cyclists focus on specific street visual elements when making route decisions, which can be summarized as their attention to safety, street enclosure, and cycling comfort. Further analysis reveals the complex nonlinear effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a cost-effective perspective on streetscapes design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |

Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent research, planning three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories over a continuous temporal-spatial domain remains challenging due to the need to solve computationally intensive optimization problems. In this paper, we study UAV-assisted IoT data collection aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while accounting for the UAV's physical capabilities, the heterogeneous data demands of IoT nodes, and 3D terrain. We propose a matrix-based differential evolution with constraint handling (MDE-CH), a computation-efficient evolutionary algorithm designed to address non-convex constrained optimization problems with several different types of constraints.

This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 50% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

This necessitates advanced interactive multi-agent motion planning techniques. Generalized Nash equilibrium(GNE), a solution concept in constrained game theory, provides a mathematical model to predict the outcome of interactive motion planning, where each agent needs to account for other agents in the environment. However, in practice, multiple local GNEs may exist. Finding a single GNE itself is complex as it requires solving coupled constrained optimal control problems. Furthermore, finding all such local GNEs requires exploring the solution space of GNEs, which is a challenging task. This work proposes the MultiNash-PF framework to efficiently compute multiple local GNEs in constrained trajectory games. Potential games are a class of games for which a local GNE of a trajectory game can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem. We propose MultiNash-PF that integrates the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We first formulate the underlying game as a constrained potential game and then utilize the implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline approach.</p></details> |  |

This is crucial towards enhancing the practical implementation of the method in scenarios where solely data reflecting discrete snapshots of the system are available. We showcase the results of the method and the number of associated conservation laws obtained in a diverse range of examples including 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, the Toda lattice, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and the Calogero-Moser system.</p></details> |  |

TrajDiffuser is a statistical model that learns the multi-modal distributions of a dataset of simulated optimal trajectories, each subject to only one or few constraints that may vary for different trajectories. During inference, the trajectory is generated simultaneously over time, providing stable long-horizon planning, and constraints can be composed together, increasing the model's generalizability and decreasing the training data required. The generated trajectory is then used to initialize an optimizer, increasing its robustness and speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full manuscript submitted to IEEE Aerospace 2025 on 4-Oct-2024</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation for Multi-UAV-Assisted Sensing, Communication, and Edge Computing Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04151v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted integrated sensing, communication, and computation network. Specifically, the treble-functional UAVs are capable of offering communication and edge computing services to mobile users (MUs) in proximity, alongside their target sensing capabilities by using multi-input multi-output arrays. For the purpose of enhance the computation efficiency, we consider task compression, where each MU can partially compress their offloaded data prior to transmission to trim its size. The objective is to minimize the weighted energy consumption by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the UAVs' trajectories, the compression and offloading partition, the computation resource allocation, while fulfilling the causal-effect correlation between communication and computation as well as adhering to the constraints on sensing quality. To tackle it, we first reformulate the original problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP), which involves heterogeneous agents to decompose the large state spaces and action spaces of MDP. Then, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with attention mechanism to handle the decision-making problem. Simulation results validate the significant effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing energy consumption. Moreover, it demonstrates superior performance compared to the baselines in relation to resource utilization and convergence speed.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed trajectory is constructed by the concatenation of three circular arcs of varying radii. Such a trajectory guarantees a complete coverage of the maximum set of reachable lengths while minimising the number of changeover points in the trajectory to a maximum of two under all scenarios. Additionally, by using the notion of internally tangent circles, we expand the set of Circle-Circle-Circle trajectories to eight kinds, consisting of {LLL, LLR, LRR, LRL, RRL, RLL, RLR, RRR} paths. The paper presents a mathematical formulation of the proposed trajectory and the conditions for the existence and classification of each kind of trajectory. We also analyse the variation of the length of the trajectory using suitable elongation strategies and derive the set of reachable lengths for all pairs of oriented points. Finally, the results of this paper are illustrated using numerical simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Automatica</p></details> |
| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of Anomalous Geospatial Trajectories via Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03889v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies, commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data. This approach is the first of its kind to be applied to spatiotemporal data. By embedding $2+1$-dimensional spatiotemporal data into $\mathbb{R}^3$, we utilize persistent homology to detect loops within the trajectories in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our research reveals that, under normal conditions, trajectory data embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ over time do not form loops. Consequently, we can effectively identify anomalies characterized by the presence of loops within the trajectories. This method is robust and capable of detecting loops that are invariant to small perturbations, variations in geometric shape, and local coordinate projections. Additionally, our approach provides a novel perspective on anomaly detection, offering enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying atypical patterns in geospatial data. This approach has significant implications for various applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title: Identification of Anomalous Geospatial Trajectories via Persistent Homology Authors: Kyle Evans-Lee, Kevin Lamb Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures We present a method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies, commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data</p></details> |
| **[DOTS: Learning to Reason Dynamically in LLMs via Optimal Reasoning Trajectories Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03864v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Driven Parallel Trajectory Optimization in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06021v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground robots navigating in complex, dynamic environments must compute collision-free trajectories to avoid obstacles safely and efficiently. Nonconvex optimization is a popular method to compute a trajectory in real-time. However, these methods often converge to locally optimal solutions and frequently switch between different local minima, leading to inefficient and unsafe robot motion. In this work, We propose a novel topology-driven trajectory optimization strategy for dynamic environments that plans multiple distinct evasive trajectories to enhance the robot's behavior and efficiency. A global planner iteratively generates trajectories in distinct homotopy classes. These trajectories are then optimized by local planners working in parallel. While each planner shares the same navigation objectives, they are locally constrained to a specific homotopy class, meaning each local planner attempts a different evasive maneuver. The robot then executes the feasible trajectory with the lowest cost in a receding horizon manner. We demonstrate, on a mobile robot navigating among pedestrians, that our approach leads to faster and safer trajectories than existing planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Safe and Efficient Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Vehicles using B-spline with Incremental Path Flattening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02957v4)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based trajectory optimization with B-spline curves is widely used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to its fast convergence and continuous trajectory generation. However, the application of B-spline curves for path-velocity coupled trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been highly limited because it is challenging to reduce the over-approximation of the vehicle shape and to create a collision-free trajectory using B-spline curves while satisfying kinodynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes novel disc-type swept volume (SV), incremental path flattening (IPF), and kinodynamic feasibility penalty methods. The disc-type SV estimation method is a new technique to reduce SV over-approximation and is used to find collision points for IPF. In IPF, the collision points are used to push the trajectory away from obstacles and to iteratively increase the curvature weight, thereby reducing SV and generating a collision-free trajectory. Additionally, to satisfy kinodynamic constraints for AVs using B-spline curves, we apply a clamped B-spline curvature penalty along with longitudinal and lateral velocity and acceleration penalties. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various simulated environments. We also conducted a real-world experiment using an AV, and our results validate the simulated tracking performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 21 figures, 5 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores two global search problems in the circular restricted three-body problem: hybrid cost function of minimum fuel/time-of-flight and transfers to energy-dependent invariant manifolds. These problems display a fundamental structure either in the optimal control profile or the use of dynamical structures. We build on our prior generative machine learning framework to apply diffusion models to learn the conditional probability distribution of the search problem and analyze the model's capability to capture these structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |
| **[DiffuSolve: Diffusion-based Solver for Non-convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal trajectory design is computationally expensive for nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamical systems. The challenge arises from the non-convex nature of the optimization problem with multiple local optima, which usually requires a global search. Traditional numerical solvers struggle to find diverse solutions efficiently without appropriate initial guesses. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSolve, a general diffusion model-based solver for non-convex trajectory optimization. An expressive diffusion model is trained on pre-collected locally optimal solutions and efficiently samples initial guesses, which then warm-starts numerical solvers to fine-tune the feasibility and optimality. We also present DiffuSolve+, a novel constrained diffusion model with an additional loss in training that further reduces the problem constraint violations of diffusion samples. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved robustness, diversity, and a 2$\times$ to 11$\times$ increase in computational efficiency with our proposed method, which generalizes well to trajectory optimization problems of varying challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Generalization Performance Along the Trajectory of Proximal SGD in Robust Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02629v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the generalization performance of iterates obtained by Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and their proximal variants in high-dimensional robust regression problems. The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remember and Recall: Associative-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02201v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a pivotal component of autonomous driving systems, enabling the application of accumulated movement experience to current scenarios. Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction (FMTP) model, inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, we design a learnable memory array by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using defined quantization operations during the training phase. This approach further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, we develop an advanced reasoning engine based on language models to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Robot Trajectory Generation via Consensus ADMM: Convex vs. Non-Convex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01728v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>C-ADMM is a well-known distributed optimization framework due to its guaranteed convergence in convex optimization problems. Recently, C-ADMM has been studied in robotics applications such as multi-vehicle target tracking and collaborative manipulation tasks. However, few works have investigated the performance of C-ADMM applied to non-convex problems in robotics applications due to a lack of theoretical guarantees. For this project, we aim to quantitatively explore and examine the convergence behavior of non-convex C-ADMM through the scope of distributed multi-robot trajectory planning. We propose a convex trajectory planning problem by leveraging C-ADMM and Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVCs) to get around the non-convex collision avoidance constraint and compare this convex C-ADMM algorithm to a non-convex C-ADMM baseline with non-convex collision avoidance constraints. We show that the convex C-ADMM algorithm requires 1000 fewer iterations to achieve convergence in a multi-robot waypoint navigation scenario. We also confirm that the non-convex C-ADMM baseline leads to sub-optimal solutions and violation of safety constraints in trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoLife+: Large-Scale Simulated Trajectory Datasets Calibrated to the GeoLife Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11853v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing individual human trajectory data helps our understanding of human mobility and finds many commercial and academic applications. There are two main approaches to accessing trajectory data for research: one involves using real-world datasets like GeoLife, while the other employs simulations to synthesize data. Real-world data provides insights from real human activities, but such data is generally sparse due to voluntary participation. Conversely, simulated data can be more comprehensive but may capture unrealistic human behavior. In this Data and Resource paper, we combine the benefit of both by leveraging the statistical features of real-world data and the comprehensiveness of simulated data. Specifically, we extract features from the real-world GeoLife dataset such as the average number of individual daily trips, average radius of gyration, and maximum and minimum trip distances. We calibrate the Pattern of Life Simulation, a realistic simulation of human mobility, to reproduce these features. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm to calibrate the parameters of the simulation to mimic the GeoLife features. For this calibration, we simulated numerous random simulation settings, measured the similarity of generated trajectories to GeoLife, and iteratively (over many generations) combined parameter settings of trajectory datasets most similar to GeoLife. Using the calibrated simulation, we simulate large trajectory datasets that we call GeoLife+, where + denotes the Kleene Plus, indicating unlimited replication with at least one occurrence. We provide simulated GeoLife+ data with 182, 1k, and 5k over 5 years, 10k, and 50k over a year and 100k users over 6 months of simulation lifetime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at https://geosim.org/</p></details> |

The filter-combine framework parallels the popular aggregate-combine paradigm for graph neural networks (GNNs) and naturally suggests many interesting families of MNNs which can be interpreted as the manifold analog of various popular GNNs. We then propose a method for implementing MFCNs on high-dimensional point clouds that relies on approximating the manifold by a sparse graph. We prove that our method is consistent in the sense that it converges to a continuum limit as the number of data points tends to infinity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS Workshop on Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations (Extended Abstract Track)</p></details> |
| **[Are High-Degree Representations Really Unnecessary in Equivariant Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11443v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolecularGPT: Open Large Language Model (LLM) for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12950v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a fundamental and crucial task in drug discovery. However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large number of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for unseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a perspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction tasks. This enables building a versatile and specialized LLM that can be adapted to novel MPP tasks without any fine-tuning through zero- and few-shot in-context learning (ICL). MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context reasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new benchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks. More importantly, with just two-shot examples, MolecularGPT can outperform standard supervised graph neural network methods on 4 out of 7 datasets. It also excels state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 15.7% increase on classification accuracy and decrease of 17.9 on regression metrics (e.g., RMSE) under zero-shot. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as effective few-shot molecular property predictors. The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/MolecularGPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Enhanced Retrieval for Question Answering of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06572v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation has revolutionized large language model (LLM) outputs by providing factual supports. Nevertheless, it struggles to capture all the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval methods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in isolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages that are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize such relatedness for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by exploiting the relatedness between passages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by connecting passages that are structure-related or keyword-related. A graph neural network (GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between passages and improve the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we extend our method to handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates the graphs of passages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of supporting passages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-Ret achieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single query of LLMs than strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret further improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.4% accuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.</p></details> | Under review |

However, naively plugging PH features into GNN layers always results in marginal improvement with low interpretability. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism for injecting global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, motivated by the observation that filtration operation in PH naturally aligns graph pooling in a cut-off manner. In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance. Experimentally, we apply our mechanism to a collection of graph pooling methods and observe consistent and substantial performance gain over several popular datasets, demonstrating its wide applicability and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Current solutions often train hybrid models on auxiliary data for both cold and warm users/items, potentially degrading the experience for the latter. This drawback limits their viability in practical scenarios where the satisfaction of existing warm users/items is paramount. Although graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at warm recommendations by effective collaborative signal modeling, they haven't been effectively leveraged for the cold-start issue within a user-item graph, which is largely due to the lack of initial connections for cold user/item entities. Addressing this requires a GNN adept at cold-start recommendations without sacrificing performance for existing ones. To this end, we introduce Graph Neural Patching for Cold-Start Recommendations (GNP), a customized GNN framework with dual functionalities: GWarmer for modeling collaborative signal on existing warm users/items and Patching Networks for simulating and enhancing GWarmer's performance on cold-start recommendations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets confirm GNP's superiority in recommending both warm and cold users/items.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by Australasian Database Conference 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2209.12215</p></details> |

By employing vector quantization, we compress continuous node embeddings from multiple layers of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) into discrete codes, applicable under both self-supervised and supervised learning paradigms. These node IDs capture high-level abstractions of graph data and offer interpretability that traditional GNN embeddings lack. Extensive experiments on 34 datasets, encompassing node classification, graph classification, link prediction, and attributed graph clustering tasks, demonstrate that the generated node IDs significantly enhance speed and memory efficiency while achieving competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Their goal is to explain a model's predictions and thereby obtain trust when GNN models are deployed in decision critical applications. Most GNN explanation methods work in a post-hoc manner and provide explanations in the form of a small subset of important edges and/or nodes. In this paper we demonstrate that these explanations can unfortunately not be trusted, as common GNN explanation methods turn out to be highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations. That is, even small perturbations of the original graph structure that preserve the model's predictions may yield drastically different explanations. This calls into question the trustworthiness and practical utility of post-hoc explanation methods for GNNs. To be able to attack GNN explanation models, we devise a novel attack method dubbed \textit{GXAttack}, the first \textit{optimization-based} adversarial white-box attack method for post-hoc GNN explanations under such settings. Due to the devastating effectiveness of our attack, we call for an adversarial evaluation of future GNN explainers to demonstrate their robustness. For reproducibility, our code is available via GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPT: Competence-progressive Training Strategy for Few-shot Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00450v3)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advancements in node classification, but their success relies on sufficient labeled nodes per class in the training data. Real-world graph data often exhibits a long-tail distribution with sparse labels, emphasizing the importance of GNNs' ability in few-shot node classification, which entails categorizing nodes with limited data. Traditional episodic meta-learning approaches have shown promise in this domain, but they face an inherent limitation: it might lead the model to converge to suboptimal solutions because of random and uniform task assignment, ignoring task difficulty levels. This could lead the meta-learner to face complex tasks too soon, hindering proper learning. Ideally, the meta-learner should start with simple concepts and advance to more complex ones, like human learning. So, we introduce CPT, a novel two-stage curriculum learning method that aligns task difficulty with the meta-learner's progressive competence, enhancing overall performance. Specifically, in CPT's initial stage, the focus is on simpler tasks, fostering foundational skills for engaging with complex tasks later. Importantly, the second stage dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on the meta-learner's growing competence, aiming for optimal knowledge acquisition. Extensive experiments on popular node classification datasets demonstrate significant improvements of our strategy over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2206.11972 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Path-based Explanation for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02290v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) by modelling how entities and relations interact in recent years. However, the explanation of the predicted facts has not caught the necessary attention. Proper explanations for the results of GNN-based KGC models increase model transparency and help researchers develop more reliable models. Existing practices for explaining KGC tasks rely on instance/subgraph-based approaches, while in some scenarios, paths can provide more user-friendly and interpretable explanations. Nonetheless, the methods for generating path-based explanations for KGs have not been well-explored. To address this gap, we propose Power-Link, the first path-based KGC explainer that explores GNN-based models. We design a novel simplified graph-powering technique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fully parallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme. We further introduce three new metrics for quantitative evaluation of the explanations, together with a qualitative human evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-Link outperforms the SOTA baselines in interpretability, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks by Learning Continuous Edge Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14109v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) traditionally employ a message-passing mechanism that resembles diffusion over undirected graphs, which often leads to homogenization of node features and reduced discriminative power in tasks such as node classification. Our key insight for addressing this limitation is to assign fuzzy edge directions -- that can vary continuously from node $i$ pointing to node $j$ to vice versa -- to the edges of a graph so that features can preferentially flow in one direction between nodes to enable long-range information transmission across the graph. We also introduce a novel complex-valued Laplacian for directed graphs with fuzzy edges where the real and imaginary parts represent information flow in opposite directions. Using this Laplacian, we propose a general framework, called Continuous Edge Direction (CoED) GNN, for learning on graphs with fuzzy edges and prove its expressivity limits using a generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test for directed graphs with fuzzy edges. Our architecture aggregates neighbor features scaled by the learned edge directions and processes the aggregated messages from in-neighbors and out-neighbors separately alongside the self-features of the nodes. Since continuous edge directions are differentiable, they can be learned jointly with the GNN weights via gradient-based optimization. CoED GNN is particularly well-suited for graph ensemble data where the graph structure remains fixed but multiple realizations of node features are available, such as in gene regulatory networks, web connectivity graphs, and power grids. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets that learning continuous edge directions significantly improves performance both for undirected and directed graphs compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMGNN: Detecting and Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14105v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that GNNs are highly susceptible to multiple adversarial attacks. Among these, graph backdoor attacks pose one of the most prominent threats, where attackers cause models to misclassify by learning the backdoored features with injected triggers and modified target labels during the training phase. Based on the features of the triggers, these attacks can be categorized into out-of-distribution (OOD) and in-distribution (ID) graph backdoor attacks, triggers with notable differences from the clean sample feature distributions constitute OOD backdoor attacks, whereas the triggers in ID backdoor attacks are nearly identical to the clean sample feature distributions. Existing methods can successfully defend against OOD backdoor attacks by comparing the feature distribution of triggers and clean samples but fail to mitigate stealthy ID backdoor attacks. Due to the lack of proper supervision signals, the main task accuracy is negatively affected in defending against ID backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose DMGNN against OOD and ID graph backdoor attacks that can powerfully eliminate stealthiness to guarantee defense effectiveness and improve the model performance. Specifically, DMGNN can easily identify the hidden ID and OOD triggers via predicting label transitions based on counterfactual explanation. To further filter the diversity of generated explainable graphs and erase the influence of the trigger features, we present a reverse sampling pruning method to screen and discard the triggers directly on the data level. Extensive experimental evaluations on open graph datasets demonstrate that DMGNN far outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense methods, reducing the attack success rate to 5% with almost negligible degradation in model performance (within 3.5%).</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

As graph datasets grow, managing large, decentralized subgraphs becomes essential, particularly within federated learning frameworks. These frameworks face significant challenges, including missing neighbor information, which can compromise model reliability in safety-critical settings. Deployment of federated learning models trained in such settings necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of the models. This study extends the applicability of Conformal Prediction (CP), a well-established method for uncertainty quantification, to federated graph learning. We specifically tackle the missing links issue in distributed subgraphs to minimize its adverse effects on CP set sizes. We discuss data dependencies across the distributed subgraphs and establish conditions for CP validity and precise test-time coverage. We introduce a Variational Autoencoder-based approach for reconstructing missing neighbors to mitigate the negative impact of missing data. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding smaller prediction sets while ensuring coverage guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Graph Quantized Tokenizers for Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13798v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers serve as the backbone architectures of Foundational Models, where a domain-specific tokenizer helps them adapt to various domains. Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as a leading model in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities, with existing approaches relying on heuristics or GNNs co-trained with Transformers. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 out of 18 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Our multi-agent system features three key components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and planning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that dynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI agents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of MPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic potential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw dislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these atomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force calculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for physics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by reducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct all-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the dynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates vast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material properties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by several computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of advanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex systems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDeR: Safeguarding Efficiency, Balancing, and Robustness via Prototypical Graph Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13761v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training high-quality deep models necessitates vast amounts of data, resulting in overwhelming computational and memory demands. Recently, data pruning, distillation, and coreset selection have been developed to streamline data volume by retaining, synthesizing, or selecting a small yet informative subset from the full set. Among these methods, data pruning incurs the least additional training cost and offers the most practical acceleration benefits. However, it is the most vulnerable, often suffering significant performance degradation with imbalanced or biased data schema, thus raising concerns about its accuracy and reliability in on-device deployment. Therefore, there is a looming need for a new data pruning paradigm that maintains the efficiency of previous practices while ensuring balance and robustness. Unlike the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, where mature solutions have been developed to address these issues, graph neural networks (GNNs) continue to struggle with increasingly large-scale, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, lacking a unified dataset pruning solution. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dynamic soft-pruning method, GDeR, designed to update the training ``basket'' during the process using trainable prototypes. GDeR first constructs a well-modeled graph embedding hypersphere and then samples \textit{representative, balanced, and unbiased subsets} from this embedding space, which achieves the goal we called Graph Training Debugging. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three GNN backbones, demonstrate that GDeR (I) achieves or surpasses the performance of the full dataset with 30%~50% fewer training samples, (II) attains up to a 2.81x lossless training speedup, and (III) outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in imbalanced training and noisy training scenarios by 0.3%~4.3% and 3.6%~7.8%, respectively.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Evaluating the behaviour of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in both safety-critical and regular scenarios is essential for assessing their robustness before real-world deployment. By integrating scenarios derived from real-world datasets into the simulation, we enhance the plausibility and validity of testing sets. This work introduces a novel approach that employs temporal scene graphs to capture evolving spatiotemporal relationships among scene entities from a real-world dataset, enabling the generation of dynamic scenarios in simulation through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). User-defined action and criticality conditioning are used to ensure flexible, tailored scenario creation. Our model significantly outperforms the benchmarks in accurately predicting links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We further evaluate the validity and compatibility of our generated scenarios in an off-the-shelf simulator.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Interpreting Temporal Graph Neural Networks with Koopman Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13469v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have shown promising results in many domains, from forecasting to epidemiology. However, understanding the dynamics learned by these models and explaining their behaviour is significantly more complex than for models dealing with static data. Inspired by Koopman theory, which allows a simpler description of intricate, nonlinear dynamical systems, we introduce an explainability approach for temporal graphs. We present two methods to interpret the STGNN's decision process and identify the most relevant spatial and temporal patterns in the input for the task at hand. The first relies on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a Koopman-inspired dimensionality reduction method. The second relies on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a popular method for discovering governing equations, which we use for the first time as a general tool for explainability. We show how our methods can correctly identify interpretable features such as infection times and infected nodes in the context of dissemination processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Invariant Principle for Heterophilic Graph Structure Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09490v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results for semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs. Notably, most real-world heterophilic graphs are composed of a mixture of nodes with different neighbor patterns, exhibiting local node-level homophilic and heterophilic structures. However, existing works are only devoted to designing better HGNN backbones or architectures for node classification tasks on heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks simultaneously, and their analyses of HGNN performance with respect to nodes are only based on the determined data distribution without exploring the effect caused by this structural difference between training and testing nodes. How to learn invariant node representations on heterophilic graphs to handle this structure difference or distribution shifts remains unexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of previous graph-based invariant learning methods from the perspective of data augmentation. Then, we propose \textbf{HEI}, a framework capable of generating invariant node representations through incorporating heterophily information to infer latent environments without augmentation, which are then used for invariant prediction, under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. We theoretically show that our proposed method can achieve guaranteed performance under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and backbones can also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Addressing Heterogeneity and Heterophily in Graphs: A Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13373v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant scholarly attention for their powerful capabilities in modeling graph structures. Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Existing studies often address heterogeneous and heterophilic graphs separately, leaving a research gap in the understanding of heterogeneous heterophilic graphs-those that feature diverse node or relation types with dissimilar connected nodes. To address this gap, we investigate the application of spectral graph filters within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs a dual-module approach: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. The local independent filtering module applies polynomial filters to each subgraph independently to adapt to different homophily, while the global hybrid filtering module captures interactions across different subgraphs. Extensive empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of H2SGNN compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, our experiments reveal that this problem can uncover underlying properties of node anomaly detection (NAD) that previous research has missed. We introduce Individual Smoothing Patterns (ISP) and Neighborhood Smoothing Patterns (NSP), which indicate that the representations of anomalous nodes are harder to smooth than those of normal ones. In addition, we explore the theoretical implications of these patterns, demonstrating the potential benefits of ISP and NSP for NAD tasks. Motivated by these findings, we propose SmoothGNN, a novel unsupervised NAD framework. First, we design a learning component to explicitly capture ISP for detecting node anomalies. Second, we design a spectral graph neural network to implicitly learn ISP to enhance detection. Third, we design an effective coefficient based on our findings that NSP can serve as coefficients for node representations, aiding in the identification of anomalous nodes. Furthermore, we devise a novel anomaly measure to calculate loss functions and anomalous scores for nodes, reflecting the properties of NAD using ISP and NSP. Extensive experiments on 9 real datasets show that SmoothGNN outperforms the best rival by an average of 14.66% in AUC and 7.28% in Average Precision, with 75x running time speedup, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods, often fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases or explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we propose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting gene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes. Graphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific networks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three modules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from patient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures representations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring accurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two representations using an inference loss that leverages graph generation capabilities, conditioned on the patient separation loss, to refine subtype-specific information in the learned representation. GeSubNet consistently outperforms traditional methods, with average improvements of 30.6%, 21.0%, 20.1%, and 56.6% across four graph evaluation metrics, averaged over four cancer datasets. Particularly, we conduct a biological simulation experiment to assess how the behavior of selected genes from over 11,000 candidates affects subtypes or patient distributions. The results show that the generated network has the potential to identify subtype-specific genes with an 83% likelihood of impacting patient distribution shifts.

HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 Graphic Compute Dies (GCDs) on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Each HPO trial was ranked based on both accuracy and energy consumption. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures (selected with judicious balance between accuracy and energy consumption) continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contributions establish core capabilities for rapidly developing, training, and deploying further GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</p></details> | 20 pages, 25 figures |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems.

However, deploying these approaches for large-scale networks poses significant challenges. In this paper, we leverage the power of heterogeneous graph neural networks to propose a novel end-to-end surrogate model for traffic assignment, specifically user equilibrium traffic assignment problems. Our model integrates an adaptive graph attention mechanism with auxiliary "virtual" links connecting origin-destination node pairs, This integration enables the model to capture spatial traffic patterns across different links, By incorporating the node-based flow conservation law into the overall loss function, the model ensures the prediction results in compliance with flow conservation principles, resulting in highly accurate predictions for both link flow and flow-capacity ratios. We present numerical experiments on urban transportation networks and show that the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model outperforms other conventional neural network models in terms of convergence rate and prediction accuracy. Notably, by introducing two different training strategies, the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model can also be generalized to different network topologies. This approach offers a promising solution for complex traffic flow analysis and prediction, enhancing our understanding and management of a wide range of transportation systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning Representations for Reasoning: Generalizing Across Diverse Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13018v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning, the ability to logically draw conclusions from existing knowledge, is a hallmark of human. Together with perception, they constitute the two major themes of artificial intelligence. While deep learning has pushed the limit of perception beyond human-level performance, the progress in reasoning domains is way behind. One fundamental reason is that reasoning problems usually have flexible structures for both knowledge and queries, and many existing models only perform well on structures seen during training. Here we aim to push the boundary of reasoning models by devising algorithms that generalize across knowledge and query structures, as well as systems that accelerate development on structured data. This thesis consists of three parts. In Part I, we study models that can inductively generalize to unseen knowledge graphs with new entity and relation vocabularies. For new entities, we propose a framework that learns neural operators in a dynamic programming algorithm computing path representations. For relations, we construct a relation graph to capture the interactions between relations, thereby converting new relations into new entities. In Part II, we propose two solutions for generalizing across multi-step queries on knowledge graphs and text respectively. For knowledge graphs, we show that multi-step queries can be solved by multiple calls of graph neural networks and fuzzy logic operations. For text, we devise an algorithm to learn explicit knowledge as textual rules to improve large language models on multi-step queries. In Part III, we propose two systems to facilitate machine learning development on structured data. Our library treats structured data as first-class citizens and removes the barrier for developing algorithms on structured data. Our node embedding system solves the GPU memory bottleneck of embedding matrices and scales to graphs with billion nodes.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

However, weather forecast products from machine learning or numerical weather models are currently generated on a global regular grid, on which a naive interpolation cannot accurately reflect fine-grained weather patterns close to the ground. In this work, we train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. This multi-modal GNN takes advantage of local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature) to correct the gridded weather forecast at different lead times towards locally accurate forecasts. Each data modality is modeled as a different type of node in the graph. Using message passing, the node at the prediction location aggregates information from its heterogeneous neighbor nodes. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. Our approach demonstrates how the gap between global large-scale weather models and locally accurate predictions can be bridged to inform localized decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance.</p></details> |  |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |

Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based learning framework, NAR-*ICP, which learns the intermediate algorithmic steps of classical ICP-based pointcloud registration algorithms, and extend the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark with classical robotics perception algorithms. We evaluate our approach across diverse datasets, from real-world to synthetic, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex and noisy inputs, along with its potential to be used as part of a larger learning system. Our results indicate that our method achieves superior performance across all benchmarks and datasets, consistently surpassing even the algorithms it has been trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

However, real-world scenarios often present challenges related to user privacy and business constraints, inhibiting direct access to valuable social information from other platforms. While many existing methods have tackled matrix factorization-based social recommendations without direct social data access, developing GNN-based federated social recommendation models under similar conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose a novel vertical federated social recommendation method leveraging privacy-preserving two-party graph convolution networks (P4GCN) to enhance recommendation accuracy without requiring direct access to sensitive social information. First, we introduce a Sandwich-Encryption module to ensure comprehensive data privacy during the collaborative computing process. Second, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees, considering the participation of both curious and honest parties. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P4GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.

Existing defense methods typically rely on assumptions like graph sparsity and homophily to either preprocess the graph or guide structure learning. However, preprocessing methods often struggle to accurately distinguish between normal edges and adversarial perturbations, leading to suboptimal results due to the loss of valuable edge information. Robust graph neural network models train directly on graph data affected by adversarial perturbations, without preprocessing. This can cause the model to get stuck in poor local optima, negatively affecting its performance. To address these challenges, we propose Perseus, a novel adversarial defense method based on curriculum learning. Perseus assesses edge difficulty using global homophily and applies a curriculum learning strategy to adjust the learning order, guiding the model to learn the full graph structure while adaptively focusing on common data patterns. This approach mitigates the impact of adversarial perturbations. Experiments show that models trained with Perseus achieve superior performance and are significantly more robust to adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

They constitute an emerging class of hybrid rigid-soft robotic systems and are promising systems for a wide array of applications, ranging from locomotion to assembly. They are difficult to control and model accurately, however, due to their compliance and high number of degrees of freedom. To address this issue, prior work has introduced a differentiable physics engine designed for tensegrity robots based on first principles. In contrast, this work proposes the use of graph neural networks to model contact dynamics over a graph representation of tensegrity robots, which leverages their natural graph-like cable connectivity between end caps of rigid rods. This learned simulator can accurately model 3-bar and 6-bar tensegrity robot dynamics in simulation-to-simulation experiments where MuJoCo is used as the ground truth. It can also achieve higher accuracy than the previous differentiable engine for a real 3-bar tensegrity robot, for which the robot state is only partially observable. When compared against direct applications of recent mesh-based graph neural network simulators, the proposed approach is computationally more efficient, both for training and inference, while achieving higher accuracy.

This model enables understanding of which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and molecular fragment connections are critical in the prediction of a given molecular property. The ability to interpret the importance of connections between fragments is of particular interest for molecules which have substructures that are not connected with regular covalent bonds.

Several modules in self-driving cars are thoroughly investigated to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency, among which the controller is crucial. The controller module can be categorized into longitudinal and lateral controllers in which the task of the former is to follow the reference velocity, and the latter is to reduce the lateral displacement error from the reference path. Generally, a tuned controller is not sufficient to perform in all environments. Thus, a controller that can adapt to changing conditions is necessary for autonomous driving. Furthermore, these controllers often depend on vehicle models that also need to adapt over time due to varying environments. This paper uses graphs to present novel techniques to learn the vehicle model and the lateral controller online. First, a heterogeneous graph is presented depicting the current states of and inputs to the vehicle. The vehicle model is then learned online using known physical constraints in conjunction with the processing of the graph through a Graph Neural Network structure. Next, another heterogeneous graph - depicting the transition from current to desired states - is processed through another Graph Neural Network structure to generate the steering command on the fly. Finally, the performance of this self-learning model-based lateral controller is evaluated and shown to be satisfactory on an open-source autonomous driving platform called CARLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been published in the early access area on IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (2024).

Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.</p></details> |  |

The ideal classifier must adapt to any imbalances in the class distribution. It must also use information in the clustering structure of real-world graphs. Existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have not addressed both problems together. We propose the Enhanced Cluster-aware Graph Network (ECGN), a novel method that addresses these issues by integrating cluster-specific training with synthetic node generation. Unlike traditional GNNs that apply the same node update process for all nodes, ECGN learns different aggregations for different clusters. We also use the clusters to generate new minority-class nodes in a way that helps clarify the inter-class decision boundary. By combining cluster-aware embeddings with a global integration step, ECGN enhances the quality of the resulting node embeddings. Our method works with any underlying GNN and any cluster generation technique. Experimental results show that ECGN consistently outperforms its closest competitors by up to 11% on some widely studied benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

The language's syntax is introduced, and its meaning is rigorously defined by a denotational semantics. An equivalent characterization in the form of an operational semantics is also provided and, together with a type system, is used to prove the type soundness of $\mu\mathcal{G}$. We show how $\mu\mathcal{G}$ programs can be represented in a more user-friendly graphical visualization, and provide examples of its generality by showing how it can be used to define some of the most popular graph neural network models, or to develop any custom graph processing application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fair Graph Representation Learning in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11493v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning from network data, the fairness of GNN models has raised great attention lately. Fair GNNs aim to ensure that node representations can be accurately classified, but not easily associated with a specific group. Existing advanced approaches essentially enhance the generalisation of node representation in combination with data augmentation strategy, and do not directly impose constraints on the fairness of GNNs. In this work, we identify that a fundamental reason for the unfairness of GNNs in social network learning is the phenomenon of social homophily, i.e., users in the same group are more inclined to congregate. The message-passing mechanism of GNNs can cause users in the same group to have similar representations due to social homophily, leading model predictions to establish spurious correlations with sensitive attributes. Inspired by this reason, we propose a method called Equity-Aware GNN (EAGNN) towards fair graph representation learning. Specifically, to ensure that model predictions are independent of sensitive attributes while maintaining prediction performance, we introduce constraints for fair representation learning based on three principles: sufficiency, independence, and separation. We theoretically demonstrate that our EAGNN method can effectively achieve group fairness. Extensive experiments on three datasets with varying levels of social homophily illustrate that our EAGNN method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across two fairness metrics and offers competitive effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

While rich user-item interactions are important, eBay's data sparsity exceeds other e-commerce sites by an order of magnitude. To address this challenge, we propose CoActionGraphRec (CAGR), a text based two-tower deep learning model (Item Tower and User Tower) utilizing co-action graph layers. In order to enhance user and item representations, a graph-based solution tailored to eBay's environment is utilized. For the Item Tower, we represent each item using its co-action items to capture collaborative signals in a co-action graph that is fully leveraged by the graph neural network component. For the User Tower, we build a fully connected graph of each user's behavior sequence, with edges encoding pairwise relationships. Furthermore, an explicit interaction module learns representations capturing behavior interactions. Extensive offline and online A/B test experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and results show improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on key metrics.</p></details> |  |

We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Given that ST data consists of non-stationary and complex time events, interpreting and predicting such trends is comparatively complicated. Representation of ST data in modes helps us to infer behavior and assess the impact of noise on prediction applications. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into modes using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method, which is then fed into the neural network for forecasting future states. This hybrid approach is known as a variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN). Instead of exhaustively searching for the number of modes, they are determined using the reconstruction loss from the real-time application data. We also study the significance of each mode and the impact of bandwidth constraints on different horizon predictions in traffic flow data. We evaluate the performance of our proposed network on the LargeST dataset for both short and long-term predictions.

Deep learning, with its ability to capture complex nonlinear patterns in spatiotemporal (ST) data, has emerged as a powerful tool for traffic forecasting. While graph neural networks (GCNs) and transformer-based models have shown promise, their computational demands often hinder their application to real-world road networks, particularly those with large-scale spatiotemporal interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph transformer (STGformer) architecture. STGformer effectively balances the strengths of GCNs and Transformers, enabling efficient modeling of both global and local traffic patterns while maintaining a manageable computational footprint. Unlike traditional approaches that require multiple attention layers, STG attention block captures high-order spatiotemporal interactions in a single layer, significantly reducing computational cost. In particular, STGformer achieves a 100x speedup and a 99.8\% reduction in GPU memory usage compared to STAEformer during batch inference on a California road graph with 8,600 sensors. We evaluate STGformer on the LargeST benchmark and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods such as PDFormer and STAEformer, which underline STGformer's potential to revolutionize traffic forecasting by overcoming the computational and memory limitations of existing approaches, making it a promising foundation for future spatiotemporal modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |

It offers a privacy-preserving solution for training GNNs using isolated graph data. Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network (VFGNN) is an important branch of FedGNN, where data features and labels are distributed among participants, and each participant has the same sample space. Due to the difficulty of accessing and modifying distributed data and labels, the vulnerability of VFGNN to backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this context, we propose BVG, the first method for backdoor attacks in VFGNN. Without accessing or modifying labels, BVG uses multi-hop triggers and requires only four target class nodes for an effective backdoor attack. Experiments show that BVG achieves high attack success rates (ASR) across three datasets and three different GNN models, with minimal impact on main task accuracy (MTA). We also evaluate several defense methods, further validating the robustness and effectiveness of BVG. This finding also highlights the need for advanced defense mechanisms to counter sophisticated backdoor attacks in practical VFGNN applications.</p></details> |  |

Graph continual learning (GCL) tackles this problem by continually adapting GNNs to the expanded graph of the current task while maintaining the performance over the graph of previous tasks. Memory replay-based methods, which aim to replay data of previous tasks when learning new tasks, have been explored as one principled approach to mitigate the forgetting of the knowledge learned from the previous tasks. In this paper we extend this methodology with a novel framework, called Debiased Lossless Memory replay (DeLoMe). Unlike existing methods that sample nodes/edges of previous graphs to construct the memory, DeLoMe learns small lossless synthetic node representations as the memory. The learned memory can not only preserve the graph data privacy but also capture the holistic graph information, for which the sampling-based methods are not viable. Further, prior methods suffer from bias toward the current task due to the data imbalance between the classes in the memory data and the current data. A debiased GCL loss function is devised in DeLoMe to effectively alleviate this bias. Extensive experiments on four graph datasets show the effectiveness of DeLoMe under both class- and task-incremental learning settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2024</p></details> |

Unlike traditional similar relationships, items with complementary relationships may be purchased successively (such as iPhone and Airpods Pro), and they not only share relevance but also exhibit dissimilarity. Since the two attributes are opposites, modeling complementary relationships is challenging. Previous attempts to exploit these relationships have either ignored or oversimplified the dissimilarity attribute, resulting in ineffective modeling and an inability to balance the two attributes. Since Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can capture the relevance and dissimilarity between nodes in the spectral domain, we can leverage spectral-based GNNs to effectively understand and model complementary relationships. In this study, we present a novel approach called Spectral-based Complementary Graph Neural Networks (SComGNN) that utilizes the spectral properties of complementary item graphs. We make the first observation that complementary relationships consist of low-frequency and mid-frequency components, corresponding to the relevance and dissimilarity attributes, respectively. Based on this spectral observation, we design spectral graph convolutional networks with low-pass and mid-pass filters to capture the low-frequency and mid-frequency components. Additionally, we propose a two-stage attention mechanism to adaptively integrate and balance the two attributes. Experimental results on four e-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, with SComGNN significantly outperforming existing baseline models.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-24 |

However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index.

Unlike their single-agent counterparts, multi-agent systems necessitate successful cooperation among the agents. The deployment of these systems in real-world scenarios often requires decentralized training, a diverse set of agents, and learning from infrequent environmental reward signals. These challenges become more pronounced under partial observability and the lack of prior knowledge about agent heterogeneity. While notable studies use intrinsic motivation (IM) to address reward sparsity or cooperation in decentralized settings, those dealing with heterogeneity typically assume centralized training, parameter sharing, and agent indexing. To overcome these limitations, we propose the CoHet algorithm, which utilizes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based intrinsic motivation to facilitate the learning of heterogeneous agent policies in decentralized settings, under the challenges of partial observability and reward sparsity. Evaluation of CoHet in the Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE) and Vectorized Multi-Agent Simulator (VMAS) benchmarks demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in a range of cooperative multi-agent scenarios. Our research is supplemented by an analysis of the impact of the agent dynamics model on the intrinsic motivation module, insights into the performance of different CoHet variants, and its robustness to an increasing number of heterogeneous agents.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

However, this also imposes several limitations in node classification applications: 1) nodes are susceptible to global noise; 2) self-attention computation cannot scale well to large graphs. In this work, we conduct extensive observational experiments to explore the adaptability of the GT architecture in node classification tasks and draw several conclusions: the current multi-head self-attention module in GT can be completely replaceable, while the feed-forward neural network module proves to be valuable. Based on this, we decouple the propagation (P) and transformation (T) of GNNs and explore a powerful GT architecture, named GNNFormer, which is based on the P/T combination message passing and adapted for node classification in both homophilous and heterophilous scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed GT architecture can effectively adapt to node classification tasks without being affected by global noise and computational efficiency limitations.</p></details> |  |

With the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been growing interest in integrating LLMs for graph learning. However, applying LLMs to graph-related tasks poses significant challenges, as these models are not inherently designed to capture the complex structural information present in graphs. Existing approaches address this challenge through two strategies: the chain of tasks approach, which uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the graph structure so that LLMs are relieved from understanding spatial positions; and Graph-to-Text Conversion, which translates graph structures into semantic text representations that LLMs can process. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle to fully preserve the topological information of graphs or require extensive computational resources, limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we introduce Node Tokenizer for Large Language Models (NT-LLM), a novel framework that efficiently encodes graph structures by selecting key nodes as anchors and representing each node based on its relative distance to these anchors. This position-anchored encoding effectively captures the graph topology, enabling enhanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs over graph data. Additionally, we implement a task-specific tuning procedure to further improve structural understanding within LLMs. Through extensive empirical evaluations, NT-LLM demonstrates significant performance improvements across a variety of graph-related tasks.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, an AI-based assistant has been developed which utilises the collected data to provide personalised recommendations regarding courses and study groups for students. The objective is to examine the relationship between students' course selection preferences and their academic interest levels. Based on the results of the relationship analysis, the AI assistant employs technologies such as GNN to recommend suitable courses and study groups to students.

Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods.

While it is standard to apply graph neural networks for such tasks, Gaussian processes can also be used, by transforming graph features into the spectral domain, and using the resulting spectral features as input points. However, this approach only takes into account features on vertices, whereas some graph data also support features on edges. In this work, we present a Gaussian process-based classification algorithm that can utilise vertex and/or edges features to help classify graphs. Furthermore, we take advantage of the Hodge decomposition of vertex and edge features to increase the flexibility of the model, which can be beneficial on some tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Bayesian Decision-Making and Uncertainty (oral presentation)</p></details> |

This vulnerability has led to interest in certifying (i.e., proving) that such changes up to a certain magnitude do not affect test predictions. We, for the first time, certify Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against poisoning attacks, including backdoors, targeting the node features of a given graph. Our certificates are white-box and based upon $(i)$ the neural tangent kernel, which characterizes the training dynamics of sufficiently wide networks; and $(ii)$ a novel reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem describing poisoning as a mixed-integer linear program. Consequently, we leverage our framework to provide fundamental insights into the role of graph structure and its connectivity on the worst-case robustness behavior of convolution-based and PageRank-based GNNs. We note that our framework is more general and constitutes the first approach to derive white-box poisoning certificates for NNs, which can be of independent interest beyond graph-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this work appeared at the AdvML-Frontiers @ NeurIPS 2024 workshop</p></details> |
| **[Replay-and-Forget-Free Graph Class-Incremental Learning: A Task Profiling and Prompting Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10341v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continually learn a sequence of tasks, with each task consisting of a set of unique classes. Graph CIL (GCIL) follows the same setting but needs to deal with graph tasks (e.g., node classification in a graph). The key characteristic of CIL lies in the absence of task identifiers (IDs) during inference, which causes a significant challenge in separating classes from different tasks (i.e., inter-task class separation). Being able to accurately predict the task IDs can help address this issue, but it is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show theoretically that accurate task ID prediction on graph data can be achieved by a Laplacian smoothing-based graph task profiling approach, in which each graph task is modeled by a task prototype based on Laplacian smoothing over the graph. It guarantees that the task prototypes of the same graph task are nearly the same with a large smoothing step, while those of different tasks are distinct due to differences in graph structure and node attributes. Further, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge learned in previous graph tasks, we propose a novel graph prompting approach for GCIL which learns a small discriminative graph prompt for each task, essentially resulting in a separate classification model for each task. The prompt learning requires the training of a single graph neural network (GNN) only once on the first task, and no data replay is required thereafter, thereby obtaining a GCIL model being both replay-free and forget-free. Extensive experiments on four GCIL benchmarks show that i) our task prototype-based method can achieve 100% task ID prediction accuracy on all four datasets, ii) our GCIL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 18% in average CIL accuracy, and iii) our model is fully free of forgetting on the four datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[DiRW: Path-Aware Digraph Learning for Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10320v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information embedded in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world (e.g., social networks and recommendations) and are also confirmed to offer a new perspective for addressing topological heterophily challenges (i.e., connected nodes have complex patterns of feature distribution or labels). Despite recent significant advancements in DiGNNs, existing spatial- and spectral-based methods have inherent limitations due to the complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, leading to low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), which can be viewed as a plug-and-play strategy or an innovative neural architecture that provides a guidance or new learning paradigm for most spatial-based methods or digraphs. Specifically, DiRW incorporates a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topological structure. Building upon this, DiRW utilizes a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized messages obtained by our proposed adaptive walkers to represent the current node. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Enhancing Attributed Graph Networks with Alignment and Uniformity Constraints for Session-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10296v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based Recommendation (SBR), seeking to predict a user's next action based on an anonymous session, has drawn increasing attention for its practicability. Most SBR models only rely on the contextual transitions within a short session to learn item representations while neglecting additional valuable knowledge. As such, their model capacity is largely limited by the data sparsity issue caused by short sessions. A few studies have exploited the Modeling of Item Attributes (MIA) to enrich item representations. However, they usually involve specific model designs that can hardly transfer to existing attribute-agnostic SBR models and thus lack universality. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named AttrGAU (Attributed Graph Networks with Alignment and Uniformity Constraints), to bring the MIA's superiority into existing attribute-agnostic models, to improve their accuracy and robustness for recommendation. Specifically, we first build a bipartite attributed graph and design an attribute-aware graph convolution to exploit the rich attribute semantics hidden in the heterogeneous item-attribute relationship. We then decouple existing attribute-agnostic SBR models into the graph neural network and attention readout sub-modules to satisfy the non-intrusive requirement. Lastly, we design two representation constraints, i.e., alignment and uniformity, to optimize distribution discrepancy in representation between the attribute semantics and collaborative semantics. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AttrGAU framework can significantly enhance backbone models' recommendation performance and robustness against data sparsity and data noise issues. Our implementation codes will be available at https://github.com/ItsukiFujii/AttrGAU.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables.

Research in this field generally consist of two main perspectives: local-level encoding and global-level aggregating, respectively refer to textual node information unification (e.g., using Language Models) and structure-augmented modeling (e.g., using Graph Neural Networks). Most existing works focus on combining different information levels but overlook the interconnections, i.e., the contextual textual information among nodes, which provides semantic insights to bridge local and global levels. In this paper, we propose GraphBridge, a multi-granularity integration framework that bridges local and global perspectives by leveraging contextual textual information, enhancing fine-grained understanding of TAGs. Besides, to tackle scalability and efficiency challenges, we introduce a graphaware token reduction module. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets show that our method achieves state-of-theart performance, while our graph-aware token reduction module significantly enhances efficiency and solves scalability issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024(Main)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Bridging Generalization and Expressivity of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10051v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressivity and generalization are two critical aspects of graph neural networks (GNNs). While significant progress has been made in studying the expressivity of GNNs, much less is known about their generalization capabilities, particularly when dealing with the inherent complexity of graph-structured data. In this work, we address the intricate relationship between expressivity and generalization in GNNs. Theoretical studies conjecture a trade-off between the two: highly expressive models risk overfitting, while those focused on generalization may sacrifice expressivity. However, empirical evidence often contradicts this assumption, with expressive GNNs frequently demonstrating strong generalization. We explore this contradiction by introducing a novel framework that connects GNN generalization to the variance in graph structures they can capture. This leads us to propose a $k$-variance margin-based generalization bound that characterizes the structural properties of graph embeddings in terms of their upper-bounded expressive power. Our analysis does not rely on specific GNN architectures, making it broadly applicable across GNN models. We further uncover a trade-off between intra-class concentration and inter-class separation, both of which are crucial for effective generalization. Through case studies and experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings align with empirical results, offering a deeper understanding of how expressivity can enhance GNN generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Online Multi-modal Root Cause Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10021v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is essential for pinpointing the root causes of failures in microservice systems. Traditional data-driven RCA methods are typically limited to offline applications due to high computational demands, and existing online RCA methods handle only single-modal data, overlooking complex interactions in multi-modal systems. In this paper, we introduce OCEAN, a novel online multi-modal causal structure learning method for root cause localization. OCEAN employs a dilated convolutional neural network to capture long-term temporal dependencies and graph neural networks to learn causal relationships among system entities and key performance indicators. We further design a multi-factor attention mechanism to analyze and reassess the relationships among different metrics and log indicators/attributes for enhanced online causal graph learning. Additionally, a contrastive mutual information maximization-based graph fusion module is developed to effectively model the relationships across various modalities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards characterizing the value of edge embeddings in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09867v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the dominant approach to solving machine learning problems defined over graphs. Despite much theoretical and empirical work in recent years, our understanding of finer-grained aspects of architectural design for GNNs remains impoverished. In this paper, we consider the benefits of architectures that maintain and update edge embeddings. On the theoretical front, under a suitable computational abstraction for a layer in the model, as well as memory constraints on the embeddings, we show that there are natural tasks on graphical models for which architectures leveraging edge embeddings can be much shallower. Our techniques are inspired by results on time-space tradeoffs in theoretical computer science. Empirically, we show architectures that maintain edge embeddings almost always improve on their node-based counterparts -- frequently significantly so in topologies that have ``hub'' nodes.</p></details> | 25 pages, 2 figures |

This thesis puts forth notions of rank as key for developing a theory of deep learning, focusing on the fundamental aspects of generalization and expressiveness. In particular, we establish that gradient-based training can induce an implicit regularization towards low rank for several neural network architectures, and demonstrate empirically that this phenomenon may facilitate an explanation of generalization over natural data (e.g., audio, images, and text). Then, we characterize the ability of graph neural networks to model interactions via a notion of rank, which is commonly used for quantifying entanglement in quantum physics. A central tool underlying these results is a connection between neural networks and tensor factorizations. Practical implications of our theory for designing explicit regularization schemes and data preprocessing algorithms are presented.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Towards Stable, Globally Expressive Graph Representations with Laplacian Eigenvectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09737v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in a variety of machine learning tasks over graph data. Existing GNNs usually rely on message passing, i.e., computing node representations by gathering information from the neighborhood, to build their underlying computational graphs. They are known fairly limited in expressive power, and often fail to capture global characteristics of graphs. To overcome the issue, a popular solution is to use Laplacian eigenvectors as additional node features, as they contain global positional information of nodes, and can serve as extra node identifiers aiding GNNs to separate structurally similar nodes. For such an approach, properly handling the orthogonal group symmetry among eigenvectors with equal eigenvalue is crucial for its stability and generalizability. However, using a naive orthogonal group invariant encoder for each separate eigenspace may not keep the full expressivity in the Laplacian eigenvectors. Moreover, computing such invariants inevitably entails a hard split of Laplacian eigenvalues according to their numerical identity, which suffers from great instability when the graph structure is perturbed. In this paper, we propose a novel method exploiting Laplacian eigenvectors to generate stable and globally expressive graph representations. The main difference from previous works is that (i) our method utilizes learnable orthogonal group invariant representations for each Laplacian eigenspace, based upon powerful orthogonal group equivariant neural network layers already well studied in the literature, and that (ii) our method deals with numerically close eigenvalues in a smooth fashion, ensuring its better robustness against perturbations. Experiments on various graph learning benchmarks witness the competitive performance of our method, especially its great potential to learn global properties of graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Node-Time Conditional Prompt Learning In Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13937v7)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs capture evolving interactions between entities, such as in social networks, online learning platforms, and crowdsourcing projects. For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique. However, they are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs, but most existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DYGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and temporal variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DYGPROMPT through extensive experiments on four public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

Prior studies have attempted to enhance GNN performance by reconstructing node features during the testing phase without modifying the model parameters. However, these approaches lack theoretical analysis of the proximity between predictions and ground truth at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel node feature reconstruction method grounded in Lyapunov stability theory. Specifically, we model the GNN as a control system during the testing phase, considering node features as control variables. A neural controller that adheres to the Lyapunov stability criterion is then employed to reconstruct these node features, ensuring that the predictions progressively approach the ground truth at test time. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of Compositional Tasks with Logical Specification via Implicit Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09686v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the problem of learning generalizable policies for compositional tasks given by a logic specification. These tasks are composed by temporally extended subgoals. Due to dependencies of subgoals and long task horizon, previous reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, e.g., task-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, still suffer from slow convergence and sub-optimality when solving the generalization problem of compositional tasks. In order to tackle these issues, this paper proposes a new hierarchical RL framework for the efficient and optimal generalization of compositional tasks. In the high level, we propose a new implicit planner designed specifically for generalizing compositional tasks. Specifically, the planner produces the selection of next sub-task and estimates the multi-step return of completing the rest of task from current state. It learns a latent transition model and conducts planning in the latent space based on a graph neural network (GNN). Then, the next sub-task selected by the high level guides the low-level agent efficiently to solve long-horizon tasks and the multi-step return makes the low-level policy consider dependencies of future sub-tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the advantage of proposed framework over previous methods in terms of optimality and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Two common methods for training GNNs are mini-batch training and full-graph training. Since these two methods require different training pipelines and systems optimizations, two separate classes of GNN training systems emerged, each tailored for one method. Works that introduce systems belonging to a particular category predominantly compare them with other systems within the same category, offering limited or no comparison with systems from the other category. Some prior work also justifies its focus on one specific training method by arguing that it achieves higher accuracy than the alternative. The literature, however, has incomplete and contradictory evidence in this regard. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of representative full-graph and mini-batch GNN training systems. We find that the mini-batch training systems consistently converge faster than the full-graph training ones across multiple datasets, GNN models, and system configurations. We also find that mini-batch training techniques converge to similar or often higher accuracy values as full-graph training ones, showing that mini-batch sampling is not necessarily detrimental to accuracy. Our work highlights the importance of comparing systems across different classes, using time-to-accuracy rather than epoch time for performance comparison, and selecting appropriate hyperparameters for each training method separately.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 appendix, 8 Figures, 16 Tables, Graph Neural Network, Graph Neural Networks, Full-graph training, Mini-batch training, full-batch training, distributed training, performance, epoch time, time to accuracy, accuracy</p></details> |

This process involves determining the lowest energy across various adsorption configurations on a catalytic surface, which can exhibit very similar energy values. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in computing the energy of catalyst systems, they rely heavily on atomic spatial coordinates. In contrast, transformer-based language models can directly use human-readable text inputs, potentially bypassing the need for detailed atomic positions. However, these language models often struggle with accurately predicting the energy of adsorption configurations. Our study addresses this limitation by introducing a self-supervised multi-modal learning approach called graph-assisted pretraining, which connects well-established GNNs with emerging language model applications. This method reduces the MAE of energy prediction for adsorption configurations by about 10%. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that graph-assisted pretraining enhances fine-tuning with different datasets, indicating the transferability of this approach. This method also redirects the model's attention toward adsorption configuration, rather than individual adsorbate and catalyst information, similar to common domain knowledge. Building on this, we propose using generative large language models to create text inputs for the predictive model, based solely on chemical composition and surface orientation, without relying on exact atomic positions. This demonstrates a potential use case of language models in energy prediction without geometric information.</p></details> | manuscript updated |

The most flexible approach to constructing the sheaf is to learn it as part of the network as a function of the node features. However, this leaves the network potentially overly sensitive to the learned sheaf. As a counter-measure, we propose a variational approach to learning cellular sheaves within sheaf neural networks, yielding an architecture we refer to as a Bayesian sheaf neural network. As part of this work, we define a novel family of reparameterizable probability distributions on the rotation group $SO(n)$ using the Cayley transform. We evaluate the Bayesian sheaf neural network on several graph datasets, and show that our Bayesian sheaf models outperform deterministic sheaf models when training data is limited, and are less sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |

In the paper, we propose Graph Ensemble Temperature Scaling, a novel calibration framework that combines input and model ensemble strategies within a Graph Mixture of Experts archi SOTA calibration techniques, reducing expected calibration error by 25 percent across 10 GNN benchmark datasets. Additionally, GETS is computationally efficient, scalable, and capable of selecting effective input combinations for improved calibration performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for recommender systems, leveraging their ability to effectively capture complex relationships and dependencies between users and items by representing them as nodes in a graph structure. In this study, we investigate the environmental impact of GNN-based recommender systems, an aspect that has been largely overlooked in the literature. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the carbon emissions associated with training and deploying GNN models for recommendation tasks. We evaluate the energy consumption and carbon footprint of different GNN architectures and configurations, considering factors such as model complexity, training duration, hardware specifications and embedding size. By addressing the environmental impact of resource-intensive algorithms in recommender systems, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts towards sustainable and responsible artificial intelligence, promoting the development of eco-friendly recommendation technologies that balance performance and environmental considerations.

Previous works typically represent the graph using an external encoder, such as graph neural networks, and retrieve relevant triplets based on the similarity between single-vector representations of triplets and the dialog history. However, these external encoders fail to leverage the rich knowledge of pretrained language models, and the retrieval process is also suboptimal due to the information bottleneck caused by the single-vector abstraction of the dialog history. In this work, we propose Dialog generation with Generative Subgraph Retrieval (DialogGSR), which retrieves relevant knowledge subgraphs by directly generating their token sequences on top of language models. For effective generative subgraph retrieval, we introduce two key methods: (i) structure-aware knowledge graph linearization with self-supervised graph-specific tokens and (ii) graph-constrained decoding utilizing graph structural proximity-based entity informativeness scores for valid and relevant generative retrieval. DialogGSR achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge graph-grounded dialog generation, as demonstrated on OpenDialKG and KOMODIS datasets.</p></details> | EMNLP (main) |

While selecting highly confident nodes has proven effective for self-training, this pseudo-labeling strategy ignores the combinatorial dependencies between nodes and suffers from a local view of the distribution. To overcome these issues, we propose BANGS, a novel framework that unifies the labeling strategy with conditional mutual information as the objective of node selection. Our approach -- grounded in game theory -- selects nodes in a combinatorial fashion and provides theoretical guarantees for robustness under noisy objective. More specifically, unlike traditional methods that rank and select nodes independently, BANGS considers nodes as a collective set in the self-training process. Our method demonstrates superior performance and robustness across various datasets, base models, and hyperparameter settings, outperforming existing techniques.

Traditional time series classification methods often struggle with high computational complexity and inadequate capture of spatio-temporal dynamics. By representing time series as visibility graphs, it is possible to encode both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent to time series data, while being computationally efficient. Our architecture is fully modular, enabling flexible experimentation with different models and representations. We employ directed visibility graphs encoded with in-degree and PageRank features to improve the representation of time series, ensuring efficient computation while enhancing the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. We show the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed architecture across a diverse set of classification tasks and against a traditional model. Our work represents a significant advancement in the application of GNNs for time series analysis, offering a powerful and flexible framework for future research and practical implementations.</p></details> |  |

However, many complex systems--such as biological or social networks--involve multiway complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological spaces. The emerging field of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) aims to accommodate and leverage these higher-order structures. Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs), fairly general TDL models, have been shown to be more expressive and better performing than GNNs. However, differently from the graph deep learning ecosystem, TDL lacks a principled and standardized framework for easily defining new architectures, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a novel simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software that allows practitioners to define, build, and train GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Drug Effects from High-Dimensional, Asymmetric Drug Datasets by Using Graph Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multitarget Drug Effect Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09280v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as one of the most effective ML techniques for drug effect prediction from drug molecular graphs. Despite having immense potential, GNN models lack performance when using datasets that contain high-dimensional, asymmetrically co-occurrent drug effects as targets with complex correlations between them. Training individual learning models for each drug effect and incorporating every prediction result for a wide spectrum of drug effects are impractical. Therefore, an opportunity exists to address this challenge as multitarget prediction problems and predict all drug effects at a time. We developed standard and hybrid GNNs to perform two separate tasks: multiregression for continuous values and multilabel classification for categorical values contained in our datasets. Because multilabel classification makes the target data even more sparse and introduces asymmetric label co-occurrence, learning these models becomes difficult and heavily impacts the GNN's performance. To address these challenges, we propose a new data oversampling technique to improve multilabel classification performances on all the given imbalanced molecular graph datasets. Using the technique, we improve the data imbalance ratio of the drug effects while protecting the datasets' integrity. Finally, we evaluate the multilabel classification performance of the best-performing hybrid GNN model on all the oversampled datasets obtained from the proposed oversampling technique. In all the evaluation metrics (i.e., precision, recall, and F1 score), this model significantly outperforms other ML models, including GNN models when they are trained on the original datasets or oversampled datasets with MLSMOTE, which is a well-known oversampling technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 14 sub-figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

PolyGNN learns to assemble primitives obtained by polyhedral decomposition via graph node classification, achieving a watertight and compact reconstruction. To effectively represent arbitrary-shaped polyhedra in the neural network, we propose a skeleton-based sampling strategy to generate polyhedron-wise queries. These queries are then incorporated with inter-polyhedron adjacency to enhance the classification. PolyGNN is end-to-end optimizable and is designed to accommodate variable-size input points, polyhedra, and queries with an index-driven batching technique. To address the abstraction gap between existing city-building models and the underlying instances, and provide a fair evaluation of the proposed method, we develop our method on a large-scale synthetic dataset with well-defined ground truths of polyhedral labels. We further conduct a transferability analysis across cities and on real-world point clouds. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, particularly its efficiency for large-scale reconstructions.

Recently, machine learning-based classifiers using functional connectivity (FC) for psychiatric disorders and healthy controls are developed to identify brain markers. However, existing machine learning-based diagnostic models are prone to over-fitting (due to insufficient training samples) and perform poorly in new test environment. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain explainable and reliable brain biomarkers elucidating the underlying diagnostic decisions. These issues hinder their possible clinical applications. In this work, we propose BrainIB, a new graph neural network (GNN) framework to analyze functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), by leveraging the famed Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. BrainIB is able to identify the most informative edges in the brain (i.e., subgraph) and generalizes well to unseen data. We evaluate the performance of BrainIB against 3 baselines and 7 state-of-the-art brain network classification methods on three psychiatric datasets and observe that our BrainIB always achieves the highest diagnosis accuracy. It also discovers the subgraph biomarkers which are consistent to clinical and neuroimaging findings. The source code and implementation details of BrainIB are freely available at GitHub repository (https://github.com/SJYuCNEL/brain-and-Information-Bottleneck/).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), code is available at GitHub repository (https://github.com/SJYuCNEL/brain-and-Information-Bottleneck/)</p></details> |
| **[M$^3$-Impute: Mask-guided Representation Learning for Missing Value Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08794v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are a common problem that poses significant challenges to data analysis and machine learning. This problem necessitates the development of an effective imputation method to fill in the missing values accurately, thereby enhancing the overall quality and utility of the datasets. Existing imputation methods, however, fall short of explicitly considering the `missingness' information in the data during the embedding initialization stage and modeling the entangled feature and sample correlations during the learning process, thus leading to inferior performance. We propose M$^3$-Impute, which aims to explicitly leverage the missingness information and such correlations with novel masking schemes. M$^3$-Impute first models the data as a bipartite graph and uses a graph neural network to learn node embeddings, where the refined embedding initialization process directly incorporates the missingness information. They are then optimized through M$^3$-Impute's novel feature correlation unit (FRU) and sample correlation unit (SRU) that effectively captures feature and sample correlations for imputation. Experiment results on 25 benchmark datasets under three different missingness settings show the effectiveness of M$^3$-Impute by achieving 20 best and 4 second-best MAE scores on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Graph meets Multimodal: Benchmarking on Multimodal Attributed Graphs Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09132v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal attributed graphs (MAGs) are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and generally contain two kinds of knowledge: (a) Attribute knowledge is mainly supported by the attributes of different modalities contained in nodes (entities) themselves, such as texts and images. (b) Topology knowledge, on the other hand, is provided by the complex interactions posed between nodes. The cornerstone of MAG representation learning lies in the seamless integration of multimodal attributes and topology. Recent advancements in Pre-trained Language/Vision models (PLMs/PVMs) and Graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated effective learning on MAGs, garnering increased research interest. However, the absence of meaningful benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation procedures for MAG representation learning has impeded progress in this field. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Attribute Graph Benchmark (MAGB)}, a comprehensive and diverse collection of challenging benchmark datasets for MAGs. The MAGB datasets are notably large in scale and encompass a wide range of domains, spanning from e-commerce networks to social networks. In addition to the brand-new datasets, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments over MAGB with various learning paradigms, ranging from GNN-based and PLM-based methods, to explore the necessity and feasibility of integrating multimodal attributes and graph topology. In a nutshell, we provide an overview of the MAG datasets, standardized evaluation procedures, and present baseline experiments. The entire MAGB project is publicly accessible at https://github.com/sktsherlock/ATG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing GNNs with Architecture-Agnostic Graph Transformations: A Systematic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08759v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, a wide variety of graph neural network (GNN) architectures have emerged, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and complexities. Various techniques, including rewiring, lifting, and node annotation with centrality values, have been employed as pre-processing steps to enhance GNN performance. However, there are no universally accepted best practices, and the impact of architecture and pre-processing on performance often remains opaque. This study systematically explores the impact of various graph transformations as pre-processing steps on the performance of common GNN architectures across standard datasets. The models are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, referred to as expressivity. Our findings reveal that certain transformations, particularly those augmenting node features with centrality measures, consistently improve expressivity. However, these gains come with trade-offs, as methods like graph encoding, while enhancing expressivity, introduce numerical inaccuracies widely-used python packages. Additionally, we observe that these pre-processing techniques are limited when addressing complex tasks involving 3-WL and 4-WL indistinguishable graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Graph Learning Improve Planning in LLM-based Agents?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19119v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task planning in language agents is emerging as an important research topic alongside the development of large language models (LLMs). It aims to break down complex user requests in natural language into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests. In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them. Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design. Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs). This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance. The performance gain increases with a larger task graph size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Robot Planning and Perception through Environment Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08560v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots rely on maps to navigate through an environment. In the absence of any map, the robots must build the map online from partial observations as they move in the environment. Traditional methods build a map using only direct observations. In contrast, humans identify patterns in the observed environment and make informed guesses about what to expect ahead. Modeling these patterns explicitly is difficult due to the complexity of the environments. However, these complex models can be approximated well using learning-based methods in conjunction with large training data. By extracting patterns, robots can use direct observations and predictions of what lies ahead to better navigate an unknown environment. In this dissertation, we present several learning-based methods to equip mobile robots with prediction capabilities for efficient and safer operation. In the first part of the dissertation, we learn to predict using geometrical and structural patterns in the environment. Partially observed maps provide invaluable cues for accurately predicting the unobserved areas. We first demonstrate the capability of general learning-based approaches to model these patterns for a variety of overhead map modalities. Then we employ task-specific learning for faster navigation in indoor environments by predicting 2D occupancy in the nearby regions. This idea is further extended to 3D point cloud representation for object reconstruction. Predicting the shape of the full object from only partial views, our approach paves the way for efficient next-best-view planning. In the second part of the dissertation, we learn to predict using spatiotemporal patterns in the environment. We focus on dynamic tasks such as target tracking and coverage where we seek decentralized coordination between robots. We first show how graph neural networks can be used for more scalable and faster inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>289 p...</summary><p>289 pages, 81 figures, 16 tables; Dissertation submitted to UMD to fulfill PhD requirement</p></details> |
| **[IGNN-Solver: A Graph Neural Solver for Implicit Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08524v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit graph neural networks (IGNNs), which exhibit strong expressive power with a single layer, have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in capturing long-range dependencies (LRD) in underlying graphs while effectively mitigating the over-smoothing problem. However, IGNNs rely on computationally expensive fixed-point iterations, which lead to significant speed and scalability limitations, hindering their application to large-scale graphs. To achieve fast fixed-point solving for IGNNs, we propose a novel graph neural solver, IGNN-Solver, which leverages the generalized Anderson Acceleration method, parameterized by a small GNN, and learns iterative updates as a graph-dependent temporal process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IGNN-Solver significantly accelerates inference, achieving a $1.5\times$ to $8\times$ speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, this advantage becomes increasingly pronounced as the graph scale grows, facilitating its large-scale deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowGraph: Knowledge-Enabled Anomaly Detection via Logical Reasoning on Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08390v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based anomaly detection is pivotal in diverse security applications, such as fraud detection in transaction networks and intrusion detection for network traffic. Standard approaches, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), often struggle to generalize across shifting data distributions. Meanwhile, real-world domain knowledge is more stable and a common existing component of real-world detection strategies. To explicitly integrate such knowledge into data-driven models such as GCNs, we propose KnowGraph, which integrates domain knowledge with data-driven learning for enhanced graph-based anomaly detection. KnowGraph comprises two principal components: (1) a statistical learning component that utilizes a main model for the overarching detection task, augmented by multiple specialized knowledge models that predict domain-specific semantic entities; (2) a reasoning component that employs probabilistic graphical models to execute logical inferences based on model outputs, encoding domain knowledge through weighted first-order logic formulas. Extensive experiments on these large-scale real-world datasets show that KnowGraph consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both transductive and inductive settings, achieving substantial gains in average precision when generalizing to completely unseen test graphs. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning component in improving detection performance, especially under extreme class imbalance. These results highlight the potential of integrating domain knowledge into data-driven models for high-stakes, graph-based security applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CCS 2024</p></details> |
| **[FSW-GNN: A Bi-Lipschitz WL-Equivalent Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09118v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the most popular graph neural networks fall into the category of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs). Famously, MPNNs' ability to distinguish between graphs is limited to graphs separable by the Weisfeiler-Lemann (WL) graph isomorphism test, and the strongest MPNNs, in terms of separation power, are WL-equivalent. Recently, it was shown that the quality of separation provided by standard WL-equivalent MPNN can be very low, resulting in WL-separable graphs being mapped to very similar, hardly distinguishable features. This paper addresses this issue by seeking bi-Lipschitz continuity guarantees for MPNNs. We demonstrate that, in contrast with standard summation-based MPNNs, which lack bi-Lipschitz properties, our proposed model provides a bi-Lipschitz graph embedding with respect to two standard graph metrics. Empirically, we show that our MPNN is competitive with standard MPNNs for several graph learning tasks and is far more accurate in over-squashing long-range tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Auto-Encoder for CreditCard Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08121v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digital revolution has significantly impacted financial transactions, leading to a notable increase in credit card usage. However, this convenience comes with a trade-off: a substantial rise in fraudulent activities. Traditional machine learning methods for fraud detection often struggle to capture the inherent interconnectedness within financial data. This paper proposes a novel approach for credit card fraud detection that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms applied to heterogeneous graph representations of financial data. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs capture intricate relationships between various entities in the financial ecosystem, such as cardholders, merchants, and transactions, providing a richer and more comprehensive data representation for fraud analysis. To address the inherent class imbalance in fraud data, where genuine transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones, the proposed approach integrates an autoencoder. This autoencoder, trained on genuine transactions, learns a latent representation and flags deviations during reconstruction as potential fraud. This research investigates two key questions: (1) How effectively can a GNN with an attention mechanism detect and prevent credit card fraud when applied to a heterogeneous graph? (2) How does the efficacy of the autoencoder with attention approach compare to traditional methods? The results are promising, demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms benchmark algorithms such as Graph Sage and FI-GRL, achieving a superior AUC-PR of 0.89 and an F1-score of 0.81. This research significantly advances fraud detection systems and the overall security of financial transactions by leveraging GNNs with attention mechanisms and addressing class imbalance through an autoencoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks. EG-XC combines semi-local functionals with a non-local feature density parametrized by an equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud representation of the electron density to capture long-range interactions. By differentiating through a self-consistent field solver, we train EG-XC requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> |  |
