| **[Direct estimates of irreversibility from time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19772v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The arrow of time can be quantified through the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the distributions of forward and reverse trajectories in a system. Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use of incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a model-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence for irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on previous work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample size. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems that adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data generated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our method to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to naturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons, emphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new avenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Pretrained Embedding and Hierarchical Irregular Time Series Representation for Daily Living Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19732v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the evolving landscape of smart homes, the precise recognition of daily living activities using ambient sensor data stands paramount. This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Forget: Bayesian Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19727v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature kernel is a kernel between time series of arbitrary length and comes with strong theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. It has found applications in machine learning such as covariance functions for Gaussian processes. A strength of the underlying signature features is that they provide a structured global description of a time series. However, this property can quickly become a curse when local information is essential and forgetting is required; so far this has only been addressed with ad-hoc methods such as slicing the time series into subsegments. To overcome this, we propose a principled, data-driven approach by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism for signatures. This allows the model to dynamically adapt its context length to focus on more recent information. To achieve this, we revisit the recently introduced Random Fourier Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF) with Gaussian processes (GPs). This results in a Bayesian time series forecasting algorithm with variational inference, that offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm that processes and transforms a time series into a joint predictive distribution over time steps in one pass using recurrence. For example, processing a sequence of length $10^4$ steps in $\approx 10^{-2}$ seconds and in $< 1\text{GB}$ of GPU memory. We demonstrate that it outperforms other GP-based alternatives and competes with state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[Developing Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Based on Autoencoder-CNN-GANs Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18202v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze financial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

| **[A Time Series Analysis of Assertions in the Linux Kernel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19465v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assertions are a classical and typical software development technique. These are extensively used also in operating systems and their kernels, including the Linux kernel. The paper patches a gap in existing knowledge by empirically examining the longitudinal evolution of assertion use in the Linux kernel. According to the results, the use of assertions that cause a kernel panic has slightly but not substantially decreased from the kernel's third to the sixth release series. At the same time, however, the use of softer assertion variants has increased; these do not cause a panic by default but instead produce warnings. With these time series results, the paper contributes to the existing but limited empirical knowledge base about operating system kernels and their long-term evolution.</p></details> | Submitted |
| **[Revisiting PCA for time series reduction in temporal dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19423v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Revisiting PCA for Time Series Reduction in Temporal Dimension; Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen; Deep learning has significantly advanced time series analysis (TSA), enabling the extraction of complex patterns for tasks like classification, forecasting, and regression. Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards General Industrial Intelligence: A Survey of Continual Large Models in Industrial IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01207v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial AI is transitioning from traditional deep learning models to large-scale transformer-based architectures, with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) playing a pivotal role. IIoT evolves from a simple data pipeline to an intelligent infrastructure, enabling and enhancing these advanced AI systems. This survey explores the integration of IIoT with large models (LMs) and their potential applications in industrial environments. We focus on four primary types of industrial LMs: language-based, vision-based, time-series, and multimodal models. The lifecycle of LMs is segmented into four critical phases: data foundation, model training, model connectivity, and continuous evolution. First, we analyze how IIoT provides abundant and diverse data resources, supporting the training and fine-tuning of LMs. Second, we discuss how IIoT offers an efficient training infrastructure in low-latency and bandwidth-optimized environments. Third, we highlight the deployment advantages of LMs within IIoT, emphasizing IIoT's role as a connectivity nexus fostering emergent intelligence through modular design, dynamic routing, and model merging to enhance system scalability and adaptability. Finally, we demonstrate how IIoT supports continual learning mechanisms, enabling LMs to adapt to dynamic industrial conditions and ensure long-term effectiveness. This paper underscores IIoT's critical role in the evolution of industrial intelligence with large models, offering a theoretical framework and actionable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving High-dimensional Inverse Problems Using Amortized Likelihood-free Inference with Noisy and Incomplete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04565v2)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a likelihood-free probabilistic inversion method based on normalizing flows for high-dimensional inverse problems. The proposed method is composed of two complementary networks: a summary network for data compression and an inference network for parameter estimation. The summary network encodes raw observations into a fixed-size vector of summary features, while the inference network generates samples of the approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters based on these summary features. The posterior samples are produced in a deep generative fashion by sampling from a latent Gaussian distribution and passing these samples through an invertible transformation. We construct this invertible transformation by sequentially alternating conditional invertible neural network and conditional neural spline flow layers. The summary and inference networks are trained simultaneously. We apply the proposed method to an inversion problem in groundwater hydrology to estimate the posterior distribution of the log-conductivity field conditioned on spatially sparse time-series observations of the system's hydraulic head responses.The conductivity field is represented with 706 degrees of freedom in the considered problem.The comparison with the likelihood-based iterative ensemble smoother PEST-IES method demonstrates that the proposed method accurately estimates the parameter posterior distribution and the observations' predictive posterior distribution at a fraction of the inference time of PEST-IES.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Foundational Models: Their Role in Anomaly Detection and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19286v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundational models (TSFM) have gained prominence in time series forecasting, promising state-of-the-art performance across various applications. However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks. Additionally, TSFMs require high computational resources but fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively or improve performance in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. \noindent The preprocessed datasets, codes to reproduce the results and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/smtmnfg/TSFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Network double autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19251v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling high-dimensional time series with simple structures is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a network double autoregression (NDAR) model, which combines the advantages of network structure and the double autoregression (DAR) model, to handle high-dimensional, conditionally heteroscedastic, and network-structured data within a simple framework. The parameters of the model are estimated using quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, and the asymptotic properties of the estimators are derived. The selection of the model's lag order will be based on the Bayesian information criterion. Finite-sample simulations show that the proposed model performs well even with moderate time dimensions and network sizes. Finally, the model is applied to analyze three different categories of stock data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Mixture of Experts and Memory-augmented Routers for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19108v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is a critical task that involves identifying abnormal patterns or events in data that consist of multiple interrelated time series. In order to better model the complex interdependence between entities and the various inherent characteristics of each entity, the GNN based methods are widely adopted by existing methods. In each layer of GNN, node features aggregate information from their neighboring nodes to update their information. In doing so, from shallow layer to deep layer in GNN, original individual node features continue to be weakened and more structural information,i.e., from short-distance neighborhood to long-distance neighborhood, continues to be enhanced. However, research to date has largely ignored the understanding of how hierarchical graph information is represented and their characteristics that can benefit anomaly detection. Existing methods simply leverage the output from the last layer of GNN for anomaly estimation while neglecting the essential information contained in the intermediate GNN layers. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose a Graph Mixture of Experts (Graph-MoE) network for multivariate time series anomaly detection, which incorporates the mixture of experts (MoE) module to adaptively represent and integrate hierarchical multi-layer graph information into entity representations. It is worth noting that our Graph-MoE can be integrated into any GNN-based MTS anomaly detection method in a plug-and-play manner. In addition, the memory-augmented routers are proposed in this paper to capture the correlation temporal information in terms of the global historical features of MTS to adaptively weigh the obtained entity representations to achieve successful anomaly estimation. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets prove the superiority of our approach and each proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adopting Trustworthy AI for Sleep Disorder Prediction: Deep Time Series Analysis with Temporal Attention Mechanism and Counterfactual Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18971v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep disorders have a major impact on both lifestyle and health. Effective sleep disorder prediction from lifestyle and physiological data can provide essential details for early intervention. This research utilizes three deep time series models and facilitates them with explainability approaches for sleep disorder prediction. Specifically, our approach adopts Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time series data analysis, and Temporal Fusion Transformer model (TFT). Meanwhile, the temporal attention mechanism and counterfactual explanation with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach are employed to ensure dependable, accurate, and interpretable predictions. Finally, using a large dataset of sleep health measures, our evaluation demonstrates the effect of our method in predicting sleep disorders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stationary Processes, Wiener-Granger Causality, and Matrix Spectral Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18901v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Granger causality has become an indispensable tool for analyzing causal relationships between time series. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of its mathematical foundations, trace its historical development, and explore how recent computational advancements can enhance its application in various fields. We will not hesitate to present the proofs in full if they are simple and transparent. For more complex theorems on which we rely, we will provide supporting citations. We also discuss potential future directions for the method, particularly in the context of largescale data analysis.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Patch: Patch-Based MLP for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13575v3)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based MLP (PatchMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PatchMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ister: Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer for Explainable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18798v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-term time series forecasting, Transformer-based models have achieved great success, due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, existing transformer-based methods face challenges in accurately identifying which variables play a pivotal role in the prediction process and tend to overemphasize noisy channels, thereby limiting the interpretability and practical effectiveness of the models. Besides, it faces scalability issues due to quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this paper, we propose a new model named Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), which addresses these challenges in long-term multivariate time series forecasting by designing an improved Transformer-based structure. Ister firstly decomposes original time series into seasonal and trend components. Then we propose a new Dot-attention mechanism to process the seasonal component, which improves both accuracy, computation complexity and interpretability. Upon completion of the training phase, it allows users to intuitively visualize the significance of each feature in the overall prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that Ister achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, surpassing existing models in long-term prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Time Series of Networked Dynamical Systems without Knowing Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18734v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world complex systems, such as epidemic spreading networks and ecosystems, can be modeled as networked dynamical systems that produce multivariate time series. Learning the intrinsic dynamics from observational data is pivotal for forecasting system behaviors and making informed decisions. However, existing methods for modeling networked time series often assume known topologies, whereas real-world networks are typically incomplete or inaccurate, with missing or spurious links that hinder precise predictions. Moreover, while networked time series often originate from diverse topologies, the ability of models to generalize across topologies has not been systematically evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a novel framework for learning network dynamics directly from observed time-series data, when prior knowledge of graph topology or governing dynamical equations is absent. Our approach leverages continuous graph neural networks with an attention mechanism to construct a latent topology, enabling accurate reconstruction of future trajectories for network states. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate that our model not only captures dynamics effectively without topology knowledge but also generalizes to unseen time series originating from diverse topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGMA: Selective Gated Mamba for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11451v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various domains, Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) have become essential due to their superior capability to discern intricate user preferences. Typically, SRS utilize transformer-based architectures to forecast the subsequent item within a sequence. Nevertheless, the quadratic computational complexity inherent in these models often leads to inefficiencies, hindering the achievement of real-time recommendations. Mamba, a recent advancement, has exhibited exceptional performance in time series prediction, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. However, integrating Mamba directly into SRS poses several challenges. Its inherently unidirectional nature may constrain the model's capacity to capture the full context of user-item interactions, while its instability in state estimation can compromise its ability to detect short-term patterns within interaction sequences. To overcome these issues, we introduce a new framework named Selective Gated Mamba (SIGMA) for Sequential Recommendation. This framework leverages a Partially Flipped Mamba (PF-Mamba) to construct a bidirectional architecture specifically tailored to improve contextual modeling. Additionally, an input-sensitive Dense Selective Gate (DS Gate) is employed to optimize directional weights and enhance the processing of sequential information in PF-Mamba. For short sequence modeling, we have also developed a Feature Extract GRU (FE-GRU) to efficiently capture short-term dependencies. Empirical results indicate that SIGMA outperforms current models on five real-world datasets. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/ziwliu-cityu/SIMGA to ease reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subsampling, aligning, and averaging to find circular coordinates in recurrent time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18515v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new algorithm for finding robust circular coordinates on data that is expected to exhibit recurrence, such as that which appears in neuronal recordings of C. elegans. Techniques exist to create circular coordinates on a simplicial complex from a dimension 1 cohomology class, and these can be applied to the Rips complex of a dataset when it has a prominent class in its dimension 1 cohomology. However, it is known this approach is extremely sensitive to uneven sampling density. Our algorithm comes with a new method to correct for uneven sampling density, adapting our prior work on averaging coordinates in manifold learning. We use rejection sampling to correct for inhomogeneous sampling and then apply Procrustes matching to align and average the subsamples. In addition to providing a more robust coordinate than other approaches, this subsampling and averaging approach has better efficiency. We validate our technique on both synthetic data sets and neuronal activity recordings. Our results reveal a topological model of neuronal trajectories for C. elegans that is constructed from loops in which different regions of the brain state space can be mapped to specific and interpretable macroscopic behaviors in the worm.</p></details> |  |
| **[From CNN to CNN + RNN: Adapting Visualization Techniques for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04707v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are highly effective in solving complex problems but are often viewed as "black boxes," limiting their adoption in contexts where transparency and explainability are essential. This lack of visibility raises ethical and legal concerns, particularly in critical areas like security, where automated decisions can have significant consequences. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) underscores the importance of justifying these decisions. In this work, we explore visualization techniques to improve the understanding of anomaly detection models based on convolutional recurrent neural networks (CNN + RNN) with a TimeDistributed layer. Our model combines VGG19 for convolutional feature extraction and a GRU layer for sequential analysis of real-time video data. While suitable for temporal data, this structure complicates gradient propagation, as sequence elements are processed independently, dissociating temporal information. We adapt visualization techniques such as saliency maps and Grad-CAM to address these challenges. This article highlights the difficulties in visually interpreting video-based models and demonstrates how techniques for static images can be adapted to recurrent architectures, offering a transitional solution in the absence of dedicated methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to explore the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCKF-LSTM Based Trajectory Tracking for Electricity-Gas Integrated Energy System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18357v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach for tracking the dynamic trajectories of integrated natural gas and power systems, leveraging a Kalman filter-based structure. To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18975v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly advanced time series forecasting through its powerful capacity to capture sequence relationships. However, training these models with the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss often results in over-smooth predictions, making it challenging to handle the complexity and learn high-entropy features from time series data with high variability and unpredictability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing time series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while considering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic component that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a Hierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy features at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label for timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier mitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also implement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency across hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines on several real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Conditioning of Score-Based Diffusion Models by Neuro-Symbolic Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16534v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have emerged as effective approaches for both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when a classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose a method that, given a pre-trained unconditional score-based generative model, samples from the conditional distribution under arbitrary logical constraints, without requiring additional training. Differently from other zero-shot techniques, that rather aim at generating valid conditional samples, our method is designed for approximating the true conditional distribution. Firstly, we show how to manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach in approximating conditional distributions for various types of constraints and data: tabular data, images and time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable AI for Multivariate Time Series Pattern Exploration: Latent Space Visual Analytics with Temporal Fusion Transformer and Variational Autoencoders in Power Grid Event Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16098v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations. However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models, lacking AI-assisted automation, rely on experts, incur high costs, and struggle with sparse data prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Energy Forecasting Large Language Model (EF-LLM), which integrates domain knowledge and temporal data for time-series forecasting, supporting both pre-forecast operations and post-forecast decision-support. EF-LLM's human-AI interaction capabilities lower the entry barrier in forecasting tasks, reducing the need for extra expert involvement. To achieve this, we propose a continual learning approach with updatable LoRA and a multi-channel architecture for aligning heterogeneous multimodal data, enabling EF-LLM to continually learn heterogeneous multimodal knowledge. In addition, EF-LLM enables accurate predictions under sparse data conditions through its ability to process multimodal data. We propose Fusion Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (F-PEFT) method to effectively leverage both time-series data and text for this purpose. EF-LLM is also the first energy-specific LLM to detect hallucinations and quantify their occurrence rate, achieved via multi-task learning, semantic similarity analysis, and ANOVA. We have achieved success in energy prediction scenarios for load, photovoltaic, and wind power forecast.</p></details> |  |

Recent works proposed a microarchitecture framework and custom macro suite for designing highly energy-efficient application-specific TNNs. These recent works rely on manual hardware design, a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Further, there is no open-source functional simulation framework for TNNs. This paper introduces TNNGen, a pioneering effort towards the automated design of TNNs from PyTorch software models to post-layout netlists. TNNGen comprises a novel PyTorch functional simulator (for TNN modeling and application exploration) coupled with a Python-based hardware generator (for PyTorch-to-RTL and RTL-to-Layout conversions). Seven representative TNN designs for time-series signal clustering across diverse sensory modalities are simulated and their post-layout hardware complexity and design runtimes are assessed to demonstrate the effectiveness of TNNGen. We also highlight TNNGen's ability to accurately forecast silicon metrics without running hardware process flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, May 2024</p></details> |

However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[VITRO: Vocabulary Inversion for Time-series Representation Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17921v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating textual data, their pre-trained vocabularies are ill-suited for capturing the nuanced temporal dynamics and patterns inherent in time series. The discrete, symbolic nature of natural language tokens, which these vocabularies are designed to represent, does not align well with the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose VITRO. Our method adapts textual inversion optimization from the vision-language domain in order to learn a new time series per-dataset vocabulary that bridges the gap between the discrete, semantic nature of natural language and the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. We show that learnable time series-specific pseudo-word embeddings represent time series data better than existing general language model vocabularies, with VITRO-enhanced methods achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across most datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Optimization of Singular Spectrum Analyses: A Pragmatic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17793v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) occupies a prominent place in the real signal analysis toolkit alongside Fourier and Wavelet analysis. In addition to the two aforementioned analyses, SSA allows the separation of patterns directly from the data space into the data space, with data that need not be strictly stationary, continuous, or even normally sampled. In most cases, SSA relies on a combination of Hankel or Toeplitz matrices and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Like Fourier and Wavelet analysis, SSA has its limitations. The main bottleneck of the method can be summarized in three points. The first is the diagonalization of the Hankel/Toeplitz matrix, which can become a major problem from a memory and/or computational point of view if the time series to be analyzed is very long or heavily sampled. The second point concerns the size of the analysis window, typically denoted as 'L', which will affect the detection of patterns in the time series as well as the dimensions of the Hankel/Toeplitz matrix. Finally, the third point concerns pattern reconstruction: how to easily identify in the eigenvector/eigenvalue space which patterns should be grouped. We propose to address each of these issues by describing a hopefully effective approach that we have been developing for over 10 years and that has yielded good results in our research work.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Ergodic Network Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17779v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for Network Stochastic Differential Equations (N-SDE), where each node in a network is governed by an SDE influenced by interactions with its neighbors. The evolution of each node is driven by the interplay of three key components: the node's intrinsic dynamics (\emph{momentum effect}), feedback from neighboring nodes (\emph{network effect}), and a \emph{stochastic volatility} term modeled by Brownian motion. Our primary objective is to estimate the parameters of the N-SDE system from high-frequency discrete-time observations. The motivation behind this model lies in its ability to analyze very high-dimensional time series by leveraging the inherent sparsity of the underlying network graph. We consider two distinct scenarios: \textit{i) known network structure}: the graph is fully specified, and we establish conditions under which the parameters can be identified, considering the quadratic growth of the parameter space with the number of edges. \textit{ii) unknown network structure}: the graph must be inferred from the data. For this, we develop an iterative procedure using adaptive Lasso, tailored to a specific subclass of N-SDE models. In this work, we assume the network graph is oriented, paving the way for novel applications of SDEs in causal inference, enabling the study of cause-effect relationships in dynamic systems. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the performance of our estimators across various graph topologies in high-dimensional settings. We also showcase the framework's applicability to real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing the analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> |  |

EasyTime, the system we demonstrate, facilitates easy use of time-series forecasting methods by researchers and practitioners alike. First, EasyTime enables one-click evaluation, enabling researchers to evaluate new forecasting methods using the suite of diverse time series datasets collected in the preexisting time series forecasting benchmark (TFB). This is achieved by leveraging TFB's flexible and consistent evaluation pipeline. Second, when practitioners must perform forecasting on a new dataset, a nontrivial first step is often to find an appropriate forecasting method. EasyTime provides an Automated Ensemble module that combines the promising forecasting methods to yield superior forecasting accuracy compared to individual methods. Third, EasyTime offers a natural language Q&A module leveraging large language models. Given a question like "Which method is best for long term forecasting on time series with strong seasonality?", EasyTime converts the question into SQL queries on the database of results obtained by TFB and then returns an answer in natural language and charts. By demonstrating EasyTime, we intend to show how it is possible to simplify the use of time series forecasting and to offer better support for the development of new generations of time series forecasting methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2025 |

A crucial step of it is parameter optimization, which is typically tackled through gradient-descent techniques. We advantageously explore instead the use of evolutionary algorithms for such optimization, specifically for time-series forecasting. We perform a comparison, for diverse instances of real-world data, between gradient-descent parameter optimization and covariant-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. We observe that gradient descent becomes permanently trapped in local minima that have been avoided by evolutionary algorithms in all tested datasets, reaching up to a six-fold decrease in prediction error. Finally, the combined use of evolutionary and gradient-based techniques is explored, aiming at retaining advantages of both. The results are particularly applicable in scenarios sensitive to gains in accuracy.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Are Self-Attentions Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16877v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial for applications across multiple domains and various scenarios. Although Transformer models have dramatically advanced the landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated. Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures. In this paper, we shift the focus from evaluating the overall Transformer architecture to specifically examining the effectiveness of self-attention for time series forecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage. Extensive experiment across various datasets demonstrates that our model achieves superior performance with the lowest mean squared error and uses fewer parameters compared to existing models.

| **[Data-Driven Tuning Parameter Selection for High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06657v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lasso-type estimators are routinely used to estimate high-dimensional time series models. The theoretical guarantees established for these estimators typically require the penalty level to be chosen in a suitable fashion often depending on unknown population quantities. Furthermore, the resulting estimates and the number of variables retained in the model depend crucially on the chosen penalty level. However, there is currently no theoretically founded guidance for this choice in the context of high-dimensional time series. Instead, one resorts to selecting the penalty level in an ad hoc manner using, e.g., information criteria or cross-validation. We resolve this problem by considering estimation of the perhaps most commonly employed multivariate time series model, the linear vector autoregressive (VAR) model, and propose versions of the Lasso, post-Lasso, and square-root Lasso estimators with penalization chosen in a fully data-driven way. The theoretical guarantees that we establish for the resulting estimation and prediction errors match those currently available for methods based on infeasible choices of penalization. We thus provide a first solution for choosing the penalization in high-dimensional time series models.</p></details> | 90 pages, 5 figures |

However, they systematically underestimate the noise level inherent in such data, limiting their ability to capture stochastic dynamics accurately. We investigate this underestimation in detail and propose a straightforward solution: by including an explicit additional noise regularization in the loss function, we are able to learn a model that accurately captures the diffusion component of the data. We demonstrate our results on a conceptual model system that highlights the improved latent neural SDE's capability to model stochastic bistable dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |

Despite their importance, detailed spatial data on the global agricultural workforce have remained scarce. Here, we present a new gridded dataset that maps the global distribution of agricultural workers for every decade over the years 2000-2100, distributed at 0.083$\times$0.083 degrees resolution, roughly $\sim$10km$\times$10km at the Equator. The dataset is developed using an empirical modeling framework relying on generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) that integrate socioeconomic variables, including gross domestic product per capita, total population, rural population size, and agricultural land use. The predictions are consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways and we distribute full time series data for all SSPs 1 to 5. This dataset opens new avenues for future research on labour force health, productivity and risk, and could be very useful for developing informed, forward-looking strategies that address the challenges of climate resilience in agriculture.

The two primary tasks for high-dimensional time series analysis are modeling and statistical inference, which aim to capture the underlying dynamic structure and investigate valuable information in the data. This paper presents the HDTSA package for R, which provides a general framework for analyzing high-dimensional time series data. This package includes four dimension reduction methods for modeling: factor models, principal component analysis, CP-decomposition, and cointegration analysis. It also implements two recently proposed white noise test and martingale difference test in high-dimensional scenario for statistical inference. The methods provided in this package can help users to analyze high-dimensional time series data and make reliable predictions.

While often demonstrating promising results, the transformer architecture encounters challenges in fully exploiting the temporal relations within time series data due to its attention mechanism. In this work, we design eXponential Patch (xPatch for short), a novel dual-stream architecture that utilizes exponential decomposition. Inspired by the classical exponential smoothing approaches, xPatch introduces the innovative seasonal-trend exponential decomposition module. Additionally, we propose a dual-flow architecture that consists of an MLP-based linear stream and a CNN-based non-linear stream. This model investigates the benefits of employing patching and channel-independence techniques within a non-transformer model. Finally, we develop a robust arctangent loss function and a sigmoid learning rate adjustment scheme, which prevent overfitting and boost forecasting performance.

Financial data usually has the complex characteristics of high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and time series, and is accompanied by potential correlations between multiple tasks, making it difficult for traditional methods to meet the needs of data mining. This study introduces the ResNeXt model into the multi-task learning framework and makes full use of its group convolution mechanism to achieve efficient extraction of local patterns and global features of financial data. At the same time, through the design of task sharing layers and dedicated layers, it is established between multiple related tasks. Deep collaborative optimization relationships. Through flexible multi-task loss weight design, the model can effectively balance the learning needs of different tasks and improve overall performance. Experiments are conducted on a real S&P 500 financial data set, verifying the significant advantages of the proposed framework in classification and regression tasks. The results indicate that, when compared to other conventional deep learning models, the proposed method delivers superior performance in terms of accuracy, F1 score, root mean square error, and other metrics, highlighting its outstanding effectiveness and robustness in handling complex financial data. This research provides an efficient and adaptable solution for financial data mining, and at the same time opens up a new research direction for the combination of multi-task learning and deep learning, which has important theoretical significance and practical application value.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a multi-scale hypergraph is introduced to provide foundations for modeling high-order pattern interactions. Then by treating hyperedges as nodes, we also build a hyperedge graph to enhance hypergraph modeling. In addition, a tri-stage message passing mechanism is introduced to aggregate pattern information and learn the interaction strength between temporal patterns of different scales.

We find that VLMs produce competitive results after two or less epochs of fine-tuning. We develop a novel approach that incorporates graphical data representations as images in conjunction with numerical data. This approach is rooted in the hypothesis that graphical representations can provide additional contextual information that numerical data alone may not capture. Additionally, providing a graphical representation can circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further advance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training on different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies for transferring learning capabilities from LLMs to Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks. Our approach works with univariate and multivariate time-series data. In addition, we conduct extensive and practical experiments to show how this approach works for time-series classification and generative labels.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically model the evolution of learning curves in isolation, neglecting the impact of neural network (NN) architectures, which influence the loss landscape and learning trajectories. In this work, we explore whether incorporating neural network architecture improves learning curve modeling and how to effectively integrate this architectural information. Motivated by the dynamical system view of optimization, we propose a novel architecture-aware neural differential equation model to forecast learning curves continuously. We empirically demonstrate its ability to capture the general trend of fluctuating learning curves while quantifying uncertainty through variational parameters. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art learning curve extrapolation methods and pure time-series modeling approaches for both MLP and CNN-based learning curves.

| **[DUET: Dual Clustering Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10859v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as financial investment, energy management, weather forecasting, and traffic optimization. However, accurate forecasting is challenging due to two main factors. First, real-world time series often show heterogeneous temporal patterns caused by distribution shifts over time. Second, correlations among channels are complex and intertwined, making it hard to model the interactions among channels precisely and flexibly. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a general framework called DUET, which introduces dual clustering on the temporal and channel dimensions to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. First, we design a Temporal Clustering Module (TCM) that clusters time series into fine-grained distributions to handle heterogeneous temporal patterns. For different distribution clusters, we design various pattern extractors to capture their intrinsic temporal patterns, thus modeling the heterogeneity. Second, we introduce a novel Channel-Soft-Clustering strategy and design a Channel Clustering Module (CCM), which captures the relationships among channels in the frequency domain through metric learning and applies sparsification to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy channels. Finally, DUET combines TCM and CCM to incorporate both the temporal and channel dimensions. Extensive experiments on 25 real-world datasets from 10 application domains, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DUET.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

In recent studies, MLP-mixer models for time series forecasting have been shown as a promising alternative to transformer-based models. However, the performance of these models is still yet to reach its potential. In this paper, we propose Wavelet Patch Mixer (WPMixer), a novel MLP-based model, for long-term time series forecasting, which leverages the benefits of patching, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and mixing. Our model is based on three key components: (i) multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, (ii) patching and embedding, and (iii) MLP mixing. Multi-resolution wavelet decomposition efficiently extracts information in both the frequency and time domains. Patching allows the model to capture an extended history with a look-back window and enhances capturing local information while MLP mixing incorporates global information. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLP-based and transformer-based models for long-term time series forecasting in a computationally efficient way, demonstrating its efficacy and potential for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 Figures, AAAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[Spline Autoregression Method for Estimation of Quantile Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17163v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantile spectrum was introduced in Li (2012; 2014) as an alternative tool for spectral analysis of time series. It has the capability of providing a richer view of time series data than that offered by the ordinary spectrum especially for nonlinear dynamics such as stochastic volatility. A novel method, called spline autoregression (SAR), is proposed in this paper for estimating the quantile spectrum as a bivaraite function of frequency and quantile level, under the assumption that the quantile spectrum varies smoothly with the quantile level. The SAR method is facilitated by the quantile discrete Fourier transform (QDFT) based on trigonometric quantile regression. It is enabled by the resulting time-domain quantile series (QSER) which represents properly scaled oscillatory characteristics of the original time series around a quantile. A functional autoregressive (AR) model is fitted to the QSER on a grid of quantile levels by penalized least-squares with the AR coefficients represented as smoothing splines of the quantile level. While the ordinary AR model is widely used for conventional spectral estimation, the proposed SAR method provides an effective way of estimating the quantile spectrum as a bivariate function in comparison with the alternatives. This is confirmed by a simulation study.</p></details> |  |

Our method performs front and rear background segmentation of point clouds through a global-local sequence clusterer and parses point cloud data from both the spatial-temporal density and spatial-temporal voxels of the point cloud. Furthermore, a scoring mechanism for point cloud moving targets is proposed, using time series detection to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Despite the advancements in supply chain relationship datasets like Bloomberg and FactSet, supply chain transparency remains a significant challenge in emerging economies due to issues such as information asymmetry and institutional gaps in regulation. This study proposes a novel approach to enhance supply chain transparency in emerging economies by leveraging online content and large language models (LLMs). We develop a Supply Chain Knowledge Graph Mining System that integrates advanced LLMs with web crawler technology to automatically collect and analyze supply chain information.

| **[Preventing Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Privacy Invasion: A Precise Adversarial Attack Scheme for Networked Smart Meters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16893v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart grid, through networked smart meters employing the non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique, can considerably discern the usage patterns of residential appliances. However, this technique also incurs privacy leakage. To address this issue, we propose an innovative scheme based on adversarial attack in this paper. The scheme effectively prevents NILM models from violating appliance-level privacy, while also ensuring accurate billing calculation for users. To achieve this objective, we overcome two primary challenges. First, as NILM models fall under the category of time-series regression models, direct application of traditional adversarial attacks designed for classification tasks is not feasible. To tackle this issue, we formulate a novel adversarial attack problem tailored specifically for NILM and providing a theoretical foundation for utilizing the Jacobian of the NILM model to generate imperceptible perturbations. Leveraging the Jacobian, our scheme can produce perturbations, which effectively misleads the signal prediction of NILM models to safeguard users' appliance-level privacy. The second challenge pertains to fundamental utility requirements, where existing adversarial attack schemes struggle to achieve accurate billing calculation for users. To handle this problem, we introduce an additional constraint, mandating that the sum of added perturbations within a billing period must be precisely zero. Experimental validation on real-world power datasets REDD and UK-DALE demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed solutions, which can significantly amplify the discrepancy between the output of the targeted NILM model and the actual power signal of appliances, and enable accurate billing at the same time. Additionally, our solutions exhibit transferability, making the generated perturbation signal from one target model applicable to other diverse NILM models.</p></details> |  |

Many of these applications present a natural hierarchical structure over the forecasted quantities; and forecasting systems that adhere to this hierarchical structure are said to be coherent. Furthermore, operational planning benefits from the accuracy at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. However, building accurate and coherent forecasting systems is challenging: classic multivariate time series tools and neural network methods are still being adapted for this purpose. In this paper, we augment an MQForecaster neural network architecture with a modified multivariate Gaussian factor model that achieves coherence by construction. The factor model samples can be differentiated with respect to the model parameters, allowing optimization on arbitrary differentiable learning objectives that align with the forecasting system's goals, including quantile loss and the scaled Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). We call our method the Coherent Learning Objective Reparametrization Neural Network (CLOVER). In comparison to state-of-the-art coherent forecasting methods, CLOVER achieves significant improvements in scaled CRPS forecast accuracy, with average gains of 15%, as measured on six publicly-available datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages of main text.

In view of these challenges, we propose TimeRAG, a framework that incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into time series forecasting LLMs, which constructs a time series knowledge base from historical sequences, retrieves reference sequences from the knowledge base that exhibit similar patterns to the query sequence measured by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and combines these reference sequences and the prediction query as a textual prompt to the time series forecasting LLM. Experiments on datasets from various domains show that the integration of RAG improved the prediction accuracy of the original model by 2.97% on average.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods based on time series analysis often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital.

Despite recent advancements leveraging large language models (LLMs), existing methods often struggle with pattern recognition, context drift in long time-series data, and the lack of visual-based reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose VisTR, a framework that places visualizations at the core of the reasoning process. Specifically, VisTR leverages visualizations as representations to bridge raw time-series data and human cognitive processes. By transforming tables into fixed-size visualization references, it captures key trends, anomalies, and temporal relationships, facilitating intuitive and interpretable reasoning. These visualizations are aligned with user input, i.e., charts, text, and sketches, through a fine-tuned multimodal LLM, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. To handle large-scale data, VisTR integrates pruning and indexing mechanisms for scalable and efficient retrieval. Finally, an interactive visualization interface supports seamless multimodal exploration, enabling users to interact with data through both textual and visual modalities. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of VisTR in aligning multimodal inputs and improving reasoning accuracy. Case studies further illustrate its applicability to various time-series reasoning and exploration tasks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Breaking the Context Bottleneck on Long Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16572v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting is essential for planning and decision-making in economics, energy, and transportation, where long foresight is required. To obtain such long foresight, models must be both efficient and effective in processing long sequence. Recent advancements have enhanced the efficiency of these models; however, the challenge of effectively leveraging longer sequences persists. This is primarily due to the tendency of these models to overfit when presented with extended inputs, necessitating the use of shorter input lengths to maintain tolerable error margins. In this work, we investigate the multiscale modeling method and propose the Logsparse Decomposable Multiscaling (LDM) framework for the efficient and effective processing of long sequences. We demonstrate that by decoupling patterns at different scales in time series, we can enhance predictability by reducing non-stationarity, improve efficiency through a compact long input representation, and simplify the architecture by providing clear task assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that LDM not only outperforms all baselines in long-term forecasting benchmarks, but also reducing both training time and memory costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Time ...</summary><p>Time series forecasting algorithm based on multi-scale analysis</p></details> |

While many existing methods focus on discovering discriminative patterns in time series, real-world data does not always present such patterns, and sometimes raw numerical values can also serve as discriminative features. Additionally, the recent success of Transformer models has inspired many studies. However, when applying to time series classification, the self-attention mechanisms in Transformer models could introduce classification-irrelevant features, thereby compromising accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, VSFormer, that incorporates both discriminative patterns (shape) and numerical information (value). In addition, we extract class-specific prior information derived from supervised information to enrich the positional encoding and provide classification-oriented self-attention learning, thereby enhancing its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on all 30 UEA archived datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to SOTA models. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved encoding layer and the proposed self-attention mechanism. Finally, We provide a case study on a real-world time series dataset without discriminative patterns to interpret our model.</p></details> |  |

However, the main bottleneck of existing approaches is the lack of supervision on the generator training, which often results in undamped oscillation and unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called Monte Carlo GAN (MCGAN). This approach, utilizing an innovative generative loss function, termly the regression loss, reformulates the generator training as a regression task and enables the generator training by minimizing the mean squared error between the discriminator's output of real data and the expected discriminator of fake data. We demonstrate the desirable analytic properties of the regression loss, including discriminability and optimality, and show that our method requires a weaker condition on the discriminator for effective generator training. These properties justify the strength of this approach to improve the training stability while retaining the optimality of GAN by leveraging strong supervision of the regression loss. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including image data (CIFAR-10/100, FFHQ256, ImageNet, and LSUN Bedroom), time series data (VAR and stock data) and video data, are conducted to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed MCGAN. Numerical results show that the proposed MCGAN is versatile in enhancing a variety of backbone GAN models and achieves consistent and significant improvement in terms of quality, accuracy, training stability, and learned latent space.</p></details> |  |

However, these time-series data often contain spikes, steps, and drifts that degrade data quality and obscure essential oceanographic features. To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative Encoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs) model to improve the quality of DART time series. Unlike traditional filtering and thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics, Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while preserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further retains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART datasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic properties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved robustness against spike removal and subtle step changes. The resulting high-quality data supports critical verification and validation efforts for the GRACE-FO mission at NASA-JPL, where accurate surface measurements are essential to modeling Earth's gravitational field and global water dynamics. Ultimately, this data processing method enhances tsunami detection and underpins future climate modeling with improved interpretability and reliability.</p></details> | Preprint |

Accurate RUL estimation plays a crucial role in Predictive Maintenance applications. Traditional regression methods, both linear and non-linear, have struggled to achieve high accuracy in this domain. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown improved accuracy, they often overlook the sequential nature of the data, relying instead on features derived from sliding windows. Since RUL prediction inherently involves multivariate time series analysis, robust sequence learning is essential. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for RUL estimation. Although CNN-based LSTM models have been applied to sequence prediction tasks in financial forecasting, this is the first attempt to adopt this approach for RUL estimation in prognostics. In this approach, CNN is first employed to efficiently extract features from the data, followed by LSTM, which uses these extracted features to predict RUL. This method effectively leverages sensor sequence information, uncovering hidden patterns within the data, even under multiple operating conditions and fault scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieves the highest accuracy, offering a superior score compared to the other methods.</p></details> | conference paper |
| **[Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\chi_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $\chi_{\rm max} = 20-150$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data. By sampling from the joint probability distribution and calculating its conditional entanglement entropy, we show how its underlying structure can be uncovered and interpreted. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The efficiency of the MPS-based ansatz for learning complex correlation structures from time-series data is likely to underpin interpretable advances to challenging time-series ML problems across science, industry, and medicine.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Learned Compression of Nonlinear Time Series With Random Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16266v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series play a crucial role in many fields, including finance, healthcare, industry, and environmental monitoring. The storage and retrieval of time series can be challenging due to their unstoppable growth. In fact, these applications often sacrifice precious historical data to make room for new data. General-purpose compressors can mitigate this problem with their good compression ratios, but they lack efficient random access on compressed data, thus preventing real-time analyses. Ad-hoc streaming solutions, instead, typically optimise only for compression and decompression speed, while giving up compression effectiveness and random access functionality. Furthermore, all these methods lack awareness of certain special regularities of time series, whose trends over time can often be described by some linear and nonlinear functions. To address these issues, we introduce NeaTS, a randomly-accessible compression scheme that approximates the time series with a sequence of nonlinear functions of different kinds and shapes, carefully selected and placed by a partitioning algorithm to minimise the space. The approximation residuals are bounded, which allows storing them in little space and thus recovering the original data losslessly, or simply discarding them to obtain a lossy time series representation with maximum error guarantees. Our experiments show that NeaTS improves the compression ratio of the state-of-the-art lossy compressors that use linear or nonlinear functions (or both) by up to 14%. Compared to lossless compressors, NeaTS emerges as the only approach to date providing, simultaneously, compression ratios close to or better than the best existing compressors, a much faster decompression speed, and orders of magnitude more efficient random access, thus enabling the storage and real-time analysis of massive and ever-growing amounts of (historical) time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proceedings of the 41st IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2025)</p></details> |

While causal inference methods have been extensively studied, they often rely on fully specified causal graphs, which may not always be available in complex dynamic systems. Partially specified causal graphs, and in particular summary causal graphs (SCGs), provide a simplified representation of causal relations between time series when working spacio-temporal data, omitting temporal information and focusing on causal structures between clusters of of temporal variables. Unlike fully specified causal graphs, SCGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and interpretation. In addition, their cluster-based nature introduces new challenges concerning the types of queries of interest: macro queries, which involve relationships between clusters represented as vertices in the graph, and micro queries, which pertain to relationships between variables that are not directly visible through the vertices of the graph. In this paper, we first clearly distinguish between macro conditional independencies and micro conditional independencies and between macro total effects and micro total effects. Then, we demonstrate the soundness and completeness of the d-separation to identify macro conditional independencies in SCGs. Furthermore, we establish that the do-calculus is sound and complete for identifying macro total effects in SCGs. Finally, we give a graphical characterization for the non-identifiability of macro total effects in SCGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted CI4TS Workshop at UAI2024.

However, its perturbation-based privacy mechanism makes it difficult to distinguish between uncontaminated and tainted data, encouraging adversaries to launch poisoning attacks. While LDP provides some resilience against minor poisoning, it lacks robustness in IIoT with dynamic networks and substantial real-time data flows. Effective countermeasures for such attacks are still underdeveloped. This work narrows the critical gap by revealing and identifying LDP poisoning attacks in IIoT. We begin by deepening the understanding of such attacks, revealing novel threats that arise from the interplay between LDP indistinguishability and IIoT complexity. This exploration uncovers a novel rule-poisoning attack, and presents a general attack formulation by unifying it with input-poisoning and output-poisoning. Furthermore, two key attack impacts, i.e., Statistical Query Result (SQR) accuracy degradation and inter-dataset correlations disruption, along with two characteristics: attack patterns unstable and poisoned data stealth are revealed. From this, we propose PoisonCatcher, a four-stage solution that detects LDP poisoning attacks and identifies specific contaminated data points. It utilizes temporal similarity, attribute correlation, and time-series stability analysis to detect datasets exhibiting SQR accuracy degradation, inter-dataset disruptions, and unstable patterns. Enhanced feature engineering is used to extract subtle poisoning signatures, enabling machine learning models to identify specific contamination. Experimental evaluations show the effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with average precision and recall rates of 86.17% and 97.5%, respectively, across six representative attack scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

While machine learning-based approaches have shown promise in enhancing these forecasts, they often remain confined to the specific markets on which they are trained, thereby limiting their adaptability to new or unseen markets. In this paper, we introduce a cross-domain adaptation model designed to forecast energy prices by learning market-invariant representations across different markets during the training phase. We propose a doubly residual N-BEATS network with Kolmogorov Arnold networks at its core for time series forecasting. These networks, grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a powerful way to approximate multivariate continuous functions. The cross domain adaptation model was generated with an adversarial framework. The model's effectiveness was tested in predicting day-ahead electricity prices in a zero shot fashion. In comparison with baseline models, our proposed framework shows promising results. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, our model can potentially enhance its ability to capture complex patterns in energy price data, thus improving forecast accuracy across diverse market conditions. This addition not only enriches the model's representational capacity but also contributes to a more robust and flexible forecasting tool adaptable to various energy markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published In: 2024 NeurIPS Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models</p></details> |

Granger causality is a powerful tool for causality detection. However, its original formulation is limited by its linear form and only recently nonlinear machine-learning generalizations have been introduced. This study contributes to the definition of neural Granger causality models by investigating the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in Granger causality detection and comparing their capabilities against multilayer perceptrons (MLP). In this work, we develop a framework called Granger Causality KAN (GC-KAN) along with a tailored training approach designed specifically for Granger causality detection. We test this framework on both Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models and chaotic Lorenz-96 systems, analysing the ability of KANs to sparsify input features by identifying Granger causal relationships, providing a concise yet accurate model for Granger causality detection. Our findings show the potential of KANs to outperform MLPs in discerning interpretable Granger causal relationships, particularly for the ability of identifying sparse Granger causality patterns in high-dimensional settings, and more generally, the potential of AI in causality discovery for the dynamical laws in physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Under climate change, accurately predicting drought is critical for mitigating drought-induced risks. However, the intricate interplay among the physical and biological drivers that regulate droughts limits the predictability and understanding of drought, particularly at a subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scale. While deep learning has been demonstrated with potential in addressing climate forecasting challenges, its application to drought prediction has received relatively less attention. In this work, we propose a new dataset, DroughtSet, which integrates relevant predictive features and three drought indices from multiple remote sensing and reanalysis datasets across the contiguous United States (CONUS). DroughtSet specifically provides the machine learning community with a new real-world dataset to benchmark drought prediction models and more generally, time-series forecasting methods. Furthermore, we propose a spatial-temporal model SPDrought to predict and interpret S2S droughts. Our model learns from the spatial and temporal information of physical and biological features to predict three types of droughts simultaneously. Multiple strategies are employed to quantify the importance of physical and biological features for drought prediction. Our results provide insights for researchers to better understand the predictability and sensitivity of drought to biological and physical conditions. We aim to contribute to the climate field by proposing a new tool to predict and understand the occurrence of droughts and provide the AI community with a new benchmark to study deep learning applications in climate science.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |

On this basis, a simple yet effective method named DropPatch is proposed, which has two remarkable advantages: 1) It improves the pre-training efficiency by a square-level advantage; 2) It provides additional advantages for modeling in scenarios such as in-domain, cross-domain, few-shot learning and cold start. This paper conducts comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the method and analyze its internal mechanism. Empirically, DropPatch strengthens the attention mechanism, reduces information redundancy and serves as an efficient means of data augmentation. Theoretically, it is proved that DropPatch slows down the rate at which the Transformer representations collapse into the rank-1 linear subspace by randomly dropping patches, thus optimizing the quality of the learned representations</p></details> |  |
| **[PCA-Featured Transformer for Jamming Detection in 5G UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15312v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jamming attacks pose a threat to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) wireless communication systems, potentially disrupting essential services and compromising network reliability. Current detection approaches struggle with sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) jamming techniques that adapt their patterns while existing machine learning solutions often require extensive feature engineering and fail to capture complex temporal dependencies in attack signatures. Furthermore, 5G networks using either Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) methods can face service degradation from intentional interference sources. To address these challenges, we present a novel transformer-based deep learning framework for jamming detection with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) added features. Our architecture leverages the transformer's self-attention mechanism to capture complex temporal dependencies and spatial correlations in wireless signal characteristics, enabling more robust jamming detection techniques. The U-shaped model incorporates a modified transformer encoder that processes signal features including received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) measurements, alongside a specialized positional encoding scheme that accounts for the periodic nature of wireless signals. In addition, we propose a batch size scheduler and implement chunking techniques to optimize training convergence for time series data. These advancements contribute to achieving up to a ten times improvement in training speed within the advanced U-shaped encoder-decoder model introduced. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a detection accuracy of 90.33 \% in Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 84.35 % in non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) and outperforms machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions such as the XGBoost (XGB) classifier in approximately 4%.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to the clustering of timed sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed sequences. This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

Increasingly, people use a wide range of mobile phone apps in their daily lives to connect socially, search for information, make decisions, and arrange travel, amongst many other reasons. However, the relationship between online app usage and urban vibrancy remains unclear, particularly regarding how sociospatial behaviours interact with urban features. Here, we use app-usage data as a digital signature to investigate this question. To do this, we use a high-resolution data source of mobile service-level traffic volumes across eighteen cities in France. We investigate the social component of cities using socially relevant urban features constructed from OpenStreetMap 'Points of Interest'. We developed a methodology for identifying and classifying multidimensional app usage time series based on similarity. We used these in predictive models to interpret the results for each city and across France. Across cities, there were spatial behavioural archetypes, characterised by multidimensional properties. We found patterns between the week and the weekend, and across cities, and the country. These archetypes correspond to changes in socially relevant urban features that impact urban vibrancy. Our results add further evidence for the importance of using computational approaches to understand urban environments, the use of sociological concepts in computational science, and urban vibrancy in cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 10 figures.

Traditional $k$-means clustering is commonly used for categorizing regional variability of sea level, however, its results are not robust against a number of factors. This study analyzed fourteen datasets of monthly sea level in fourteen shoreline regions of Peninsular Malaysia. We applied a hybridization of clustering technique to analyze data categorization and topological data analysis method to enhance the performance of our clustering analysis. Specifically, our approach utilized the persistent homology and $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering. The fourteen data sets from fourteen tide gauge stations were categorized in classes based on a prior categorization that was determined by topological information, and the probability of data points that belong to certain groups that is yielded by $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering.

In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive demand forecasting system that tackles hierarchical time series forecasting in business settings. Though traditional hierarchical reconciliation methods ensure forecasting coherence, they often trade off accuracy for coherence especially at lower levels and fail to capture the seasonality unique to each time-series in the hierarchy. Thus, we propose a novel framework "Multi-Stage Hierarchical Forecasting Reconciliation and Adjustment (Multi-Stage HiFoReAd)" to address the challenges of preserving seasonality, ensuring coherence, and improving accuracy. Our system first utilizes diverse models, ensembled through Bayesian Optimization (BO), achieving base forecasts. The generated base forecasts are then passed into the Multi-Stage HiFoReAd framework. The initial stage refines the hierarchy using Top-Down forecasts and "harmonic alignment." The second stage aligns the higher levels' forecasts using MinTrace algorithm, following which the last two levels undergo "harmonic alignment" and "stratified scaling", to eventually achieve accurate and coherent forecasts across the whole hierarchy. Our experiments on Walmart's internal Ads-demand dataset and 3 other public datasets, each with 4 hierarchical levels, demonstrate that the average Absolute Percentage Error from the cross-validation sets improve from 3% to 40% across levels against BO-ensemble of models (LGBM, MSTL+ETS, Prophet) as well as from 1.2% to 92.9% against State-Of-The-Art models. In addition, the forecasts at all hierarchical levels are proved to be coherent. The proposed framework has been deployed and leveraged by Walmart's ads, sales and operations teams to track future demands, make informed decisions and plan resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData)</p></details> |

Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalTAD: Causal Implicit Generative Model for Debiased Online Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18820v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection, aiming to estimate the anomaly risk of trajectories given the Source-Destination (SD) pairs, has become a critical problem for many real-world applications. Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum advantage in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Our simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Efficient Representation Learning for Flight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16581v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory data plays a vital role in the traffic management community, especially for downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection. Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the domain shift problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE.

| **[Learning Group Interactions and Semantic Intentions for Multi-Object Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15673v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective modeling of group interactions and dynamic semantic intentions is crucial for forecasting behaviors like trajectories or movements. In complex scenarios like sports, agents' trajectories are influenced by group interactions and intentions, including team strategies and opponent actions. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that integrates group-level interactions into a conditional diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse trajectories aligned with specific group activity. To capture dynamic semantic intentions, we frame group interaction prediction as a cooperative game, using Banzhaf interaction to model cooperation trends. We then fuse semantic intentions with enhanced agent embeddings, which are refined through both global and local aggregation. Furthermore, we expand the NBA SportVU dataset by adding human annotations of team-level tactics for trajectory and tactic prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on three widely-adopted datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to replan folding trajectory at every time step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from geometric features. These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths. Our experiments demonstrate AdaFold's ability to adapt folding trajectories of cloths with varying physical properties and generalize from simulated training to real-world execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[LeviTor: 3D Trajectory Oriented Image-to-Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15214v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intuitive nature of drag-based interaction has led to its growing adoption for controlling object trajectories in image-to-video synthesis. Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |
| **[Tracing the Roots: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Trajectories for Origin Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07449v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, garnering significant research interest in recent years. Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Accuracy Model Predictive Control with Inverse Hysteresis for High-Speed Trajectory Tracking of Piezoelectric Fast Steering Mirror](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14511v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piezoelectric fast steering mirrors (PFSM) are widely utilized in beam precision-pointing systems but encounter considerable challenges in achieving high-precision tracking of fast trajectories due to nonlinear hysteresis and mechanical dual-axis cross-coupling. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the Hammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the rate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral variable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors. Moreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are provided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the rate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are conducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared to traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed method significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior tracking performance and robustness to frequency variations. These results offer valuable insights for engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, serving as an intermediate link between perception and planning. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. Current trajectory prediction methods typically use the historical trajectory and vehicle attributes as inputs, focusing primarily on how historical information influences the future trajectory of the target vehicle. In real-world driving scenarios, however, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical data but also by the behavior of other vehicles on the road. To address this, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between the ego vehicle's planned trajectory and the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose a target's endpoint prediction module. This module first predicts the possible endpoints of the target vehicle, then refines these predictions through a correction mechanism, and finally generates a complete multimodal predicted trajectory based on the corrected endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other trajectory prediction methods, EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE evaluation metrics on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. These results highlight the strong performance of EPN in trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

Factors such as demographics, genetic conditions, and lifestyle contribute to diverse phenotypical manifestations, necessitating patient stratification based on these variations. Recent methods like Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) have advanced unsupervised stratification of disease trajectories, but they face potential limitations in robustness, interpretability, and temporal granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce Disease Progression Modelling and Stratification (DP-MoSt), a novel probabilistic method that optimises clusters of continuous trajectories over a long-term disease time-axis while estimating the confidence of trajectory sub-types for each biomarker. We validate DP-MoSt using both synthetic and real-world data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited coverage and energy of UAVs make it difficult to provide timely wireless service for large-scale sensor networks, which also exist in multiple UAVs. To this end, the advanced collaboration mechanism of UAVs urgently needs to be designed. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV collaborative scheme for seamless data collection and transmission, where UAVs are dispatched to collection points (CPs) to collect and transmit the time-critical data to the ground base station (BS) simultaneously through the cooperative backhaul link. Specifically, the mission completion time is minimized by optimizing the trajectories, task allocation, collection time scheduling, and transmission topology of UAVs while ensuring backhaul link to the BS. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly. To tackle this problem, the CP locations and transmission topology of UAVs are obtained by sensor node (SN) clustering and region division. Next, the transmission connectivity condition between UAVs is derived to facilitate the trajectory discretization and thus reduce the dimensions of variables. This simplifies the problem to optimizing the UAV hovering locations, hovering time, and CP serving sequence. Then, we propose a point-matching-based trajectory planning algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the two benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to WCNC Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Utilizing a continuous-time trajectory allows us to consider the ego-motion of the LiDAR scanner while recording a single scan directly in the least squares adjustment. Furthermore, pruning the search space of correspondences and utilizing out-of-core circular buffer enables our approach to align thousands of point clouds efficiently. We successfully align point clouds recorded with a handheld LiDAR, as well as ones mounted on a vehicle, and are able to perform multi-session alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Traditional models often struggle with real-time processing, capturing non-linearity and uncertainty in traffic environments, efficiency in dense traffic, and modeling temporal dynamics of interactions. We introduce NEST (Neuromodulated Small-world Hypergraph Trajectory Prediction), a novel framework that integrates Small-world Networks and hypergraphs for superior interaction modeling and prediction accuracy. This integration enables the capture of both local and extended vehicle interactions, while the Neuromodulator component adapts dynamically to changing traffic conditions.

This means that both the filtering and predicted densities for the set of targets are PMBM. In this paper, we first show that the PMBM density is also conjugate for sets of trajectories with the standard point target measurement model. Second, based on this theoretical foundation, we develop two trajectory PMBM filters that provide recursions to calculate the posterior density for the set of all trajectories that have ever been present in the surveillance area, and the posterior density of the set of trajectories present at the current time step in the surveillance area. These two filters therefore provide complete probabilistic information on the considered trajectories enabling optimal trajectory estimation. Third, we establish that the density of the set of trajectories in any time window, given the measurements in a possibly different time window, is also a PMBM. Finally, the trajectory PMBM filters are evaluated via simulations, and are shown to yield state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-target tracking algorithms based on random finite sets and multiple hypothesis tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 h rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a Toy-GS method for accurately rendering large-scale free camera trajectories. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial division approach for free trajectories to divide cameras and the sparse point cloud of the entire scene into various regions according to camera poses. Training each local Gaussian in parallel for each area enables us to concentrate on texture details and minimize GPU memory usage. Next, we use the multi-view constraint and position-aware point adaptive control (PPAC) to improve the rendering quality of texture details. In addition, our regional fusion approach combines local and global Gaussians to enhance rendering quality with an increasing number of divided areas. Extensive experiments have been carried out to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Toy-GS, leading to state-of-the-art results on two public large-scale datasets as well as our SCUTic dataset. Our proposal demonstrates an enhancement of 1.19 dB in PSNR and conserves 7 G of GPU memory when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of such agents is hindered by the lack of high-quality, multi-step trajectory data required for effective training. Existing approaches rely on expensive and labor-intensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. To address this challenge, we propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality GUI agent trajectories by leveraging web tutorials. Our method automatically gathers tutorial-like texts from the internet, transforms them into task goals with step-by-step instructions, and employs a visual-language model agent to simulate their execution in a real digital environment. A VLM-based evaluator ensures the correctness of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with these synthesized trajectories significantly improves their grounding and planning performance over the current models. Moreover, our approach is more cost-efficient compared to traditional human annotation methods. This work underscores the potential of guided replay with web tutorials as a viable strategy for large-scale GUI agent training, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

This study addresses this gap by introducing an online nonlinear programming trajectory optimization framework that integrates a differentiable energy model into autonomous systems. By leveraging traffic and slope profile predictions within a safety-critical framework, the proposed method enhances fuel efficiency for both sedans and diesel trucks by 3.71\% and 7.15\%, respectively, when compared to traditional model-agnostic quadratic programming techniques. These improvements translate to a potential \$6.14 billion economic benefit for the U.S. trucking industry. This work bridges the gap between model-agnostic autonomous driving and model-aware ECO-driving, highlighting a practical pathway for integrating energy efficiency into real-time trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Agnostic Visual Servoing considering kinematic constraints enabled by a decoupled network trajectory planner structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07017v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a visual servoing method consisting of a detection network and a velocity trajectory planner. First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Mojito, a diffusion model that incorporates both \textbf{Mo}tion tra\textbf{j}ectory and \textbf{i}ntensi\textbf{t}y contr\textbf{o}l for text to video generation. Specifically, Mojito features a Directional Motion Control module that leverages cross-attention to efficiently direct the generated object's motion without additional training, alongside a Motion Intensity Modulator that uses optical flow maps generated from videos to guide varying levels of motion intensity. Extensive experiments demonstrate Mojito's effectiveness in achieving precise trajectory and intensity control with high computational efficiency, generating motion patterns that closely match specified directions and intensities, providing realistic dynamics that align well with natural motion in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</p></details> |  |

Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset.

| **[Real-Time Trajectory Generation for Soft Robot Manipulators Using Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08568v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have the potential to interact with sensitive environments and perform complex tasks effectively. However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |

Each joint has limits in the ranges of position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions, this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach with simulations and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 pictures</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally, we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle, combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various automated driving problems.</p></details> |  |

Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck.

In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

While existing 3D editing methods excel at modifying color, texture, and style, they struggle with extensive geometric or appearance changes, thus limiting their applications. We propose Perturb-and-Revise, which makes possible a variety of NeRF editing. First, we perturb the NeRF parameters with random initializations to create a versatile initialization. We automatically determine the perturbation magnitude through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Perturb-and-Revise facilitates flexible, effective, and consistent editing of color, appearance, and geometry in 3D.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong performances in comparison to state of-the-art methods on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04184v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.</p></details> | 16 |

The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[Abstraction-based Control of Unknown Continuous-Space Models with Just Two Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03892v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) offer an effective scheme for approximating the complex continuous-space systems with simpler models in the discrete-space domain. A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal relation between the original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a discrete controller designed for the symbolic model can be effectively implemented as a hybrid controller (using an interface map) for the original system. This task becomes even more challenging when the exact mathematical model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To address this, the existing literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven methods, which require collecting a large amount of data from the original system. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state trajectories collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a hybrid controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the concept of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness between the state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven symbolic model. By satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data, which intuitively ensures that the unknown system is persistently excited, we directly design an ASF and its corresponding hybrid controller using finite-length data without explicitly identifying the unknown system, while providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach through a case study.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</p></details> |  |

Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference Research (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |

When a new variant emerges in one or more countries, other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The impact of the new variant and the timings of epidemic peaks in a country highly depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest and has a significant prevalence. Can we predict when a variant existing elsewhere will arrive in a given region? To address this question, we propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach. First, we derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across pairs of regions (countries) that apply to a large class of epidemic models. The dynamics motivate the introduction of certain features in the GNN. We demonstrate that our proposed dynamics-informed GNN outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). To advance research in this area, we introduce a benchmarking tool to assess a user-defined model's prediction performance across 87 countries and 36 variants.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods face challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small-object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates a DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thereby ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Additionally, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques were applied to DGNN-YOLO to provide model-agnostic interpretability and deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing its transparency and trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This study provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a significant approach for estimating the binding strength between drugs and target proteins. However, existing methods simply utilize the drug's local information from molecular topology rather than global information. Additionally, the features of drugs and proteins are usually fused with a simple concatenation operation, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we proposed ViDTA, an enhanced DTA prediction framework. We introduce virtual nodes into the Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based drug feature extraction network, which acts as a global memory to exchange messages more efficiently. By incorporating virtual graph nodes, we seamlessly integrate local and global features of drug molecular structures, expanding the GNN's receptive field. Additionally, we propose an attention-based linear feature fusion network for better capturing the interaction information between drugs and proteins. Experimental results evaluated on various benchmarks including Davis, Metz, and KIBA demonstrate that our proposed ViDTA outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM 24)</p></details> |

While deep collaborative filtering approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing user-item relationships, their effectiveness is limited when handling sparse data or zero-shot scenarios, primarily due to constraints in ID-based embedding functions. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation instruction-tuning paradigm that seamlessly integrates large language models with collaborative filtering. Our proposed Recommendation Language Model (RecLM) enhances the capture of user preference diversity through a carefully designed reinforcement learning reward function that facilitates self-augmentation of language models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant advantages of our approach across various settings, and its plug-and-play compatibility with state-of-the-art recommender systems results in notable performance enhancements.</p></details> |  |

In the real world, however, the graph data can suffer from significant distribution shifts across clients as the clients may collect their graph data for different purposes. In particular, graph properties are usually associated with invariant label-relevant substructures (i.e., subgraphs) across clients, while label-irrelevant substructures can appear in a client-specific manner. The issue of distribution shifts of graph data hinders the efficiency of GNN training and leads to serious performance degradation in FGL. To tackle the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel FGL framework entitled FedVN that eliminates distribution shifts through client-specific graph augmentation strategies with multiple learnable Virtual Nodes (VNs). Specifically, FedVN lets the clients jointly learn a set of shared VNs while training a global GNN model. To eliminate distribution shifts, each client trains a personalized edge generator that determines how the VNs connect local graphs in a client-specific manner. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses indicating that FedVN can eliminate distribution shifts of graph data across clients. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets under five settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FedVN over nine baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field through the development of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, GNNs are still deficient in generalizing to diverse graph data. Aiming to this issue, Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide new solutions for graph mining tasks with their superior semantic understanding. In this review, we systematically review the combination and application techniques of LLMs and GNNs and present a novel taxonomy for research in this interdisciplinary field, which involves three main categories: GNN-driving-LLM, LLM-driving-GNN, and GNN-LLM-co-driving. Within this framework, we reveal the capabilities of LLMs in enhancing graph feature extraction as well as improving the effectiveness of downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Although LLMs have demonstrated their great potential in handling graph-structured data, their high computational requirements and complexity remain challenges. Future research needs to continue to explore how to efficiently fuse LLMs and GNNs to achieve more powerful graph learning and reasoning capabilities and provide new impetus for the development of graph mining techniques.</p></details> |  |

Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Training for Graph Neural Networks via Graph Subspace Energy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18886v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive capability in learning over graph-structured data, graph neural networks (GNN) suffer from adversarial topology perturbation in both training and inference phases. While adversarial training has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image classification tasks, its suitability for GNN models has been doubted until a recent advance that shifts the focus from transductive to inductive learning. Still, GNN robustness in the inductive setting is under-explored, and it calls for deeper understanding of GNN adversarial training. To this end, we propose a new concept of graph subspace energy (GSE) -- a generalization of graph energy that measures graph stability -- of the adjacency matrix, as an indicator of GNN robustness against topology perturbations. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of such concept, we propose an adversarial training method with the perturbed graphs generated by maximizing the GSE regularization term, referred to as AT-GSE. To deal with the local and global topology perturbations raised respectively by LRBCD and PRBCD, we employ randomized SVD (RndSVD) and Nystrom low-rank approximation to favor the different aspects of the GSE terms. An extensive set of experiments shows that AT-GSE outperforms consistently the state-of-the-art GNN adversarial training methods over different homophily and heterophily datasets in terms of adversarial accuracy, whilst more surprisingly achieving a superior clean accuracy on non-perturbed graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Federated Graph Learning via Adaptive Fusion of Structural and Node Characteristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18845v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has demonstrated the advantage of training a global Graph Neural Network (GNN) model across distributed clients using their local graph data. Unlike Euclidean data (\eg, images), graph data is composed of nodes and edges, where the overall node-edge connections determine the topological structure, and individual nodes along with their neighbors capture local node features. However, existing studies tend to prioritize one aspect over the other, leading to an incomplete understanding of the data and the potential misidentification of key characteristics across varying graph scenarios. Additionally, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of graph data makes the extraction of these two data characteristics even more challenging. To address the above issues, we propose a novel FGL framework, named FedGCF, which aims to simultaneously extract and fuse structural properties and node features to effectively handle diverse graph scenarios. FedGCF first clusters clients by structural similarity, performing model aggregation within each cluster to form the shared structural model. Next, FedGCF selects the clients with common node features and aggregates their models to generate a common node model. This model is then propagated to all clients, allowing common node features to be shared. By combining these two models with a proper ratio, FedGCF can achieve a comprehensive understanding of the graph data and deliver better performance, even under non-IID distributions. Experimental results show that FedGCF improves accuracy by 4.94%-7.24% under different data distributions and reduces communication cost by 64.18%-81.25% to reach the same accuracy compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Multi-Graphs Learning for Robust Group Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18766v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Re-identification (G-ReID) faces greater complexity than individual Re-identification (ReID) due to challenges like mutual occlusion, dynamic member interactions, and evolving group structures. Prior graph-based approaches have aimed to capture these dynamics by modeling the group as a single topological structure. However, these methods struggle to generalize across diverse group compositions, as they fail to fully represent the multifaceted relationships within the group. In this study, we introduce a Hierarchical Multi-Graphs Learning (HMGL) framework to address these challenges. Our approach models the group as a collection of multi-relational graphs, leveraging both explicit features (such as occlusion, appearance, and foreground information) and implicit dependencies between members. This hierarchical representation, encoded via a Multi-Graphs Neural Network (MGNN), allows us to resolve ambiguities in member relationships, particularly in complex, densely populated scenes. To further enhance matching accuracy, we propose a Multi-Scale Matching (MSM) algorithm, which mitigates issues of member information ambiguity and sensitivity to hard samples, improving robustness in challenging scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks, CSG and RoadGroup, with Rank-1/mAP scores of 95.3%/94.4% and 93.9%/95.4%, respectively. These results mark notable improvements of 1.7% and 2.5% in Rank-1 accuracy over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Time Series of Networked Dynamical Systems without Knowing Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18734v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world complex systems, such as epidemic spreading networks and ecosystems, can be modeled as networked dynamical systems that produce multivariate time series. Learning the intrinsic dynamics from observational data is pivotal for forecasting system behaviors and making informed decisions. However, existing methods for modeling networked time series often assume known topologies, whereas real-world networks are typically incomplete or inaccurate, with missing or spurious links that hinder precise predictions. Moreover, while networked time series often originate from diverse topologies, the ability of models to generalize across topologies has not been systematically evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a novel framework for learning network dynamics directly from observed time-series data, when prior knowledge of graph topology or governing dynamical equations is absent. Our approach leverages continuous graph neural networks with an attention mechanism to construct a latent topology, enabling accurate reconstruction of future trajectories for network states. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate that our model not only captures dynamics effectively without topology knowledge but also generalizes to unseen time series originating from diverse topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Lightweight Representation Learning for Link Sign Prediction in Signed Bipartite Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18720v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we effectively and efficiently learn node representations in signed bipartite graphs? A signed bipartite graph is a graph consisting of two nodes sets where nodes of different types are positively or negative connected, and it has been extensively used to model various real-world relationships such as e-commerce, etc. To analyze such a graph, previous studies have focused on designing methods for learning node representations using graph neural networks. In particular, these methods insert edges between nodes of the same type based on balance theory, enabling them to leverage augmented structures in their learning. However, the existing methods rely on a naive message passing design, which is prone to over-smoothing and susceptible to noisy interactions in real-world graphs. Furthermore, they suffer from computational inefficiency due to their heavy design and the significant increase in the number of added edges. In this paper, we propose ELISE, an effective and lightweight GNN-based approach for learning signed bipartite graphs. We first extend personalized propagation to a signed bipartite graph, incorporating signed edges during message passing. This extension adheres to balance theory without introducing additional edges, mitigating the over-smoothing issue and enhancing representation power. We then jointly learn node embeddings on a low-rank approximation of the signed bipartite graph, which reduces potential noise and emphasizes its global structure, further improving expressiveness without significant loss of efficiency. We encapsulate these ideas into ELISE, designing it to be lightweight, unlike the previous methods that add too many edges and cause inefficiency. Through extensive experiments on real-world signed bipartite graphs, we demonstrate that ELISE outperforms its competitors for predicting link signs while providing faster training and inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Extended Target Sensing in ISAC: Cramér-Rao Bound Analysis and Beamforming Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06353v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where the sensing target is a three-dimensional (3D) extended target, for which multiple scatterers from the target surface can be resolved. We first introduce a second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped 3D ET. Utilizing this model, we derive tractable Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for estimating the ET kinematic parameters, including the center range, azimuth, elevation, and orientation. These CRBs depend explicitly on the transmit covariance matrix and ET shape. Then we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems for the base station (BS) to simultaneously support communication with multiple users and sensing of the 3D ET. The first minimizes the sensing CRB while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each user, and it is solved using semidefinite relaxation. The second balances minimizing the CRB and maximizing communication rates through a weight factor, and is solved via successive convex approximation. To reduce the computational complexity, we further propose ISACBeam-GNN, a novel graph neural network-based beamforming method that employs a separate-then-integrate structure, learning communication and sensing (C&S) objectives independently before integrating them to balance C&S trade-offs. Simulation results show that the proposed beamforming designs that account for ET shapes significantly outperform existing baselines, offering better communication-sensing performance trade-offs as well as an improved beampattern for sensing. Results also demonstrate that ISACBeam-GNN is an efficient alternative to the optimization-based methods, with remarkable adaptability and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, partially published in IEEE Global Communications Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Are Evolutionary Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic duality between graph neural networks (GNNs) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), bridging two traditionally distinct fields. Building on this insight, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel evolutionary algorithm that models individuals as nodes in a graph and leverages designed frequency-domain filters to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Through the use of these filters, GNE aggregates high-frequency (diversity-enhancing) and low-frequency (stability-promoting) information, transforming EAs into interpretable and tunable mechanisms in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on benchmark functions demonstrate that GNE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as GA, DE, CMA-ES, SDAES, and RL-SHADE, excelling in complex landscapes, optimal solution shifts, and noisy environments. Its robustness, adaptability, and superior convergence highlight its practical and theoretical value. Beyond optimization, GNE establishes a conceptual and mathematical foundation linking EAs and GNNs, offering new perspectives for both fields. Its framework encourages the development of task-adaptive filters and hybrid approaches for EAs, while its insights can inspire advances in GNNs, such as improved global information propagation and mitigation of oversmoothing. GNE's versatility extends to solving challenges in machine learning, including hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search, as well as real-world applications in engineering and operations research. By uniting the dynamics of EAs with the structural insights of GNNs, this work provides a foundation for interdisciplinary innovation, paving the way for scalable and interpretable solutions to complex optimization problems.</p></details> | 31 pages, 10 figures |

However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, The 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |

To achieve such map-based localization, online high-definition (HD) map construction plays a significant role in accurate estimation of the pose. Although recent advancements in online HD map construction have predominantly investigated on vectorized representation due to its effectiveness, they suffer from computational cost and fixed parametric model, which limit scalability. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel HD map learning framework that leverages graph modeling. This framework is designed to learn the construction of diverse geometric shapes, thereby enhancing the scalability of HD map construction. Our approach involves representing the map elements as an instance-level graph by decomposing them into vertices and edges to facilitate accurate and efficient end-to-end vectorized HD map learning. Furthermore, we introduce an association strategy using a Graph Neural Network to efficiently handle the complex geometry of various map elements, while maintaining scalability. Comprehensive experiments on public open dataset show that our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art model by $1.6$ mAP. We further showcase the superior scalability of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving a $4.8$ mAP improvement in long range configuration.

Contemporary methods apply machine learning-based classifiers to detect fraudulent behavior from labeled transaction records. But labeled data are usually a small proportion of billions of real transactions due to expensive labeling costs, which implies that they do not well exploit many natural features from unlabeled data. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised graph neural network for fraud detection. Specifically, we leverage transaction records to construct a temporal transaction graph, which is composed of temporal transactions (nodes) and interactions (edges) among them. Then we pass messages among the nodes through a Gated Temporal Attention Network (GTAN) to learn the transaction representation. We further model the fraud patterns through risk propagation among transactions. The extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world transaction dataset and two publicly available fraud detection datasets. The result shows that our proposed method, namely GTAN, outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines on three fraud detection datasets. Semi-supervised experiments demonstrate the excellent fraud detection performance of our model with only a tiny proportion of labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, AAAI 2023, code: https://github.com/AI4Risk/antifraud</p></details> |
| **[NoiseHGNN: Synthesized Similarity Graph-Based Neural Network For Noised Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18267v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph data environments intrinsically exist noise (e.g., link and structure errors) that inevitably disturb the effectiveness of graph representation and downstream learning tasks. For homogeneous graphs, the latest works use original node features to synthesize a similarity graph that can correct the structure of the noised graph. This idea is based on the homogeneity assumption, which states that similar nodes in the homogeneous graph tend to have direct links in the original graph. However, similar nodes in heterogeneous graphs usually do not have direct links, which can not be used to correct the original noise graph. This causes a significant challenge in noised heterogeneous graph learning. To this end, this paper proposes a novel synthesized similarity-based graph neural network compatible with noised heterogeneous graph learning. First, we calculate the original feature similarities of all nodes to synthesize a similarity-based high-order graph. Second, we propose a similarity-aware encoder to embed original and synthesized graphs with shared parameters. Then, instead of graph-to-graph supervising, we synchronously supervise the original and synthesized graph embeddings to predict the same labels. Meanwhile, a target-based graph extracted from the synthesized graph contrasts the structure of the metapath-based graph extracted from the original graph to learn the mutual information. Extensive experiments in numerous real-world datasets show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art records in the noised heterogeneous graph learning tasks. In highlights, +5$\sim$6\% improvements are observed in several noised datasets compared with previous SOTA methods.

Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in the appendix where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in <0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 4 code snippets</p></details> |

However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.

Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN). Our XATGRN employs a cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture intricate gene interactions from gene expression profiles. Additionally, it uses a Dual Complex Graph Embedding approach to manage the skewed degree distribution, thereby ensuring precise prediction of regulatory relationships and their directionality. Our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets, underscoring its efficacy in elucidating complex gene regulatory mechanisms.

| **[Exact Acceleration of Subgraph Graph Neural Networks by Eliminating Computation Redundancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18125v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a prevalent framework for graph tasks. Many recent studies have proposed the use of graph convolution methods over the numerous subgraphs of each graph, a concept known as subgraph graph neural networks (subgraph GNNs), to enhance GNNs' ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. To maximize the expressiveness, subgraph GNNs often require each subgraph to have equal size to the original graph. Despite their impressive performance, subgraph GNNs face challenges due to the vast number and large size of subgraphs which lead to a surge in training data, resulting in both storage and computational inefficiencies. In response to this problem, this paper introduces Ego-Nets-Fit-All (ENFA), a model that uniformly takes the smaller ego nets as subgraphs, thereby providing greater storage and computational efficiency, while at the same time guarantees identical outputs to the original subgraph GNNs even taking the whole graph as subgraphs. The key is to identify and eliminate the redundant computation among subgraphs. For example, a node $v_i$ may appear in multiple subgraphs but is far away from all of their centers (the unsymmetric part between subgraphs). Therefore, its first few rounds of message passing within each subgraph can be computed once in the original graph instead of being computed multiple times within each subgraph. Such strategy enables our ENFA to accelerate subgraph GNNs in an exact way, unlike previous sampling approaches that often lose the performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets reveal that compared with the conventional subgraph GNNs, ENFA can reduce storage space by 29.0% to 84.5% and improve training efficiency by up to 1.66x.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Graph Condensation to Multi-Label Datasets: A Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17961v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As graph data grows increasingly complicate, training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale datasets presents significant challenges, including computational resource constraints, data redundancy, and transmission inefficiencies. While existing graph condensation techniques have shown promise in addressing these issues, they are predominantly designed for single-label datasets, where each node is associated with a single class label. However, many real-world applications, such as social network analysis and bioinformatics, involve multi-label graph datasets, where one node can have various related labels. To deal with this problem, we extends traditional graph condensation approaches to accommodate multi-label datasets by introducing modifications to synthetic dataset initialization and condensing optimization. Through experiments on eight real-world multi-label graph datasets, we prove the effectiveness of our method. In experiment, the GCond framework, combined with K-Center initialization and binary cross-entropy loss (BCELoss), achieves best performance in general. This benchmark for multi-label graph condensation not only enhances the scalability and efficiency of GNNs for multi-label graph data, but also offering substantial benefits for diverse real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI Workshop Paper (MALTA)</p></details> |
| **[LASE: Learned Adjacency Spectral Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17734v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We put forth a principled design of a neural architecture to learn nodal Adjacency Spectral Embeddings (ASE) from graph inputs. By bringing to bear the gradient descent (GD) method and leveraging the principle of algorithm unrolling, we truncate and re-interpret each GD iteration as a layer in a graph neural network (GNN) that is trained to approximate the ASE. Accordingly, we call the resulting embeddings and our parametric model Learned ASE (LASE), which is interpretable, parameter efficient, robust to inputs with unobserved edges, and offers controllable complexity during inference. LASE layers combine Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and fully-connected Graph Attention Network (GAT) modules, which is intuitively pleasing since GCN-based local aggregations alone are insufficient to express the sought graph eigenvectors. We propose several refinements to the unrolled LASE architecture (such as sparse attention in the GAT module and decoupled layerwise parameters) that offer favorable approximation error versus computation tradeoffs; even outperforming heavily-optimized eigendecomposition routines from scientific computing libraries. Because LASE is a differentiable function with respect to its parameters as well as its graph input, we can seamlessly integrate it as a trainable module within a larger (semi-)supervised graph representation learning pipeline. The resulting end-to-end system effectively learns ``discriminative ASEs'' that exhibit competitive performance in supervised link prediction and node classification tasks, outperforming a GNN even when the latter is endowed with open loop, meaning task-agnostic, precomputed spectral positional encodings.</p></details> |  |

We build upon a purely structural pretraining approach and propose an extension to capture feature information while still being feature-agnostic. We evaluate pretrained models on downstream tasks for varying amounts of training samples and choices of pretraining datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that embeddings from pretrained models improve generalization only with enough downstream data points and in a degree which depends on the quantity and properties of pretraining data. Feature information can lead to improvements, but currently requires some similarities between pretraining and downstream feature spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the NeurIPS 2024 workshop "Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations" (NeuReps 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Size-imbalanced Learning with Energy-guided Structural Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17591v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph is a prevalent data structure employed to represent the relationships between entities, frequently serving as a tool to depict and simulate numerous systems, such as molecules and social networks. However, real-world graphs usually suffer from the size-imbalanced problem in the multi-graph classification, i.e., a long-tailed distribution with respect to the number of nodes. Recent studies find that off-the-shelf Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would compromise model performance under the long-tailed settings. We investigate this phenomenon and discover that the long-tailed graph distribution greatly exacerbates the discrepancies in structural features. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel energy-based size-imbalanced learning framework named \textbf{SIMBA}, which smooths the features between head and tail graphs and re-weights them based on the energy propagation. Specifically, we construct a higher-level graph abstraction named \textit{Graphs-to-Graph} according to the correlations between graphs to link independent graphs and smooths the structural discrepancies. We further devise an energy-based message-passing belief propagation method for re-weighting lower compatible graphs in the training process and further smooth local feature discrepancies. Extensive experimental results over five public size-imbalanced datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the model for size-imbalanced graph classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM'25)</p></details> |

This paper presents a new type of graph attention network, called TempoKGAT, which combines time-decaying weight and a selective neighbor aggregation mechanism on the spatial domain, which helps uncover latent patterns in the graph data. In this approach, a top-k neighbor selection based on the edge weights is introduced to represent the evolving features of the graph data. We evaluated the performance of our TempoKGAT on multiple datasets from the traffic, energy, and health sectors involving spatio-temporal data. We compared the performance of our approach to several state-of-the-art methods found in the literature on several open-source datasets. Our method shows superior accuracy on all datasets. These results indicate that TempoKGAT builds on existing methodologies to optimize prediction accuracy and provide new insights into model interpretation in temporal contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Line Graph Vietoris-Rips Persistence Diagram for Topological Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17468v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While message passing graph neural networks result in informative node embeddings, they may suffer from describing the topological properties of graphs. To this end, node filtration has been widely used as an attempt to obtain the topological information of a graph using persistence diagrams. However, these attempts have faced the problem of losing node embedding information, which in turn prevents them from providing a more expressive graph representation. To tackle this issue, we shift our focus to edge filtration and introduce a novel edge filtration-based persistence diagram, named Topological Edge Diagram (TED), which is mathematically proven to preserve node embedding information as well as contain additional topological information. To implement TED, we propose a neural network based algorithm, named Line Graph Vietoris-Rips (LGVR) Persistence Diagram, that extracts edge information by transforming a graph into its line graph. Through LGVR, we propose two model frameworks that can be applied to any message passing GNNs, and prove that they are strictly more powerful than Weisfeiler-Lehman type colorings. Finally we empirically validate superior performance of our models on several graph classification and regression benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages.

To enhance analysis and comprehension of brain activity, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to the analysis of functional connectivities (FC) derived from fMRI data, due to their ability to capture the synergistic interactions among brain regions. However, in the human brain, performing complex tasks typically involves the activation of certain pathways, which could be represented as paths across graphs. As such, conventional GNNs struggle to learn from these pathways due to the long-range dependencies of multiple pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework BrainMAP to learn Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain networks. BrainMAP leverages sequential models to identify long-range correlations among sequentialized brain regions and incorporates an aggregation module based on Mixture of Experts (MoE) to learn from multiple pathways. Our comprehensive experiments highlight BrainMAP's superior performance. Furthermore, our framework enables explanatory analyses of crucial brain regions involved in tasks.

We present ORIGAMI (Object RepresentatIon via Generative Autoregressive ModellIng), a transformer-based architecture that directly processes nested key/value pairs while preserving their hierarchical semantics. Our key technical contributions include: (1) a structure-preserving tokenizer, (2) a novel key/value position encoding scheme, and (3) a grammar-constrained training and inference framework that ensures valid outputs and accelerates training convergence. These enhancements enable efficient end-to-end modeling of semi-structured data. By reformulating classification as next-token prediction, ORIGAMI naturally handles both single-label and multi-label tasks without architectural modifications. Empirical evaluation across diverse domains demonstrates ORIGAMI's effectiveness: On standard tabular benchmarks converted to JSON, ORIGAMI remains competitive with classical and state-of-the-art approaches. On native JSON datasets, we outperform baselines on multi-label classification and specialized models such as convolutional and graph neural networks on a code classification task. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate the impact of each architectural component and establish ORIGAMI as a robust framework for end-to-end learning on semi-structured data.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the insufficient modeling of the biological information in PPI networks, more faithfully depiction of complex protein interaction patterns for cancer genes within the graph structure remains largely unexplored. This study takes a pioneering step toward bridging biological anomalies in protein interactions caused by cancer genes to statistical graph anomaly. We find a unique graph anomaly exhibited by cancer genes, namely weight heterogeneity, which manifests as significantly higher variance in edge weights of cancer gene nodes within the graph. Additionally, from the spectral perspective, we demonstrate that the weight heterogeneity could lead to the "flattening out" of spectral energy, with a concentration towards the extremes of the spectrum. Building on these insights, we propose the HIerarchical-Perspective Graph Neural Network (HIPGNN) that not only determines spectral energy distribution variations on the spectral perspective, but also perceives detailed protein interaction context on the spatial perspective. Extensive experiments are conducted on two reprocessed datasets STRINGdb and CPDB, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HIPGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>It ha...</summary><p>It has been accepted by the AAAI 2025 conference</p></details> |

By monitoring, analysing, and evaluating rainfall data at a local level, it is not only possible to take effective actions to prevent any severe climate variation but also to improve the planning of surface and underground hydrological resources. However, developing countries often lack the weather stations to collect data continuously due to the high cost of installation and maintenance. In light of this, the contribution of the present paper is twofold: first, we propose a low-cost IoT system for automatic recording, monitoring, and prediction of rainfall in rural regions. Second, we propose a novel approach to regional heavy rainfall prediction by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs), which are particularly well-suited for capturing the complex spatial dependencies inherent in rainfall patterns. The proposed approach was tested using a historical dataset spanning 72 months, with daily measurements, and experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting heavy rainfall events, making this approach particularly attractive for regions with limited resources or where traditional weather radar or station coverage is sparse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2024 Latin American Conference on Computational Intelligence (IEEE LA-CCI 2024)</p></details> |

While most of the earlier works address the complex nature of graph-structured data and predefined anomalies, the impact of data attributes and emerging anomalies are often neglected. This paper introduces DCOR, a novel approach on attributed networks that integrates reconstruction-based anomaly detection with Contrastive Learning. Utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, DCOR contrasts the reconstructed adjacency and feature matrices from both the original and augmented graphs to detect subtle anomalies. We employed comprehensive experimental studies on benchmark datasets through standard evaluation measures. The results show that DCOR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approach in attributed networks with the potential of uncovering new patterns of anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Complex Networks and Their Applications</p></details> |

However, ensuring their generalizability beyond training data is crucial for their wide application in studying solid materials. This work investigates the ability of a graph neural network (GNN)-based MLFF, trained on Lennard-Jones Argon, to describe solid-state phenomena not explicitly included during training. We assess the MLFF's performance in predicting phonon density of states (PDOS) for a perfect face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at both zero and finite temperatures. Additionally, we evaluate vacancy migration rates and energy barriers in an imperfect crystal using direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the string method. Notably, vacancy configurations were absent from the training data. Our results demonstrate the MLFF's capability to capture essential solid-state properties with good agreement to reference data, even for unseen configurations. We further discuss data engineering strategies to enhance the generalizability of MLFFs. The proposed set of benchmark tests and workflow for evaluating MLFF performance in describing perfect and imperfect crystals pave the way for reliable application of MLFFs in studying complex solid-state materials.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 11 figures for the main manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Network Training Efficiency by Constructing Training Sets with Noise-Susceptible Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are among the most powerful neural network architectures currently available. Unlike traditional neural networks that solely rely on the feature vector of the data to be processed as input, GNNs utilize both the graph that represents the relationships between data points and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability allows GNNs to achieve superior performance in various tasks. However, GNNs are highly susceptible to noise, which can significantly degrade their performance in common tasks such as classification and prediction. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging spectral analysis to identify and select the points most sensitive to noise for constructing the training set. By training GNNs on these noise-sensitive points, experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in training efficiency compared to using randomly selected training sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware knowledge graph framework for traffic speed forecasting using graph neural network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17703v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to insufficient integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed utilizing these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG's configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model establishes a benchmark for 10-120 min predictions, achieving average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of $3.46\pm0.01$, $14.76\pm0.09\%$, and $5.08\pm0.01$, respectively. Compared to the baseline DCRNN model, integrating the spatial unit improves the MAE by 0.04 and the temporal unit by 0.13, while integrating both units further reduces it by 0.18. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model's ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. Overall, this study underscores the importance of merging context-aware knowledge graphs with graph neural networks to improve traffic forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Guided Fair Graph Sampling for Water Temperature Prediction in River Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16523v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel graph neural networks (GNNs)-based method to predict stream water temperature and reduce model bias across locations of different income and education levels. Traditional physics-based models often have limited accuracy because they are necessarily approximations of reality. Recently, there has been an increasing interest of using GNNs in modeling complex water dynamics in stream networks. Despite their promise in improving the accuracy, GNNs can bring additional model bias through the aggregation process, where node features are updated by aggregating neighboring nodes. The bias can be especially pronounced when nodes with similar sensitive attributes are frequently connected. We introduce a new method that leverages physical knowledge to represent the node influence in GNNs, and then utilizes physics-based influence to refine the selection and weights over the neighbors. The objective is to facilitate equitable treatment over different sensitive groups in the graph aggregation, which helps reduce spatial bias over locations, especially for those in underprivileged groups. The results on the Delaware River Basin demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving equitable performance across locations in different sensitive groups.</p></details> |  |

To accurately represent molecules, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown potential in the realm of self-supervised pretraining. However, existing approaches often overlook the relationship between molecular structure and electronic information, as well as the internal semantic reasoning within molecules. This omission of fundamental chemical knowledge in graph semantics leads to incomplete molecular representations, missing the integration of structural and electronic data. To address these issues, we introduce MOL-Mamba, a framework that enhances molecular representation by combining structural and electronic insights. MOL-Mamba consists of an Atom & Fragment Mamba-Graph (MG) for hierarchical structural reasoning and a Mamba-Transformer (MT) fuser for integrating molecular structure and electronic correlation learning. Additionally, we propose a Structural Distribution Collaborative Training and E-semantic Fusion Training framework to further enhance molecular representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOL-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across eleven chemical-biological molecular datasets.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their strengths in capturing data relationships, particularly in contextual information modeling and multimodal fusion. However, existing methods often struggle to fully capture the complex interactions between multiple modalities and conversational context, limiting their expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose ConxGNN, a novel GNN-based framework designed to capture contextual information in conversations. ConxGNN features two key parallel modules: a multi-scale heterogeneous graph that captures the diverse effects of utterances on emotional changes, and a hypergraph that models the multivariate relationships among modalities and utterances. The outputs from these modules are integrated into a fusion layer, where a cross-modal attention mechanism is applied to produce a contextually enriched representation. Additionally, ConxGNN tackles the challenge of recognizing minority or semantically similar emotion classes by incorporating a re-weighting scheme into the loss functions. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Cross-Task Generalities Across Graphs via Task-trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models aim to create general, cross-task, and cross-domain machine learning models by pretraining on large-scale datasets to capture shared patterns or concepts (generalities), such as contours, colors, textures, and edges in images, or tokens, words, and sentences in text. However, discovering generalities across graphs remains challenging, which has hindered the development of graph foundation models. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn generalities across graphs via task-trees. Specifically, we first define the basic learning instances in graphs as task-trees and assume that the generalities shared across graphs are, at least partially, preserved in the task-trees of the given graphs. To validate the assumption, we first perform a theoretical analysis of task-trees in terms of stability, transferability, and generalization. We find that if a graph neural network (GNN) model is pretrained on diverse task-trees through a reconstruction task, it can learn sufficient transferable knowledge for downstream tasks using an appropriate set of fine-tuning samples. To empirically validate the assumption, we further instantiate the theorems by developing a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named Graph generality Identifier on task-Trees (GIT). The extensive experiments over 30 graphs from five domains demonstrate the effectiveness of GIT in fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot learning scenarios. Particularly, the general GIT model pretrained on large-scale datasets can be quickly adapted to specific domains, matching or even surpassing expert models designed for those domains. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</p></details> |  |

Recent attention has pivoted towards more intricate structures, encompassing (1) static heterophilic graphs encountering the edge heterophily issue in the spatial domain and (2) event-based continuous graphs in the temporal domain. State-of-the-art (SOTA) has been concurrently addressing these two lines of work but tends to overlook the presence of heterophily in the temporal domain, constituting the temporal heterophily issue. Furthermore, we highlight that the edge heterophily issue and the temporal heterophily issue often co-exist in event-based continuous graphs, giving rise to the temporal edge heterophily challenge. To tackle this challenge, this paper first introduces the temporal edge heterophily measurement. Subsequently, we propose the Temporal Heterophilic Graph Convolutional Network (THeGCN), an innovative model that incorporates the low/high-pass graph signal filtering technique to accurately capture both edge (spatial) heterophily and temporal heterophily. Specifically, the THeGCN model consists of two key components: a sampler and an aggregator. The sampler selects events relevant to a node at a given moment. Then, the aggregator executes message-passing, encoding temporal information, node attributes, and edge attributes into node embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 real-world datasets validate the efficacy of THeGCN.</p></details> |  |

Two common methods for training GNNs are mini-batch training and full-graph training. Since these two methods require different training pipelines and systems optimizations, two separate classes of GNN training systems emerged, each tailored for one method. Works that introduce systems belonging to a particular category predominantly compare them with other systems within the same category, offering limited or no comparison with systems from the other category. Some prior work also justifies its focus on one specific training method by arguing that it achieves higher accuracy than the alternative. The literature, however, has incomplete and contradictory evidence in this regard. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of representative full-graph and mini-batch GNN training systems. We find that the mini-batch training systems consistently converge faster than the full-graph training ones across multiple datasets, GNN models, and system configurations. We also find that mini-batch training techniques converge to similar to or often higher accuracy values than full-graph training ones, showing that mini-batch sampling is not necessarily detrimental to accuracy. Our work highlights the importance of comparing systems across different classes, using time-to-accuracy rather than epoch time for performance comparison, and selecting appropriate hyperparameters for each training method separately.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 Figures, 8 Tables, 1 appendix, Graph Neural Network, Graph Neural Networks, Full-graph training, Mini-batch training, full-batch training, distributed training, performance, epoch time, time to accuracy, accuracy</p></details> |

However, current AMP classification methods, primarily relying on sequence-based data, neglect the spatial structure of peptides, thereby limiting the accurate classification of AMPs. Additionally, the number of known AMPs is significantly lower than that of non-AMPs, leading to imbalanced datasets that reduce predictive accuracy for AMPs. To alleviate these two limitations, we first employ Omegafold to predict the three-dimensional spatial structures of AMPs and non-AMPs, constructing peptide graphs based on the amino acids' C$_\alpha$ positions. Building upon this, we propose a novel classification model named Spatial GNN-based AMP Classifier (SGAC). Our SGAC model employs a graph encoder based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to process peptide graphs, generating high-dimensional representations that capture essential features from the three-dimensional spatial structure of amino acids. Then, to address the inherent imbalanced datasets, SGAC first incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning, which clusters similar peptides while ensuring separation between dissimilar ones, using weighted contributions to emphasize AMP-specific features. Furthermore, SGAC employs Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to dynamically generate high-confidence pseudo labels for ambiguous peptides, further refining predictions and promoting balanced learning between AMPs and non-AMPs. Experiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that SGAC significantly outperforms traditional sequence-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among graph-based models, validating its effectiveness in AMP classification.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a robust framework for analyzing large-scale signaling pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, yet they face limitations in expressivity when capturing intricate biological relationships. To address this, we propose Graph Sequence Language Model (GraphSeqLM), a framework that enhances GNNs with biological sequence embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). These embeddings encode structural and biological properties of DNA, RNA, and proteins, augmenting GNNs with enriched features for analyzing sample-specific multi-omic data. By integrating topological, sequence-derived, and biological information, GraphSeqLM demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and outperforms existing methods, paving the way for more effective multi-omic data integration in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, GNNs' predictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so it is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the downstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph prompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data leakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can infer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data (publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking the raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference attacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference capabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named ProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the graph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference attack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional disentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant knowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack capabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

However, existing GC methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation (FGC) for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for FGC, where we decouple the typical gradient matching process for GC into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching, integrating knowledge from multiple clients' subgraphs into one smaller condensed graph. Nevertheless, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during federated training can be utilized to steal training data under the membership inference attack (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the FGC, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that our framework consistently protects membership privacy during training.

| **[Pre-training Graph Neural Networks on Molecules by Using Subgraph-Conditioned Graph Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15589v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to build a pre-trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) model on molecules without human annotations or prior knowledge. Although various attempts have been proposed to overcome limitations in acquiring labeled molecules, the previous pre-training methods still rely on semantic subgraphs, i.e., functional groups. Only focusing on the functional groups could overlook the graph-level distinctions. The key challenge to build a pre-trained GNN on molecules is how to (1) generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and (2) automatically discover the functional groups without prior knowledge. To solve it, we propose a novel Subgraph-conditioned Graph Information Bottleneck, named S-CGIB, for pre-training GNNs to recognize core subgraphs (graph cores) and significant subgraphs. The main idea is that the graph cores contain compressed and sufficient information that could generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and reconstruct the input graph conditioned on significant subgraphs across molecules under the S-CGIB principle. To discover significant subgraphs without prior knowledge about functional groups, we propose generating a set of functional group candidates, i.e., ego networks, and using an attention-based interaction between the graph core and the candidates. Despite being identified from self-supervised learning, our learned subgraphs match the real-world functional groups. Extensive experiments on molecule datasets across various domains demonstrate the superiority of S-CGIB.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, imperfect graph structure with noisy links lacks enough robustness and may damage graph representations, therefore limiting the GNNs' performance in practical tasks. Moreover, existing generative architectures fail to fit discriminative graph-related tasks. To tackle these issues, we introduce an unsupervised method based on a joint of generative training and discriminative training to learn graph structure and representation, aiming to improve the discriminative performance of generative models. We propose an Energy-based Contrastive Learning (ECL) guided Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) framework, denoted as ECL-GSR. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine energy-based models with contrastive learning for GSR. Specifically, we leverage ECL to approximate the joint distribution of sample pairs, which increases the similarity between representations of positive pairs while reducing the similarity between negative ones. Refined structure is produced by augmenting and removing edges according to the similarity metrics among node representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECL-GSR outperforms \textit{the state-of-the-art on eight benchmark datasets} in node classification. ECL-GSR achieves \textit{faster training with fewer samples and memories} against the leading baseline, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency in downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[X-MeshGraphNet: Scalable Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks for Physics Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17164v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet designed to address these challenges. X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs custom graphs directly from tessellated geometry files (e.g., STLs) by generating point clouds on the surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous, allowing for efficient long-range interactions. Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Heterogeneous Graph Condensation via Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16250v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient training of large-scale heterogeneous graphs is of paramount importance in real-world applications. However, existing approaches typically explore simplified models to mitigate resource and time overhead, neglecting the crucial aspect of simplifying large-scale heterogeneous graphs from the data-centric perspective. Addressing this gap, HGCond introduces graph condensation (GC) in heterogeneous graphs and generates a small condensed graph for efficient model training. Despite its efficacy in graph generation, HGCond encounters two significant limitations. The first is low effectiveness, HGCond excessively relies on the simplest relay model for the condensation procedure, which restricts the ability to exert powerful Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with flexible condensation ratio and limits the generalization ability. The second is low efficiency, HGCond follows the existing GC methods designed for homogeneous graphs and leverages the sophisticated optimization paradigm, resulting in a time-consuming condensing procedure. In light of these challenges, we present the first Training \underline{Free} Heterogeneous Graph Condensation method, termed FreeHGC, facilitating both efficient and high-quality generation of heterogeneous condensed graphs. Specifically, we reformulate the heterogeneous graph condensation problem as a data selection issue, offering a new perspective for assessing and condensing representative nodes and edges in the heterogeneous graphs. By leveraging rich meta-paths, we introduce a new, high-quality heterogeneous data selection criterion to select target-type nodes. Furthermore, two training-free condensation strategies for heterogeneous graphs are designed to condense and synthesize other-types nodes effectively.</p></details> |  |

The proposed abstraction is based on spatial relationships in environments where direct communication between agents is not allowed, leveraging the ubiquity of spatial reasoning in real-world multi-agent scenarios. We introduce MARC (Multi-Agent Relational Critic), a simple yet effective critic architecture incorporating spatial relational inductive biases by transforming the state into a spatial graph and processing it through a relational graph neural network. The performance of MARC is evaluated across six collaborative tasks, including a novel environment with heterogeneous agents. We conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, comparing MARC against state-of-the-art MARL baselines, demonstrating improvements in both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, as well as its potential for generalization. Our findings suggest that a minimal integration of spatial relational inductive biases as abstraction can yield substantial benefits without requiring complex designs or task-specific engineering. This work provides insights into the potential of relational state abstraction to address sample efficiency, a key challenge in MARL, offering a promising direction for developing more efficient algorithms in spatially complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Concept Drift in Windows Malware Detection: Adaptation to Real Drifted Malware with Minimal Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13918v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In applying deep learning for malware classification, it is crucial to account for the prevalence of malware evolution, which can cause trained classifiers to fail on drifted malware. Existing solutions to address concept drift use active learning. They select new samples for analysts to label and then retrain the classifier with the new labels. Our key finding is that the current retraining techniques do not achieve optimal results. These techniques overlook that updating the model with scarce drifted samples requires learning features that remain consistent across pre-drift and post-drift data. The model should thus be able to disregard specific features that, while beneficial for the classification of pre-drift data, are absent in post-drift data, thereby preventing prediction degradation. In this paper, we propose a new technique for detecting and classifying drifted malware that learns drift-invariant features in malware control flow graphs by leveraging graph neural networks with adversarial domain adaptation. We compare it with existing model retraining methods in active learning-based malware detection systems and other domain adaptation techniques from the vision domain. Our approach significantly improves drifted malware detection on publicly available benchmarks and real-world malware databases reported daily by security companies in 2024. We also tested our approach in predicting multiple malware families drifted over time. A thorough evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite. Our work marks a step toward streamlining ML-driven NMR predictions for both static and dynamic behavior of complex materials, and toward bridging the gap between first-principles modeling and real-world experimental data.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LLMs as Zero-shot Graph Learners: Alignment of GNN Representations with LLM Token Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14512v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Linear Algebra: A Graph Neural Network Approach to Preconditioner Design for Conjugate Gradient Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15557v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large linear systems are ubiquitous in modern computational science and engineering. The main recipe for solving them is the use of Krylov subspace iterative methods with well-designed preconditioners. Deep learning models can be used as nonlinear preconditioners during the iteration of linear solvers such as the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Neural network models require an enormous number of parameters to approximate well in this setup. Another approach is to take advantage of small graph neural networks (GNNs) to construct preconditioners with predefined sparsity patterns. Recently, GNNs have been shown to be a promising tool for designing preconditioners to reduce the overall computational cost of iterative methods by constructing them more efficiently than with classical linear algebra techniques. However, preconditioners designed with these approaches cannot outperform those designed with classical methods in terms of the number of iterations in CG. In our work, we recall well-established preconditioners from linear algebra and use them as a starting point for training the GNN to obtain preconditioners that reduce the condition number of the system more significantly. Numerical experiments show that our approach outperforms both classical and neural network-based methods for an important class of parametric partial differential equations. We also provide a heuristic justification for the loss function used and show that preconditioners obtained by learning with this loss function reduce the condition number in a more desirable way for CG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Erase then Rectify: A Training-Free Parameter Editing Approach for Cost-Effective Graph Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16684v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning, which aims to eliminate the influence of specific nodes, edges, or attributes from a trained Graph Neural Network (GNN), is essential in applications where privacy, bias, or data obsolescence is a concern. However, existing graph unlearning techniques often necessitate additional training on the remaining data, leading to significant computational costs, particularly with large-scale graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training-free approach, Erase then Rectify (ETR), designed for efficient and scalable graph unlearning while preserving the model utility. Specifically, we first build a theoretical foundation showing that masking parameters critical for unlearned samples enables effective unlearning. Building on this insight, the Erase stage strategically edits model parameters to eliminate the impact of unlearned samples and their propagated influence on intercorrelated nodes. To further ensure the GNN's utility, the Rectify stage devises a gradient approximation method to estimate the model's gradient on the remaining dataset, which is then used to enhance model performance. Overall, ETR achieves graph unlearning without additional training or full training data access, significantly reducing computational overhead and preserving data privacy. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of ETR in model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning effectiveness, establishing it as a promising solution for real-world graph unlearning challenges.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

To this end, we propose Answer Set Networks (ASN), a NeSy solver. Based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), ASNs are a scalable approach to ASP-based Deep Probabilistic Logic Programming (DPPL). Specifically, we show how to translate ASPs into ASNs and demonstrate how ASNs can efficiently solve the encoded problem by leveraging GPU's batching and parallelization capabilities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that ASNs outperform state-of-the-art CPU-bound NeSy systems on multiple tasks. Simultaneously, we make the following two contributions based on the strengths of ASNs. Namely, we are the first to show the finetuning of Large Language Models (LLM) with DPPLs, employing ASNs to guide the training with logic. Further, we show the "constitutional navigation" of drones, i.e., encoding public aviation laws in an ASN for routing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in uncertain environments.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

The dataset encompasses data from a material removal simulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental results show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error prediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling spatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a low number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector Machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothness Really Matters: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11654v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/cwei01/TDSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, Accpected by AAAI2025</p></details> |

Traditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize local and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and over-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph Transformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global receptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of structural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained token-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which generates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural information and explore global information at different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks consisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and contextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information coverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the Self-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the length and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these expressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node representations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the capability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Current defensive methods require substituting the original GNNs with defense models, regardless of the original's type. This approach, while targeting adversarial robustness, compromises the enhancements developed in prior research to boost GNNs' practical performance. Here we introduce Grimm, the first plug-and-play defense model. With just a minimal interface requirement for extracting features from any layer of the protected GNNs, Grimm is thus enabled to seamlessly rectify perturbations. Specifically, we utilize the feature trajectories (FTs) generated by GNNs, as they evolve through epochs, to reflect the training status of the networks. We then theoretically prove that the FTs of victim nodes will inevitably exhibit discriminable anomalies. Consequently, inspired by the natural parallelism between the biological nervous and immune systems, we construct Grimm, a comprehensive artificial immune system for GNNs. Grimm not only detects abnormal FTs and rectifies adversarial edges during training but also operates efficiently in parallel, thereby mirroring the concurrent functionalities of its biological counterparts. We experimentally confirm that Grimm offers four empirically validated advantages: 1) Harmlessness, as it does not actively interfere with GNN training; 2) Parallelism, ensuring monitoring, detection, and rectification functions operate independently of the GNN training process; 3) Generalizability, demonstrating compatibility with mainstream GNNs such as GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE; and 4) Transferability, as the detectors for abnormal FTs can be efficiently transferred across different systems for one-step rectification.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

Nevertheless, the structure incompleteness, noise, and redundancy result in poor robustness for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs). Dynamic Graph Structure Learning (DGSL) offers a promising way to optimize graph structures. However, aside from encountering unacceptable quadratic complexity, it overly relies on heuristic priors, making it hard to discover underlying predictive patterns. How to efficiently refine the dynamic structures, capture intrinsic dependencies, and learn robust representations, remains under-explored. In this work, we propose the novel DG-Mamba, a robust and efficient Dynamic Graph structure learning framework with the Selective State Space Models (Mamba). To accelerate the spatio-temporal structure learning, we propose a kernelized dynamic message-passing operator that reduces the quadratic time complexity to linear. To capture global intrinsic dynamics, we establish the dynamic graph as a self-contained system with State Space Model. By discretizing the system states with the cross-snapshot graph adjacency, we enable the long-distance dependencies capturing with the selective snapshot scan. To endow learned dynamic structures more expressive with informativeness, we propose the self-supervised Principle of Relevant Information for DGSL to regularize the most relevant yet least redundant information, enhancing global robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the robustness and efficiency of our DG-Mamba compared with the state-of-the-art baselines against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2025)</p></details> |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. \textit{IO drivers}, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named \texttt{IOHunter}, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in \emph{supervised}, \emph{scarcely-supervised}, and \emph{cross-IO} contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches.

These enhancements, while improving the model's performance, often come at the cost of a substantial increase in the number of parameters. By applying the Trainable Adaptive Activation Function Structure (TAAFS), we introduce a method that selects distinct mathematical formulations for non-linear activations, thereby increasing the precision of NNFFs with an insignificant addition to the parameter count. In this study, we integrate TAAFS into a variety of neural network models, resulting in observed accuracy improvements, and further validate these enhancements through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using DeepMD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Scalable and Deep Graph Neural Networks via Noise Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14602v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many graph mining tasks. However, scaling them to large graphs is challenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature propagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly employed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only executes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these receptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for better performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, these methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly focus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting the crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the data-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second, pre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time, especially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present random walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with the existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of deeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous model-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise existing inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the efficient masking mechanism to eliminate them. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that model-simplification works equipped with RMask yield superior performance compared to their original version and can make a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, can result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based method for reconstructing conflict graphs. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, control parameters, and KPIs. Our experimental results validate our proposed method for reconstructing conflict graphs and identifying all types of conflicts in O-RAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," where restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge and enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</p></details> |  |

Many existing methods model this through a multimodal user-item graph, approaching multimodal recommendation as a graph learning task. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in this domain. Prior research has capitalized on GNNs' capability to capture neighborhood information within certain receptive fields (typically denoted by the number of hops, $K$) to enrich user and item semantics. We observe that the optimal receptive fields for GNNs can vary across different modalities. In this paper, we propose GNNs with Modality-Independent Receptive Fields, which employ separate GNNs with independent receptive fields for different modalities to enhance performance. Our results indicate that the optimal $K$ for certain modalities on specific datasets can be as low as 1 or 2, which may restrict the GNNs' capacity to capture global information. To address this, we introduce a Sampling-based Global Transformer, which utilizes uniform global sampling to effectively integrate global information for GNNs. We conduct comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods.

Although previous methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can achieve impressive results, they lack fidelity and efficiency. Recent methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved rendering quality and real-time performance but still require significant storage overhead. In this paper, we introduce a method called GraphAvatar that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to generate 3D Gaussians for the head avatar. Specifically, GraphAvatar trains a geometric GNN and an appearance GNN to generate the attributes of the 3D Gaussians from the tracked mesh. Therefore, our method can store the GNN models instead of the 3D Gaussians, significantly reducing the storage overhead to just 10MB. To reduce the impact of face-tracking errors, we also present a novel graph-guided optimization module to refine face-tracking parameters during training.

| **[Towards Precise Prediction Uncertainty in GNNs: Refining GNNs with Topology-grouping Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14223v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have highlighted the critical need of calibrating model predictions, with neighborhood prediction similarity recognized as a pivotal component. Existing studies suggest that nodes with analogous neighborhood prediction similarity often exhibit similar calibration characteristics. Building on this insight, recent approaches incorporate neighborhood similarity into node-wise temperature scaling techniques. However, our analysis reveals that this assumption does not hold universally. Calibration errors can differ significantly even among nodes with comparable neighborhood similarity, depending on their confidence levels. This necessitates a re-evaluation of existing GNN calibration methods, as a single, unified approach may lead to sub-optimal calibration. In response, we introduce **Simi-Mailbox**, a novel approach that categorizes nodes by both neighborhood similarity and their own confidence, irrespective of proximity or connectivity. Our method allows fine-grained calibration by employing *group-specific* temperature scaling, with each temperature tailored to address the specific miscalibration level of affiliated nodes, rather than adhering to a uniform trend based on neighborhood similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our **Simi-Mailbox** across diverse datasets on different GNN architectures, achieving up to 13.79\% error reduction compared to uncalibrated GNN predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Coarsening via Supervised Granular-Ball for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13842v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant achievements in processing graph data, yet scalability remains a substantial challenge. To address this, numerous graph coarsening methods have been developed. However, most existing coarsening methods are training-dependent, leading to lower efficiency, and they all require a predefined coarsening rate, lacking an adaptive approach. In this paper, we employ granular-ball computing to effectively compress graph data. We construct a coarsened graph network by iteratively splitting the graph into granular-balls based on a purity threshold and using these granular-balls as super vertices. This granulation process significantly reduces the size of the original graph, thereby greatly enhancing the training efficiency and scalability of GNNs. Additionally, our algorithm can adaptively perform splitting without requiring a predefined coarsening rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to training on the original graph. Noise injection experiments further indicate that our method exhibits robust performance. Moreover, our approach can reduce the graph size by up to 20 times without compromising test accuracy, substantially enhancing the scalability of GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoSGNN: Automatic Propagation Mechanism Discovery for Spectral Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12483v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for processing diverse types of graphs. However, a single GNN often struggles to handle different graph types-such as homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs-simultaneously. This challenge has led to the manual design of GNNs tailored to specific graph types, but these approaches are limited by the high cost of labor and the constraints of expert knowledge, which cannot keep up with the rapid growth of graph data. To overcome these challenges, we propose AutoSGNN, an automated framework for discovering propagation mechanisms in spectral GNNs. AutoSGNN unifies the search space for spectral GNNs by integrating large language models with evolutionary strategies to automatically generate architectures that adapt to various graph types. Extensive experiments on nine widely-used datasets, encompassing both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that AutoSGNN outperforms state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and graph neural architecture search methods in both performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Recently, a specially-designed learning scheme, known as Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), shows unique potential for the improvement of model accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. Here we propose the first non-trivial Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Graph Neural Networks (KA-GNNs), including KAN-based graph convolutional networks(KA-GCN) and KAN-based graph attention network (KA-GAT). The essential idea is to utilizes KAN's unique power to optimize GNN architectures at three major levels, including node embedding, message passing, and readout. Further, with the strong approximation capability of Fourier series, we develop Fourier series-based KAN model and provide a rigorous mathematical prove of the robust approximation capability of this Fourier KAN architecture. To validate our KA-GNNs, we consider seven most-widely-used benchmark datasets for molecular property prediction and extensively compare with existing state-of-the-art models. It has been found that our KA-GNNs can outperform traditional GNN models. More importantly, our Fourier KAN module can not only increase the model accuracy but also reduce the computational time. This work not only highlights the great power of KA-GNNs in molecular property prediction but also provides a novel geometric deep learning framework for the general non-Euclidean data analysis.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.

However, the coordination of multiple experts in existing studies solely relies on the weights assigned by the simple router function. Lack of communication and collaboration among experts exacerbate the instability of LLMs due to the imbalance load problem of MoE. To address this issue, we propose a novel MoE graph-based LLM fine-tuning framework GraphLoRA, in which a graph router function is designed to capture the collaboration signals among experts by graph neural networks (GNNs). GraphLoRA enables all experts to understand input knowledge and share information from neighbor experts by aggregating operations. Besides, to enhance each expert's capability and their collaborations, we design two novel coordination strategies: the Poisson distribution-based distinction strategy and the Normal distribution-based load balance strategy. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphLoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs, showing the benefits of facilitating collaborations of multiple experts in the graph router of GraphLoRA.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Enhancing Persona Classification in Dialogue Systems: A Graph Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13283v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) gain considerable attention for their potential to enhance personalized experiences in virtual assistants and chatbots. A key area of interest is the integration of personas into LLMs to improve dialogue naturalness and user engagement. This study addresses the challenge of persona classification, a crucial component in dialogue understanding, by proposing a framework that combines text embeddings with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for effective persona classification. Given the absence of dedicated persona classification datasets, we create a manually annotated dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. Our method involves extracting semantic features from persona statements using text embeddings and constructing a graph where nodes represent personas and edges capture their similarities. The GNN component uses this graph structure to propagate relevant information, thereby improving classification performance. Experimental results show that our approach, in particular the integration of GNNs, significantly improves classification performance, especially with limited data. Our contributions include the development of a persona classification framework and the creation of a dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Internet of Things Security throughSelf-Supervised Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13240v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring the security of IoT devices has become essential. One of the primary challenges in this field is that new types of attacks often have significantly fewer samples than more common attacks, leading to unbalanced datasets. Existing research on detecting intrusions in these unbalanced labeled datasets primarily employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or conventional Machine Learning (ML) models, which result in incomplete detection, especially for new attacks. To handle these challenges, we suggest a new approach to IoT intrusion detection using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with a Markov Graph Convolutional Network (MarkovGCN). Graph learning excels at modeling complex relationships within data, while SSL mitigates the issue of limited labeled data for emerging attacks. Our approach leverages the inherent structure of IoT networks to pre-train a GCN, which is then fine-tuned for the intrusion detection task. The integration of Markov chains in GCN uncovers network structures and enriches node and edge features with contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and robustness compared to conventional supervised learning methods. Using the EdgeIIoT-set dataset, we attained an accuracy of 98.68\%, a precision of 98.18%, a recall of 98.35%, and an F1-Score of 98.40%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cluster-guided Contrastive Class-imbalanced Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12984v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of class-imbalanced graph classification, which aims at effectively classifying the categories of graphs in scenarios with imbalanced class distribution. Despite the tremendous success of graph neural networks (GNNs), their modeling ability for imbalanced graph-structured data is inadequate, which typically leads to predictions biased towards the majority classes. Besides, existing class-imbalanced learning methods in visions may overlook the rich graph semantic substructures of the majority classes and excessively emphasize learning from the minority classes. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful approach called C$^3$GNN that incorporates the idea of clustering into contrastive learning to enhance class-imbalanced graph classification. Technically, C$^3$GNN clusters graphs from each majority class into multiple subclasses, ensuring they have similar sizes to the minority class, thus alleviating class imbalance. Additionally, it utilizes the Mixup technique to synthesize new samples and enrich the semantic information of each subclass, and leverages supervised contrastive learning to hierarchically learn effective graph representations. In this way, we can not only sufficiently explore the semantic substructures within the majority class but also effectively alleviate excessive focus on the minority class. Extensive experiments on real-world graph benchmark datasets verify the superior performance of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Proceedings of the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |
| **[Search Strategy Generation for Branch and Bound Using Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09444v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) is an exact method in integer programming that recursively divides the search space into a tree. During the resolution process, determining the next subproblem to explore within the tree-known as the search strategy-is crucial. Hand-crafted heuristics are commonly used, but none are effective over all problem classes. Recent approaches utilizing neural networks claim to make more intelligent decisions but are computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce GP2S (Genetic Programming for Search Strategy), a novel machine learning approach that automatically generates a B\&B search strategy heuristic, aiming to make intelligent decisions while being computationally lightweight. We define a policy as a function that evaluates the quality of a B\&B node by combining features from the node and the problem; the search strategy policy is then defined by a best-first search based on this node ranking. The policy space is explored using a genetic programming algorithm, and the policy that achieves the best performance on a training set is selected. We compare our approach with the standard method of the SCIP solver, a recent graph neural network-based method, and handcrafted heuristics. Our first evaluation includes three types of primal hard problems, tested on instances similar to the training set and on larger instances. Our method is at most 2\% slower than the best baseline and consistently outperforms SCIP, achieving an average speedup of 11.3\%. Additionally, GP2S is tested on the MIPLIB 2017 dataset, generating multiple heuristics from different subsets of instances. It exceeds SCIP's average performance in 7 out of 10 cases across 15 times more instances and under a time limit 15 times longer, with some GP2S methods leading on most experiments in terms of the number of feasible solutions or optimality gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Effective Graph Rationalization via Boosting Environment Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12880v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform effectively when training and testing graphs are drawn from the same distribution, but struggle to generalize well in the face of distribution shifts. To address this issue, existing mainstreaming graph rationalization methods first identify rationale and environment subgraphs from input graphs, and then diversify training distributions by augmenting the environment subgraphs. However, these methods merely combine the learned rationale subgraphs with environment subgraphs in the representation space to produce augmentation samples, failing to produce sufficiently diverse distributions. Thus, in this paper, we propose to achieve an effective Graph Rationalization by Boosting Environmental diversity, a GRBE approach that generates the augmented samples in the original graph space to improve the diversity of the environment subgraph. Firstly, to ensure the effectiveness of augmentation samples, we propose a precise rationale subgraph extraction strategy in GRBE to refine the rationale subgraph learning process in the original graph space. Secondly, to ensure the diversity of augmented samples, we propose an environment diversity augmentation strategy in GRBE that mixes the environment subgraphs of different graphs in the original graph space and then combines the new environment subgraphs with rationale subgraphs to generate augmented graphs. The average improvements of 7.65% and 6.11% in rationalization and classification performance on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GRBE over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16822v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v5)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human understandable. By considering prominent GNN architectures (e.g., GAT and GraphSAGE) for anomaly detection tasks, we show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the fidelity+/fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, and we incorporate the precision/recall metric where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth. On malware and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25% higher fidelity+, precision and recall, and 12% lower fidelity- respectively, compared to SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |

While the data-driven models investigate affordances of single or paired objects, there is a gap in the exploration of affordances of compound objects composed of an arbitrary number of objects. We propose the Multi-Object Graph Affordance Network which models complex compound object affordances by learning the outcomes of robot actions that facilitate interactions between an object and a compound. Given the depth images of the objects, the object features are extracted via convolution operations and encoded in the nodes of graph neural networks. Graph convolution operations are used to encode the state of the compounds, which are used as input to decoders to predict the outcome of the object-compound interactions. After learning the compound object affordances, given different tasks, the learned outcome predictors are used to plan sequences of stack actions that involve stacking objects on top of each other, inserting smaller objects into larger containers and passing through ring-like objects through poles. We showed that our system successfully modeled the affordances of compound objects that include concave and convex objects, in both simulated and real-world environments. We benchmarked our system with a baseline model to highlight its advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[ST-FiT: Inductive Spatial-Temporal Forecasting with Limited Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10912v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graphs are widely used in a variety of real-world applications. Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to extract meaningful insights from this data. However, in real-world applications, most nodes may not possess any available temporal data during training. For example, the pandemic dynamics of most cities on a geographical graph may not be available due to the asynchronous nature of outbreaks. Such a phenomenon disagrees with the training requirements of most existing spatial-temporal forecasting methods, which jeopardizes their effectiveness and thus blocks broader deployment. In this paper, we propose to formulate a novel problem of inductive forecasting with limited training data. In particular, given a spatial-temporal graph, we aim to learn a spatial-temporal forecasting model that can be easily generalized onto those nodes without any available temporal training data. To handle this problem, we propose a principled framework named ST-FiT. ST-FiT consists of two key learning components: temporal data augmentation and spatial graph topology learning. With such a design, ST-FiT can be used on top of any existing STGNNs to achieve superior performance on the nodes without training data. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-FiT in multiple key perspectives.</p></details> |  |

The core of this new graph learning paradigm lies in the synergistic combination of GNNs' ability to capture complex structural relationships and LLMs' proficiency in understanding informative contexts from the rich textual descriptions of graphs. Therefore, we can leverage graph description texts with rich semantic context to fundamentally enhance Data quality, thereby improving the representational capacity of model-centric approaches in line with data-centric machine learning principles. By leveraging the strengths of these distinct neural network architectures, this integrated approach addresses a wide range of TAG-based Task (e.g., graph learning, graph reasoning, and graph question answering), particularly in complex industrial scenarios (e.g., supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings). In other words, we can treat text as a medium to enable cross-domain generalization of graph learning Model, allowing a single graph model to effectively handle the diversity of downstream graph-based Task across different data domains. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners looking to advance graph learning methodologies in the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM.

These nodes are called Structural Hole Spanners (SHS). Numerous solutions are proposed to discover SHSs; however, most of the solutions are only applicable to static networks. Since real-world networks are dynamic networks; consequently, in this study, we aim to discover SHSs in dynamic networks. Discovering SHSs is an NP-hard problem, due to which, instead of discovering exact k SHSs, we adopt a greedy approach to discover Top-k SHSs. We first propose an efficient Tracking-SHS algorithm for updating SHSs in dynamic networks. Our algorithm reuses the information obtained during the initial runs of the static algorithm and avoids the recomputations for the nodes unaffected by the updates. Besides, motivated from the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on various graph mining problems, we also design a Graph Neural Network-based model, GNN-SHS, to discover SHSs in dynamic networks, aiming to reduce the computational cost while achieving high accuracy. We provide a theoretical analysis of the Tracking-SHS algorithm, and our theoretical results prove that for a particular type of graphs, such as Preferential Attachment graphs [1], Tracking-SHS algorithm achieves 1.6 times of speedup compared with the static algorithm. We perform extensive experiments, and our results demonstrate that the Tracking-SHS algorithm attains a minimum of 3.24 times speedup over the static algorithm. Also, the proposed second model GNN-SHS is on an average 671.6 times faster than the Tracking-SHS algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.08239t I have updates significant portions of the draft and corrected a few mistakes in the paper</p></details> |

In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to machine learning techniques to address this problem. They have developed methods to learn the underlying diffusion processes in a data-driven manner, which enhances the generalizability of the solution, and have designed optimization objectives to identify the optimal seed set. Nonetheless, two fundamental gaps remain unsolved: (1) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used to learn diffusion models, but in their traditional form, they often fail to capture the complex dynamics of influence diffusion, (2) Designing optimization objectives is challenging due to combinatorial explosion when solving this problem. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, DeepSN. Our framework employs sheaf neural diffusion to learn diverse influence patterns in a data-driven, end-to-end manner, providing enhanced separability in capturing diffusion characteristics. We also propose an optimization technique that accounts for overlapping influence between vertices, which helps to reduce the search space and identify the optimal seed set effectively and efficiently. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
