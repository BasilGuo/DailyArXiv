| **[Identifying Nonstationary Causal Structures with High-Order Markov Switching Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17698v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time series is a rapidly evolving field with a wide variety of applications in other areas such as climate science and neuroscience. Traditional approaches assume a stationary causal graph, which can be adapted to nonstationary time series with time-dependent effects or heterogeneous noise. In this work we address nonstationarity via regime-dependent causal structures. We first establish identifiability for high-order Markov Switching Models, which provide the foundations for identifiable regime-dependent causal discovery. Our empirical studies demonstrate the scalability of our proposed approach for high-order regime-dependent structure estimation, and we illustrate its applicability on brain activity data.</p></details> | <details><summary>CI4TS...</summary><p>CI4TS Workshop @UAI2024</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Modal Conformal Prediction Regions with Simple Structures by Optimizing Convex Shape Templates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07434v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions for machine learning models that are valid with high probability. A key component of conformal prediction algorithms is a \emph{non-conformity score function} that quantifies how different a model's prediction is from the unknown ground truth value. Essentially, these functions determine the shape and the size of the conformal prediction regions. While prior work has gone into creating score functions that produce multi-model prediction regions, such regions are generally too complex for use in downstream planning and control problems. We propose a method that optimizes parameterized \emph{shape template functions} over calibration data, which results in non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions with minimum volume. Our approach results in prediction regions that are \emph{multi-modal}, so they can properly capture residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and \emph{practical}, so each region is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous vehicles, showing an up to $68\%$ reduction in prediction region area compared to a circular baseline region.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to L4DC 2024. 14 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17627v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to ensure autonomous vehicles are safe for on-road deployment, simulation-based testing has become an integral complement to on-road testing. The rise in simulation testing and validation reflects a growing need to verify that AV behavior is consistent with desired outcomes even in edge case scenarios $-$ which may seldom or never appear in on-road testing data. This raises a critical question: to what extent are AV failures in simulation consistent with data collected from real-world testing? As a result of the gap between simulated and real sensor data (sim-to-real gap), failures in simulation can either be spurious (simulation- or simulator-specific issues) or relevant (safety-critical AV system issues). One possible method for validating if simulated time series failures are consistent with real world time series sensor data could involve retrieving instances of the failure scenario from a real-world time series dataset, in order to understand AV performance in these scenarios. Adopting this strategy, we propose a formal definition of what constitutes a match between a real-world labeled time series data item and a simulated scenario written from a fragment of the Scenic probabilistic programming language for simulation generation. With this definition of a match, we develop a querying algorithm that identifies the subset of a labeled time series dataset matching a given scenario. To allow this approach to be used to verify the safety of other cyber-physical systems (CPS), we present a definition and algorithm for matching scalable beyond the autonomous vehicles domain. Experiments demonstrate the precision and scalability of the algorithm for a set of challenging and uncommon time series scenarios identified from the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset. We include a full system implementation of the querying algorithm freely available for use across a wide range of CPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 6 figures, 5 algorithms.

| **[Continuous Urban Change Detection from Satellite Image Time Series with Temporal Feature Refinement and Multi-Task Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17458v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urbanization advances at unprecedented rates, resulting in negative effects on the environment and human well-being. Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series. Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution satellite image time series acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems via Causal Discovery from Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09871v3)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online unsupervised detection of anomalies is crucial to guarantee the correct operation of cyber-physical systems and the safety of humans interacting with them. State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of >10 different anomalies. The code is at https://github.com/Isla-lab/causal_anomaly_detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pu...</summary><p>In publication for IEEE Conference on Automation and Smart Engineering (CASE) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Development of a digital tool for monitoring the behaviour of pre-weaned calves using accelerometer neck-collars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17352v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic monitoring of calf behaviour is a promising way of assessing animal welfare from their first week on farms. This study aims to (i) develop machine learning models from accelerometer data to classify the main behaviours of pre-weaned calves and (ii) set up a digital tool for monitoring the behaviour of pre-weaned calves from the models' prediction. Thirty pre-weaned calves were equipped with a 3-D accelerometer attached to a neck-collar for two months and filmed simultaneously. The behaviours were annotated, resulting in 27.4 hours of observation aligned with the accelerometer data. The time-series were then split into 3 seconds windows. Two machine learning models were tuned using data from 80% of the calves: (i) a Random Forest model to classify between active and inactive behaviours using a set of 11 hand-craft features [model 1] and (ii) a RidgeClassifierCV model to classify between lying, running, drinking milk and other behaviours using ROCKET features [model 2]. The performance of the models was tested using data from the remaining 20% of the calves. Model 1 achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.92. Model 2 achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.84. Behavioural metrics such as daily activity ratio and episodes of running, lying, drinking milk, and other behaviours expressed over time were deduced from the predictions. All the development was finally embedded into a Python dashboard so that the individual calf metrics could be displayed directly from the raw accelerometer files.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distillation Enhanced Time Series Forecasting Network with Momentum Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17802v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive representation learning is crucial in time series analysis as it alleviates the issue of data noise and incompleteness as well as sparsity of supervision signal. However, existing constrastive learning frameworks usually focus on intral-temporal features, which fails to fully exploit the intricate nature of time series data. To address this issue, we propose DE-TSMCL, an innovative distillation enhanced framework for long sequence time series forecasting. Specifically, we design a learnable data augmentation mechanism which adaptively learns whether to mask a timestamp to obtain optimized sub-sequences. Then, we propose a contrastive learning task with momentum update to explore inter-sample and intra-temporal correlations of time series to learn the underlying structure feature on the unlabeled time series. Meanwhile, we design a supervised task to learn more robust representations and facilitate the contrastive learning process. Finally, we jointly optimize the above two tasks. By developing model loss from multiple tasks, we can learn effective representations for downstream forecasting task. Extensive experiments, in comparison with state-of-the-arts, well demonstrate the effectiveness of DE-TSMCL, where the maximum improvement can reach to 27.3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-class Temporal Logic Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12397v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data can represent the behaviors of autonomous systems, such as drones and self-driving cars. The task of binary and multi-class classification for time-series data has become a prominent area of research. Neural networks represent a popular approach to classifying data; However, they lack interpretability, which poses a significant challenge in extracting meaningful information from them. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formalism that describes the properties of timed behaviors. We propose a method that combines all of the above: neural networks that represent STL specifications for multi-class classification of time-series data. We offer two key contributions: 1) We introduce a notion of margin for multi-class classification, and 2) we introduce STL-based attributes for enhancing the interpretability of the results. We evaluate our method on two datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Influence of Nuisance Parameter Uncertainty on Statistical Inference in Practical Data Science Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15078v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For multiple reasons -- such as avoiding overtraining from one data set or because of having received numerical estimates for some parameters in a model from an alternative source -- it is sometimes useful to divide a model's parameters into one group of primary parameters and one group of nuisance parameters. However, uncertainty in the values of nuisance parameters is an inevitable factor that impacts the model's reliability. This paper examines the issue of uncertainty calculation for primary parameters of interest in the presence of nuisance parameters. We illustrate a general procedure on two distinct model forms: 1) the GARCH time series model with univariate nuisance parameter and 2) multiple hidden layer feed-forward neural network models with multivariate nuisance parameters. Leveraging an existing theoretical framework for nuisance parameter uncertainty, we show how to modify the confidence regions for the primary parameters while considering the inherent uncertainty introduced by nuisance parameters. Furthermore, our study validates the practical effectiveness of adjusted confidence regions that properly account for uncertainty in nuisance parameters. Such an adjustment helps data scientists produce results that more honestly reflect the overall uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Laplacian Convolutional Representation for Traffic Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01529v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal traffic data imputation is of great significance in intelligent transportation systems and data-driven decision-making processes. To perform efficient learning and accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in time series. In the literature, substantial works have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing the low-rank property of traffic data by matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated as a circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the circulant matrix nuclear norm and the Laplacian kernelized temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that has a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in log-linear time complexity. Through extensive experiments on several traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR over several baseline models for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity) and reconstructing sparse speed fields of vehicular traffic flow. The proposed LCR model is also an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing imputation models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Bayesian temporal biclustering with applications to multi-subject neuroscience studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17131v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of analyzing multivariate time series collected on multiple subjects, with the goal of identifying groups of subjects exhibiting similar trends in their recorded measurements over time as well as time-varying groups of associated measurements. To this end, we propose a Bayesian model for temporal biclustering featuring nested partitions, where a time-invariant partition of subjects induces a time-varying partition of measurements. Our approach allows for data-driven determination of the number of subject and measurement clusters as well as estimation of the number and location of changepoints in measurement partitions. To efficiently perform model fitting and posterior estimation with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we derive a blocked update of measurements' cluster-assignment sequences. We illustrate the performance of our model in two applications to functional magnetic resonance imaging data and to an electroencephalogram dataset. The results indicate that the proposed model can combine information from potentially many subjects to discover a set of interpretable, dynamic patterns. Experiments on simulated data compare the estimation performance of the proposed model against ground-truth values and other statistical methods, showing that it performs well at identifying ground-truth subject and measurement clusters even when no subject or time dependence is present.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainMAE: A Region-aware Self-supervised Learning Framework for Brain Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17086v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The human brain is a complex, dynamic network, which is commonly studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and modeled as network of Regions of interest (ROIs) for understanding various brain functions. Recent studies utilize deep learning approaches to learn the brain network representation based on functional connectivity (FC) profile, broadly falling into two main categories. The Fixed-FC approaches, utilizing the FC profile which represents the linear temporal relation within the brain network, are limited by failing to capture informative brain temporal dynamics. On the other hand, the Dynamic-FC approaches, modeling the evolving FC profile over time, often exhibit less satisfactory performance due to challenges in handling the inherent noisy nature of fMRI data. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Masked Auto-Encoder (BrainMAE) for learning representations directly from fMRI time-series data. Our approach incorporates two essential components: a region-aware graph attention mechanism designed to capture the relationships between different brain ROIs, and a novel self-supervised masked autoencoding framework for effective model pre-training. These components enable the model to capture rich temporal dynamics of brain activity while maintaining resilience to inherent noise in fMRI data. Our experiments demonstrate that BrainMAE consistently outperforms established baseline methods by significant margins in four distinct downstream tasks. Finally, leveraging the model's inherent interpretability, our analysis of model-generated representations reveals findings that resonate with ongoing research in the field of neuroscience.</p></details> | 27 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Perceiver-based CDF Modeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01720v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in forecasting time series data. However, their extensive dependence on self-attention mechanisms demands significant computational resources, thereby limiting their practical applicability across diverse tasks, especially in multimodal problems. In this work, we propose a new architecture, called perceiver-CDF, for modeling cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of time series data. Our approach combines the perceiver architecture with a copula-based attention mechanism tailored for multimodal time series prediction. By leveraging the perceiver, our model efficiently transforms high-dimensional and multimodal data into a compact latent space, thereby significantly reducing computational demands. Subsequently, we implement a copula-based attention mechanism to construct the joint distribution of missing data for prediction. Further, we propose an output variance testing mechanism to effectively mitigate error propagation during prediction. To enhance efficiency and reduce complexity, we introduce midpoint inference for the local attention mechanism. This enables the model to efficiently capture dependencies within nearby imputed samples without considering all previous samples. The experiments on the unimodal and multimodal benchmarks consistently demonstrate a 20% improvement over state-of-the-art methods while utilizing less than half of the computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Winter Simulation Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Meta-learning and Data Augmentation for Stress Testing Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17008v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of univariate forecasting models is often hampered by conditions that cause them stress. A model is considered to be under stress if it shows a negative behaviour, such as higher-than-usual errors or increased uncertainty. Understanding the factors that cause stress to forecasting models is important to improve their reliability, transparency, and utility. This paper addresses this problem by contributing with a novel framework called MAST (Meta-learning and data Augmentation for Stress Testing). The proposed approach aims to model and characterize stress in univariate time series forecasting models, focusing on conditions where they exhibit large errors. In particular, MAST is a meta-learning approach that predicts the probability that a given model will perform poorly on a given time series based on a set of statistical time series features. MAST also encompasses a novel data augmentation technique based on oversampling to improve the metadata concerning stress. We conducted experiments using three benchmark datasets that contain a total of 49.794 time series to validate the performance of MAST. The results suggest that the proposed approach is able to identify conditions that lead to large errors. The method and experiments are publicly available in a repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conformal time series decomposition with component-wise exchangeability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16766v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction offers a practical framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees under relatively mild assumptions on data exchangeability. However, these assumptions cease to hold for time series due to their temporally correlated nature. In this work, we present a novel use of conformal prediction for time series forecasting that incorporates time series decomposition. This approach allows us to model different temporal components individually. By applying specific conformal algorithms to each component and then merging the obtained prediction intervals, we customize our methods to account for the different exchangeability regimes underlying each component. Our decomposition-based approach is thoroughly discussed and empirically evaluated on synthetic and real-world data. We find that the method provides promising results on well-structured time series, but can be limited by factors such as the decomposition step for more complex data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COPA 2024; 34 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables (incl. appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Anomaly Detection based on Markov Data: A Statistical Depth Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16759v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is the main purpose of this article to extend the notion of statistical depth to the case of sample paths of a Markov chain, a very popular probabilistic model to describe parsimoniously random phenomena with a temporal causality. Initially introduced to define a center-outward ordering of points in the support of a multivariate distribution, depth functions permit to generalize the notions of quantiles and (signed) ranks for observations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d>1$, as well as statistical procedures based on such quantities, for (unsupervised) anomaly detection tasks in particular. In this paper, overcoming the lack of natural order on the torus composed of all possible trajectories of finite length, we develop a general theoretical framework for evaluating the depth of a Markov sample path and recovering it statistically from an estimate of its transition probability with (non-) asymptotic guarantees. We also detail its numerous applications, focusing particularly on anomaly detection, a key task in various fields involving the analysis of (supposedly) Markov time-series (\textit{e.g.} health monitoring of complex infrastructures, security). Beyond the description of the methodology promoted and the statistical analysis carried out to guarantee its validity, numerical experiments are displayed, providing strong empirical evidence of the relevance of the novel concept we introduce here to quantify the degree of abnormality of Markov path sequences of variable length.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalFormer: An Interpretable Transformer for Temporal Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16708v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal discovery is a crucial task aimed at uncovering the causal relations within time series data. The latest temporal causal discovery methods usually train deep learning models on prediction tasks to uncover the causality between time series. They capture causal relations by analyzing the parameters of some components of the trained models, e.g., attention weights and convolution weights. However, this is an incomplete mapping process from the model parameters to the causality and fails to investigate the other components, e.g., fully connected layers and activation functions, that are also significant for causal discovery. To facilitate the utilization of the whole deep learning models in temporal causal discovery, we proposed an interpretable transformer-based causal discovery model termed CausalFormer, which consists of the causality-aware transformer and the decomposition-based causality detector. The causality-aware transformer learns the causal representation of time series data using a prediction task with the designed multi-kernel causal convolution which aggregates each input time series along the temporal dimension under the temporal priority constraint. Then, the decomposition-based causality detector interprets the global structure of the trained causality-aware transformer with the proposed regression relevance propagation to identify potential causal relations and finally construct the causal graph. Experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CausalFormer on discovering temporal causality. Our code is available at https://github.com/lingbai-kong/CausalFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Inference for Bures-Wasserstein Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13764v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a statistical framework for conducting inference on collections of time-varying covariance operators (covariance flows) over a general, possibly infinite dimensional, Hilbert space. We model the intrinsically non-linear structure of covariances by means of the Bures-Wasserstein metric geometry. We make use of the Riemmanian-like structure induced by this metric to define a notion of mean and covariance of a random flow, and develop an associated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion. We then treat the problem of estimation and construction of functional principal components from a finite collection of covariance flows, observed fully or irregularly. Our theoretical results are motivated by modern problems in functional data analysis, where one observes operator-valued random processes -- for instance when analysing dynamic functional connectivity and fMRI data, or when analysing multiple functional time series in the frequency domain. Nevertheless, our framework is also novel in the finite-dimensions (matrix case), and we demonstrate what simplifications can be afforded then. We illustrate our methodology by means of simulations and data analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Inference on Process Graphs, Part I: The Structural Equation Process Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11561v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When dealing with time series data, causal inference methods often employ structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) processes to model time-evolving random systems. In this work, we rephrase recursive SVAR processes with possible latent component processes as a linear Structural Causal Model (SCM) of stochastic processes on a simple causal graph, the \emph{process graph}, that models every process as a single node. Using this reformulation, we generalise Wright's well-known path-rule for linear Gaussian SCMs to the newly introduced process SCMs and we express the auto-covariance sequence of an SVAR process by means of a generalised trek-rule. Employing the Fourier-Transformation, we derive compact expressions for causal effects in the frequency domain that allow us to efficiently visualise the causal interactions in a multivariate SVAR process. Finally, we observe that the process graph can be used to formulate graphical criteria for identifying causal effects and to derive algebraic relations with which these frequency domain causal effects can be recovered from the observed spectral density.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages.

| **[Detach-ROCKET: Sequential feature selection for time series classification with random convolutional kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14518v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Classification (TSC) is essential in fields like medicine, environmental science, and finance, enabling tasks such as disease diagnosis, anomaly detection, and stock price analysis. While machine learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks and InceptionTime are successful in numerous applications, they can face scalability issues due to computational requirements. Recently, ROCKET has emerged as an efficient alternative, achieving state-of-the-art performance and simplifying training by utilizing a large number of randomly generated features from the time series data. However, many of these features are redundant or non-informative, increasing computational load and compromising generalization. Here we introduce Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD) to identify and prune non-essential features in ROCKET-based models, such as ROCKET, MiniRocket, and MultiRocket. SFD estimates feature importance using model coefficients and can handle large feature sets without complex hyperparameter tuning. Testing on the UCR archive shows that SFD can produce models with better test accuracy using only 10\% of the original features. We named these pruned models Detach-ROCKET. We also present an end-to-end procedure for determining an optimal balance between the number of features and model accuracy. On the largest binary UCR dataset, Detach-ROCKET improves test accuracy by 0.6\% while reducing features by 98.9\%. By enabling a significant reduction in model size without sacrificing accuracy, our methodology improves computational efficiency and contributes to model interpretability. We believe that Detach-ROCKET will be a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working with time series data, who can find a user-friendly implementation of the model at \url{https://github.com/gon-uri/detach_rocket}.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Permutation Entropy for Signal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00964v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shannon Entropy is the preeminent tool for measuring the level of uncertainty (and conversely, information content) in a random variable. In the field of communications, entropy can be used to express the information content of given signals (represented as time series) by considering random variables which sample from specified subsequences. In this paper, we will discuss how an entropy variant, the \textit{permutation entropy} can be used to study and classify radio frequency signals in a noisy environment. The permutation entropy is the entropy of the random variable which samples occurrences of permutation patterns from time series given a fixed window length, making it a function of the distribution of permutation patterns. Since the permutation entropy is a function of the relative order of data, it is (global) amplitude agnostic and thus allows for comparison between signals at different scales. This article is intended to describe a permutation patterns approach to a data driven problem in radio frequency communications research, and includes a primer on all non-permutation pattern specific background. An empirical analysis of the methods herein on radio frequency data is included. No prior knowledge of signals analysis is assumed, and permutation pattern specific notation will be included. This article serves as a self-contained introduction to the relationship between permutation patterns, entropy, and signals analysis for studying radio frequency signals and includes results on a classification task.</p></details> |  |
| **[No More Sliding-Windows: Dynamic Functional Connectivity Based On Random Convolutions Without Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16619v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of dynamic functional connectivity, the sliding-window method is widely used and its stability is generally recognized. However, the sliding-window method's data processing within the window is overly simplistic, which to some extent limits its effectiveness. This study proposes a feature expansion method based on random convolution, which achieves better and more noise-resistant results than the sliding-window method without requiring training. Experiments on simulated data show that the dynamic functional connectivity matrix and time series obtained using the random convolution method have a higher degree of fit (95.59\%) with the standard answers within shorter time windows, compared to the sliding-window method (45.99\%). Gender difference studies on real data also reveal that the random convolution method uncovers more gender differences than the sliding-window method. Through theoretical analysis, we propose a more comprehensive convolutional functional connectivity computation model, with the sliding-window method being a special case of this model, thereby opening up vast potential for research methods in dynamic functional connectivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting with Deep Learning: Beyond Average of Average of Average Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16590v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate evaluation of forecasting models is essential for ensuring reliable predictions. Current practices for evaluating and comparing forecasting models focus on summarising performance into a single score, using metrics such as SMAPE. We hypothesize that averaging performance over all samples dilutes relevant information about the relative performance of models. Particularly, conditions in which this relative performance is different than the overall accuracy. We address this limitation by proposing a novel framework for evaluating univariate time series forecasting models from multiple perspectives, such as one-step ahead forecasting versus multi-step ahead forecasting. We show the advantages of this framework by comparing a state-of-the-art deep learning approach with classical forecasting techniques. While classical methods (e.g. ARIMA) are long-standing approaches to forecasting, deep neural networks (e.g. NHITS) have recently shown state-of-the-art forecasting performance in benchmark datasets. We conducted extensive experiments that show NHITS generally performs best, but its superiority varies with forecasting conditions. For instance, concerning the forecasting horizon, NHITS only outperforms classical approaches for multi-step ahead forecasting. Another relevant insight is that, when dealing with anomalies, NHITS is outperformed by methods such as Theta.

Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art architectures use self-attention mechanisms to process the temporal dimension and convolutions for the spatial dimension of SITS. Motivated by the success of purely attention-based architectures in crop mapping from single-modal SITS, we introduce several multi-modal multi-temporal transformer-based architectures. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of Early Fusion, Cross Attention Fusion and Synchronized Class Token Fusion within the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT). Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art architectures with both convolutional and self-attention components.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[PenSLR: Persian end-to-end Sign Language Recognition Using Ensembling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16388v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a fast-growing field that aims to fill the communication gaps between the hearing-impaired and people without hearing loss. Existing solutions for Persian Sign Language (PSL) are limited to word-level interpretations, underscoring the need for more advanced and comprehensive solutions. Moreover, previous work on other languages mainly focuses on manipulating the neural network architectures or hardware configurations instead of benefiting from the aggregated results of multiple models. In this paper, we introduce PenSLR, a glove-based sign language system consisting of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and five flexible sensors powered by a deep learning framework capable of predicting variable-length sequences. We achieve this in an end-to-end manner by leveraging the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, eliminating the need for segmentation of input signals. To further enhance its capabilities, we propose a novel ensembling technique by leveraging a multiple sequence alignment algorithm known as Star Alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a new PSL dataset, including 16 PSL signs with more than 3000 time-series samples in total. We utilize this dataset to evaluate the performance of our system based on four word-level and sentence-level metrics. Our evaluations show that PenSLR achieves a remarkable word accuracy of 94.58% and 96.70% in subject-independent and subject-dependent setups, respectively. These achievements are attributable to our ensembling algorithm, which not only boosts the word-level performance by 0.51% and 1.32% in the respective scenarios but also yields significant enhancements of 1.46% and 4.00%, respectively, in sentence-level accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing Topological Data Analysis for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16380v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an investigation of how topological data analysis (TDA) can be applied to condition-based monitoring (CBM) of wind turbines for energy generation. TDA is a branch of data analysis focusing on extracting meaningful information from complex datasets by analyzing their structure in state space and computing their underlying topological features. By representing data in a high-dimensional state space, TDA enables the identification of patterns, anomalies, and trends in the data that may not be apparent through traditional signal processing methods. For this study, wind turbine data was acquired from a wind park in Norway via standard vibration sensors at different locations of the turbine's gearbox. Both the vibration acceleration data and its frequency spectra were recorded at infrequent intervals for a few seconds at high frequency and failure events were labelled as either gear-tooth or ball-bearing failures. The data processing and analysis are based on a pipeline where the time series data is first split into intervals and then transformed into multi-dimensional point clouds via a time-delay embedding. The shape of the point cloud is analyzed with topological methods such as persistent homology to generate topology-based key health indicators based on Betti numbers, information entropy and signal persistence. Such indicators are tested for CBM and diagnosis (fault detection) to identify faults in wind turbines and classify them accordingly. Topological indicators are shown to be an interesting alternative for failure identification and diagnosis of operational failures in wind turbines.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Prognostics and Health Management Society Style 2024</p></details> |

Real-world time series datasets are frequently incomplete (or irregular with missing observations), in which case imputation is strongly required. Many different time series imputation methods have been proposed. Recent self-attention-based methods show the state-of-the-art imputation performance. However, it has been overlooked for a long time to design an imputation method based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs), i.e., neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs). To this end, we redesign time series (variational) autoencoders based on NCDEs. Our method, called continuous-time autoencoder (CTA), encodes an input time series sample into a continuous hidden path (rather than a hidden vector) and decodes it to reconstruct and impute the input. In our experiments with 4 datasets and 19 baselines, our method shows the best imputation performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WSDM'24 full paper (oral presentation)</p></details> |

However, since enhancement patterns of renal lesions across CT phases are different even for the same lesion type, the visual assessment by radiologists suffers from inter-observer variability in clinical practice. Although deep learning-based approaches have been recently explored for differential diagnosis of kidney cancer, they do not explicitly model the relationships between CT phases in the network design, limiting the diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lesion-aware cross-phase attention network (LACPANet) that can effectively capture temporal dependencies of renal lesions across CT phases to accurately classify the lesions into five major pathological subtypes from time-series multi-phase CT images. We introduce a 3D inter-phase lesion-aware attention mechanism to learn effective 3D lesion features that are used to estimate attention weights describing the inter-phase relations of the enhancement patterns. We also present a multi-scale attention scheme to capture and aggregate temporal patterns of lesion features at different spatial scales for further improvement. Extensive experiments on multi-phase CT scans of kidney cancer patients from the collected dataset demonstrate that our LACPANet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |
| **[WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11217v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models, including GPT4, Claude3.5, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our rigorous benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738%), RMSE (4.8553%), MAE (3.9991%), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-Free Online Change Detection for Low-Rank Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16136v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a distribution-free CUSUM procedure designed for online change detection in a time series of low-rank images, particularly when the change causes a mean shift. We represent images as matrix data and allow for temporal dependence, in addition to inherent spatial dependence, before and after the change. The marginal distributions are assumed to be general, not limited to any specific parametric distribution. We propose new monitoring statistics that utilize the low-rank structure of the in-control mean matrix. Additionally, we study the properties of the proposed detection procedure, assessing whether the monitoring statistics effectively capture a mean shift and evaluating the rate of increase in average run length relative to the control limit in both in-control and out-of-control cases. The effectiveness of our procedure is demonstrated through simulated and real data experiments.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Database for identifiability properties of linear compartmental models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16132v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural identifiability is an important property of parametric ODE models. When conducting an experiment and inferring the parameter value from the time-series data, we want to know if the value is globally, locally, or non-identifiable. Global identifiability of the parameter indicates that there exists only one possible solution to the inference problem, local identifiability suggests that there could be several (but finitely many) possibilities, while non-identifiability implies that there are infinitely many possibilities for the value. Having this information is useful since, one would, for example, only perform inferences for the parameters which are identifiable. Given the current significance and widespread research conducted in this area, we decided to create a database of linear compartment models and their identifiability results. This facilitates the process of checking theorems and conjectures and drawing conclusions on identifiability. By only storing models up to symmetries and isomorphisms, we optimize memory efficiency and reduce query time. We conclude by applying our database to real problems. We tested a conjecture about deleting one leak of the model states in the paper 'Linear compartmental models: Input-output equations and operations that preserve identifiability' by E. Gross et al., and managed to produce a counterexample. We also compute some interesting statistics related to the identifiability of linear compartment model parameters.</p></details> |  |

Along with the temporal and feature correlations, the heterogeneous nature of the feature in the table has been one of the main obstacles in time series tabular data modeling. We tackle this problem by combining the ideas of the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Our model named as \texttt{TimeAutoDiff} has several key advantages including (1) Generality: the ability to handle the broad spectrum of time series tabular data from single to multi-sequence datasets; (2) Good fidelity and utility guarantees: numerical experiments on six publicly available datasets demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in generating time series tabular data, across four metrics measuring fidelity and utility; (3) Fast sampling speed: entire time series data generation as opposed to the sequential data sampling schemes implemented in the existing diffusion-based models, eventually leading to significant improvements in sampling speed, (4) Entity conditional generation: the first implementation of conditional generation of multi-sequence time series tabular data with heterogenous features in the literature, enabling scenario exploration across multiple scientific and engineering domains.

| **[Discovering Mixtures of Structural Causal Models from Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06312v3)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relationships from time series data is significant in fields such as finance, climate science, and neuroscience. However, contemporary techniques rely on the simplifying assumption that data originates from the same causal model, while in practice, data is heterogeneous and can stem from different causal models. In this work, we relax this assumption and perform causal discovery from time series data originating from a mixture of causal models. We propose a general variational inference-based framework called MCD to infer the underlying causal models as well as the mixing probability of each sample. Our approach employs an end-to-end training process that maximizes an evidence-lower bound for the data likelihood. We present two variants: MCD-Linear for linear relationships and independent noise, and MCD-Nonlinear for nonlinear causal relationships and history-dependent noise. We demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in causal discovery tasks through extensive experimentation on synthetic and real-world datasets, particularly when the data emanates from diverse underlying causal graphs. Theoretically, we prove the identifiability of such a model under some mild assumptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive variational Gaussian approximation with the Whittle likelihood for linear non-Gaussian state space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15998v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter inference for linear and non-Gaussian state space models is challenging because the likelihood function contains an intractable integral over the latent state variables. Exact inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo is computationally expensive, particularly for long time series data. Variational Bayes methods are useful when exact inference is infeasible. These methods approximate the posterior density of the parameters by a simple and tractable distribution found through optimisation. In this paper, we propose a novel sequential variational Bayes approach that makes use of the Whittle likelihood for computationally efficient parameter inference in this class of state space models. Our algorithm, which we call Recursive Variational Gaussian Approximation with the Whittle Likelihood (R-VGA-Whittle), updates the variational parameters by processing data in the frequency domain. At each iteration, R-VGA-Whittle requires the gradient and Hessian of the Whittle log-likelihood, which are available in closed form for a wide class of models. Through several examples using a linear Gaussian state space model and a univariate/bivariate non-Gaussian stochastic volatility model, we show that R-VGA-Whittle provides good approximations to posterior distributions of the parameters and is very computationally efficient when compared to asymptotically exact methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best of Many in Both Worlds: Online Resource Allocation with Predictions under Unknown Arrival Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13530v2)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online decision-makers often obtain predictions on future variables, such as arrivals, demands, inventories, and so on. These predictions can be generated from simple forecasting algorithms for univariate time-series, all the way to state-of-the-art machine learning models that leverage multiple time-series and additional feature information. However, the prediction accuracy is unknown to decision-makers a priori, hence blindly following the predictions can be harmful. In this paper, we address this problem by developing algorithms that utilize predictions in a manner that is robust to the unknown prediction accuracy. We consider the Online Resource Allocation Problem, a generic model for online decision-making, in which a limited amount of resources may be used to satisfy a sequence of arriving requests. Prior work has characterized the best achievable performances when the arrivals are either generated stochastically (i.i.d.) or completely adversarially, and shown that algorithms exist which match these bounds under both arrival models, without ``knowing'' the underlying model. To this backdrop, we introduce predictions in the form of shadow prices on each type of resource. Prediction accuracy is naturally defined to be the distance between the predictions and the actual shadow prices. We tightly characterize, via a formal lower bound, the extent to which any algorithm can optimally leverage predictions (that is, to ``follow'' the predictions when accurate, and ``ignore'' them when inaccurate) without knowing the prediction accuracy or the underlying arrival model. Our main contribution is then an algorithm which achieves this lower bound. Finally, we empirically validate our algorithm with a large-scale experiment on real data from the retailer H&M.</p></details> |  |

The solar driver forecasting framework includes an 18-day lookback window and forecasts 6 days into the future. When benchmarked against the Space Environment Technologies (SET) dataset, our model consistently produces forecasts with a lower standard mean error in nearly all cases, with improved prediction accuracy during periods of high solar activity.

However, most existing studies ignore the complementarity and semantic consistency of multimodal physiological signals under the same stimulation task in complex spatio-temporal patterns. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal physiological signals representation learning framework using Siamese architecture via multiscale contrasting for depression recognition (MRLMC). First, fNIRS and EEG are transformed into different but correlated data based on a time-domain data augmentation strategy. Then, we design a spatio-temporal contrasting module to learn the representation of fNIRS and EEG through weight-sharing multiscale spatio-temporal convolution. Furthermore, to enhance the learning of semantic representation associated with stimulation tasks, a semantic consistency contrast module is proposed, aiming to maximize the semantic similarity of fNIRS and EEG. Extensive experiments on publicly available and self-collected multimodal physiological signals datasets indicate that MRLMC outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our proposed framework is capable of transferring to multimodal time series downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, are language models actually useful for time series? After a series of ablation studies on three recent and popular LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we find that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer does not degrade the forecasting results -- in most cases the results even improved. We also find that despite their significant computational cost, pretrained LLMs do no better than models trained from scratch, do not represent the sequential dependencies in time series, and do not assist in few-shot settings. Additionally, we explore time series encoders and reveal that patching and attention structures perform similarly to state-of-the-art LLM-based forecasters.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures and 20 tables</p></details> |
| **[The roughness exponent and its model-free estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10301v6)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by pathwise stochastic calculus, we say that a continuous real-valued function $x$ admits the roughness exponent $R$ if the $p^{\text{th}}$ variation of $x$ converges to zero if $p>1/R$ and to infinity if $p<1/R$. For the sample paths of many stochastic processes, such as fractional Brownian motion, the roughness exponent exists and equals the standard Hurst parameter. In our main result, we provide a mild condition on the Faber--Schauder coefficients of $x$ under which the roughness exponent exists and is given as the limit of the classical Gladyshev estimates $\widehat R_n(x)$. This result can be viewed as a strong consistency result for the Gladyshev estimators in an entirely model-free setting, because it works strictly trajectory-wise and requires no probabilistic assumptions. Nonetheless, our proof is probabilistic and relies on a martingale that is hidden in the Faber--Schauder expansion of $x$. Since the Gladyshev estimators are not scale-invariant, we construct several scale-invariant estimators that are derived from the sequence $(\widehat R_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$. We also discuss how a dynamic change in the roughness parameter of a time series can be detected. Finally, we extend our results to the case in which the $p^{\text{th}}$ variation of $x$ is defined over a sequence of unequally spaced partitions. Our results are illustrated by means of high-frequency financial time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Koopman prior for data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05317v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of large scale datasets, computational power and tools like automatic differentiation and expressive neural network architectures, sequential data are now often treated in a data-driven way, with a dynamical model trained from the observation data. While neural networks are often seen as uninterpretable black-box architectures, they can still benefit from physical priors on the data and from mathematical knowledge. In this paper, we use a neural network architecture which leverages the long-known Koopman operator theory to embed dynamical systems in latent spaces where their dynamics can be described linearly, enabling a number of appealing features. We introduce methods that enable to train such a model for long-term continuous reconstruction, even in difficult contexts where the data comes in irregularly-sampled time series. The potential for self-supervised learning is also demonstrated, as we show the promising use of trained dynamical models as priors for variational data assimilation techniques, with applications to e.g. time series interpolation and forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We consider the well-known benchmark NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) data as the main data for this paper, which consists of sensor outputs in a variety of different operating modes. C-MAPSS is a well-studied dataset with much existing work in the literature that address RUL prediction with classical and deep learning methods. In the absence of published empirical physical laws governing the C-MAPSS data, our approach first uses stochastic methods to estimate the governing physics models from the noisy time series data. In our approach, we model the various sensor readings as being governed by stochastic differential equations, and we estimate the corresponding transition density mean and variance functions of the underlying processes. We then augment LSTM (long-short term memory) models with the learned mean and variance functions during training and inferencing. Our PIML based approach is different from previous methods, and we use the data to first learn the physics. Our results indicate that PIML discovery and solutions methods are well suited for this problem and outperform previous data-only deep learning methods for this data set and task. Moreover, the framework developed herein is flexible, and can be adapted to other situations (other sensor modalities or combined multi-physics environments), including cases where the underlying physics is only partially observed or known.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Model for Change Point Detection in Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04719v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a generative model to detect change points in time series of graphs. The proposed framework consists of learnable prior distributions for low-dimensional graph representations and of a decoder that can generate graphs from the latent representations. The informative prior distributions in the latent spaces are learned from the observed data as empirical Bayes, and the expressive power of generative model is exploited to assist multiple change point detection. Specifically, the model parameters are learned via maximum approximate likelihood, with a Group Fused Lasso regularization on the prior parameters. The optimization problem is then solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and Langevin Dynamics are recruited for posterior inference. Experiments in both simulated and real data demonstrate the ability of the generative model in supporting change point detection with good performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Attention in Hierarchical Transformers for Tabular Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15327v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data is ubiquitous in many real-life systems. In particular, time-dependent tabular data, where rows are chronologically related, is typically used for recording historical events, e.g., financial transactions, healthcare records, or stock history. Recently, hierarchical variants of the attention mechanism of transformer architectures have been used to model tabular time-series data. At first, rows (or columns) are encoded separately by computing attention between their fields. Subsequently, encoded rows (or columns) are attended to one another to model the entire tabular time-series. While efficient, this approach constrains the attention granularity and limits its ability to learn patterns at the field-level across separate rows, or columns. We take a first step to address this gap by proposing Fieldy, a fine-grained hierarchical model that contextualizes fields at both the row and column levels. We compare our proposal against state of the art models on regression and classification tasks using public tabular time-series datasets. Our results show that combining row-wise and column-wise attention improves performance without increasing model size.

A promising approach for real-time analysis of the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal and the detection of heart conditions, such as arrhythmia, is represented by the transformer machine learning model. Transformers are powerful models for the classification of time series, although efficient implementation in the wearable domain raises significant design challenges, to combine adequate accuracy and a suitable complexity. In this work, we present a tiny transformer model for the analysis of the ECG signal, requiring only 6k parameters and reaching 98.97% accuracy in the recognition of the 5 most common arrhythmia classes from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, assessed considering 8-bit integer inference as required for efficient execution on low-power microcontroller-based devices. We explored an augmentation-based training approach for improving the robustness against electrode motion artifacts noise, resulting in a worst-case post-deployment performance assessment of 98.36% accuracy. Suitability for wearable monitoring solutions is finally demonstrated through efficient deployment on the parallel ultra-low-power GAP9 processor, where inference execution requires 4.28ms and 0.09mJ.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems</p></details> |

It consists of regularly sampled continuous time series and irregularly sampled categorical event sequences. The integration of both modalities through multimodal fusion is a promising approach for processing MTTS. However, the question of how to effectively fuse both modalities remains open. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of several deep multimodal fusion approaches for MTTS forecasting. Our comparison includes three fusion types (early, intermediate, and late) and five fusion methods (concatenation, weighted mean, weighted mean with correlation, gating, and feature sharing). We evaluate these fusion approaches on three distinct datasets, one of which was generated using a novel framework. This framework allows for the control of key data properties, such as the strength and direction of intermodal interactions, modality imbalance, and the degree of randomness in each modality, providing a more controlled environment for testing fusion approaches. Our findings show that the performance of different fusion approaches can be substantially influenced by the direction and strength of intermodal interactions. The study reveals that early and intermediate fusion approaches excel at capturing fine-grained and coarse-grained cross-modal features, respectively. These findings underscore the crucial role of intermodal interactions in determining the most effective fusion strategy for MTTS forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Progression Events in Multiple Myeloma from Routine Blood Work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18051v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to accurately predict disease progression is paramount for optimizing multiple myeloma patient care. This study introduces a hybrid neural network architecture, combining Long Short-Term Memory networks with a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine, to predict future blood work of affected patients from a series of historical laboratory results. We demonstrate that our model can replicate the statistical moments of the time series ($0.95~\pm~0.01~\geq~R^2~\geq~0.83~\pm~0.03$) and forecast future blood work features with high correlation to actual patient data ($0.92\pm0.02~\geq~r~\geq~0.52~\pm~0.09$). Subsequently, a second Long Short-Term Memory network is employed to detect and annotate disease progression events within the forecasted blood work time series. We show that these annotations enable the prediction of progression events with significant reliability (AUROC$~=~0.88~\pm~0.01$), up to 12 months in advance (AUROC($t+12~$mos)$~=0.65~\pm~0.01$). Our system is designed in a modular fashion, featuring separate entities for forecasting and progression event annotation. This structure not only enhances interpretability but also facilitates the integration of additional modules to perform subsequent operations on the generated outputs. Our approach utilizes a minimal set of routine blood work measurements, which avoids the need for expensive or resource-intensive tests and ensures accessibility of the system in clinical routine. This capability allows for individualized risk assessment and making informed treatment decisions tailored to a patient's unique disease kinetics. The represented approach contributes to the development of a scalable and cost-effective virtual human twin system for optimized healthcare resource utilization and improved patient outcomes in multiple myeloma care.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures, 4, tables</p></details> |

While research has primarily focused on achieving increasingly efficient valid intervals, we argue that, when evaluating a set of intervals, traditional measures alone are insufficient. There are additional crucial characteristics: the intervals must vary in length, with this variation directly linked to the difficulty of the prediction, and the coverage of the interval must remain independent of the difficulty of the prediction for practical utility. We propose the Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) model and the Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI) method, providing theoretical coverage guarantees, to overcome those issues, respectively. The methodologies are evaluated in the context of Electricity Price Forecasting and Wind Power Forecasting, representing complex scenarios in time series forecasting. The results demonstrate that HQR and WACI not only improve or achieve typical measures of validity and efficiency but also successfully fulfil the commonly ignored mentioned characteristics.</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamics of human-AI interaction in the collaborative writing process are not well understood, and thus it remains largely unknown how human learning can be effectively supported with such cutting-edge GAI technologies. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating how humans employ GAI in collaborative writing and examining the interplay between the patterns of GAI usage and human writing behaviors. Considering the potential varying degrees to which people rely on GAI usage, we proposed to use Dynamic Time Warping time-series clustering for the identification and analysis of common temporal patterns in AI usage during the human-AI collaborative writing processes. Additionally, we incorporated Epistemic Network Analysis to reveal the correlation between GAI usage and human writing behaviors that reflect cognitive processes (i.e., knowledge telling, knowledge transformation, and cognitive presence), aiming to offer insights for developing better approaches and tools to support human to learn effectively via such human-AI collaborative writing activities. Our findings reveal four major distinct temporal patterns in AI utilization and highlight significant correlations between these patterns and human writing behaviors. These findings have significant implications for effectively supporting human learning with GAI in educational writing tasks.</p></details> |  |

In the domain adaptation setting where unlabeled target data is available, self-supervised pretraining (e.g., masked autoencoding or contrastive learning) is a promising method to mitigate this performance drop. Pretraining improves OOD error when the generic data augmentations used (e.g., masking or cropping) connect the source and target domains, which may be far apart in the input space. In this paper, we show on real-world tasks that standard fine-tuning after pretraining does not consistently improve OOD error over simply training from scratch on labeled source data. To better leverage pretraining for distribution shifts, we propose Connect Later: after pretraining with generic augmentations, fine-tune with targeted augmentations designed with knowledge of the distribution shift. Pretraining learns good representations within the source and target domains, while targeted augmentations connect the domains better during fine-tuning. Connect Later improves average OOD error over standard fine-tuning and supervised learning with targeted augmentations on 4 real-world datasets: Connect Later achieves the state-of-the-art on astronomical time-series classification (AstroClassification) by 2.5%, wildlife species identification (iWildCam-WILDS) with ResNet-50 by 0.9%, and tumor identification (Camelyon17-WILDS) with DenseNet121 by 1.1%; as well as best performance on a new dataset for astronomical time-series redshift prediction (Redshifts) by 0.03 RMSE (11% relative).

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes QxEAI, a methodology that produces a probabilistic forecast that utilizes a quantum-like evolutionary algorithm based on training a quantum-like logic decision tree and a classical value tree on a small number of related time series. We demonstrate how the application of our quantum-like evolutionary algorithm to forecasting can overcome the challenges faced by classical and other machine learning approaches. By using three real-world datasets (Dow Jones Index, retail sales, gas consumption), we show how our methodology produces accurate forecasts while requiring little to none manual work.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models. We study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest. Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Temporal Components for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14456v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing sequential data is crucial in many domains, particularly due to the abundance of data collected from the Internet of Things paradigm. Time series classification, the task of categorizing sequential data, has gained prominence, with machine learning approaches demonstrating remarkable performance on public benchmark datasets. However, progress has primarily been in designing architectures for learning representations from raw data at fixed (or ideal) time scales, which can fail to generalize to longer sequences. This work introduces a \textit{compositional representation learning} approach trained on statistically coherent components extracted from sequential data. Based on a multi-scale change space, an unsupervised approach is proposed to segment the sequential data into chunks with similar statistical properties. A sequence-based encoder model is trained in a multi-task setting to learn compositional representations from these temporal components for time series classification. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on publicly available time series classification benchmarks. Evaluating the coherence of segmented components shows its competitive performance on the unsupervised segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of weather predictions by optimizing models based on public meteorological data. However, existing public datasets for GSWF optimization and benchmarking still suffer from significant limitations, such as small sizes, limited temporal coverage, and a lack of comprehensive variables. These shortcomings prevent them from effectively reflecting the benchmarks of current forecasting methods and fail to support the real needs of operational weather forecasting. To address these challenges, we present the WEATHER-5K dataset. This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of data from 5,672 weather stations worldwide, spanning a 10-year period with one-hour intervals. It includes multiple crucial weather elements, providing a more reliable and interpretable resource for forecasting. Furthermore, our WEATHER-5K dataset can serve as a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating existing well-known forecasting models, extending beyond GSWF methods to support future time-series research challenges and opportunities. The dataset and benchmark implementation are publicly available at: https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K.</p></details> | 26 pages,13 figures |

| **[An agent-based model of behaviour change calibrated to reversal learning data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14062v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behaviour change lies at the heart of many observable collective phenomena such as the transmission and control of infectious diseases, adoption of public health policies, and migration of animals to new habitats. Representing the process of individual behaviour change in computer simulations of these phenomena remains an open challenge. Often, computational models use phenomenological implementations with limited support from behavioural data. Without a strong connection to observable quantities, such models have limited utility for simulating observed and counterfactual scenarios of emergent phenomena because they cannot be validated or calibrated. Here, we present a simple stochastic individual-based model of reversal learning that captures fundamental properties of individual behaviour change, namely, the capacity to learn based on accumulated reward signals, and the transient persistence of learned behaviour after rewards are removed or altered. The model has only two parameters, and we use approximate Bayesian computation to demonstrate that they are fully identifiable from empirical reversal learning time series data. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be extended to account for the increased complexity of behavioural dynamics over longer time scales involving fluctuating stimuli. This work is a step towards the development and evaluation of fully identifiable individual-level behaviour change models that can function as validated submodels for complex simulations of collective behaviour change.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configurations. In this work, we comprehensively analyze these design choices and aim to identify the best practices for training LTSM. Moreover, we propose \emph{time series prompt}, a novel statistical prompting strategy tailored to time series data. Furthermore, based on the observations in our analysis, we introduce \texttt{LTSM-bundle}, which bundles the best design choices we have identified. Empirical results demonstrate that \texttt{LTSM-bundle} achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LSTMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:nlin/0307015 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Robust Time Series Forecasting with Non-Heavy-Tailed Gaussian Loss-Weighted Sampler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13871v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting multivariate time series is a computationally intensive task challenged by extreme or redundant samples. Recent resampling methods aim to increase training efficiency by reweighting samples based on their running losses. However, these methods do not solve the problems caused by heavy-tailed distribution losses, such as overfitting to outliers. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel approach: a Gaussian loss-weighted sampler that multiplies their running losses with a Gaussian distribution weight. It reduces the probability of selecting samples with very low or very high losses while favoring those close to average losses. As it creates a weighted loss distribution that is not heavy-tailed theoretically, there are several advantages to highlight compared to existing methods: 1) it relieves the inefficiency in learning redundant easy samples and overfitting to outliers, 2) It improves training efficiency by preferentially learning samples close to the average loss. Application on real-world time series forecasting datasets demonstrate improvements in prediction quality for 1%-4% using mean square error measurements in channel-independent settings. The code will be available online after 1 the review.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Central to this is the phenomenon of coronal holes, which can significantly influence the functioning of satellites and aircraft. These coronal holes, present on the sun, are distinguished by their open magnetic field lines and comparatively cooler temperatures, leading to the emission of solar winds at heightened rates. To anticipate the effects of these coronal holes on Earth, our study harnesses computer vision to pinpoint the coronal hole regions and estimate their dimensions using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Further, we deploy deep learning methodologies, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach, to analyze the trends in the data related to the area of the coronal holes and predict their dimensions across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By evaluating the time series data concerning the area of the coronal holes, our research seeks to uncover patterns in the behavior of coronal holes and comprehend their potential influence on space weather occurrences. This investigation marks a pivotal stride towards bolstering our capacity to anticipate and brace for space weather events that could have ramifications for Earth and its technological apparatuses.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This has some problems in data such as noise.

Like neural network layers, these attention mechanisms are often developed by heuristics and experience. To provide a principled framework for constructing attention layers in transformers, we show that the self-attention corresponds to the support vector expansion derived from a support vector regression problem, whose primal formulation has the form of a neural network layer. Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2) the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2023, 26 pages, 4 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

In masquerade attacks, adversaries silence a targeted ID and then send malicious frames with forged content at the expected timing of benign frames. As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by introducing a benchmark study of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing benchmarks in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although benchmarked IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes at the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the benchmarked methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

A popular analysis procedure used by the community assumes an optimal window length to design recognition pipelines. However, in the scenario of smart homes, where activities are of varying duration and frequency, the assumption of a constant sized window does not hold. Additionally, previous works have shown these activities to be made up of building blocks. We focus on identifying these underlying building blocks--structural constructs, with the use of large language models. Identifying these constructs can be beneficial especially in recognizing short-duration and infrequent activities. We also propose the development of an activity recognition procedure that uses these building blocks to model activities, thus helping the downstream task of activity monitoring in smart homes.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Causal evaluation of sequentially observed time series data from control and treated units focuses on the impacts of interventions using contemporaneous outcomes in control units. Methodological developments here concern multivariate dynamic models for time-varying effects across multiple treated units with explicit foci on sequential learning and aggregation of intervention effects. Analysis explores dimension reduction across multiple synthetic counterfactual predictors. Computational advances leverage fully conjugate models for efficient sequential learning and inference, including cross-unit correlations and their time variation. This allows full uncertainty quantification on model hyper-parameters via Bayesian model averaging. A detailed case study evaluates interventions in a supermarket promotions experiment, with coupled predictive analyses in selected regions of a large-scale commercial system. Comparisons with existing methods highlight the issues of appropriate uncertainty quantification in casual inference in aggregation across treated units, among other practical concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Schrödinger Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04795v3)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Neuro implants can be used for effective treatment by suppressing an upcoming seizure upon detection. Due to the restricted size and limited battery lifetime of those medical devices, the employed approach also needs to be limited in size and have low energy requirements. We present an energy-efficient seizure detection approach involving a TC-ResNet and time-series analysis which is suitable for low-power edge devices. The presented approach allows for accurate seizure detection without preceding feature extraction while considering the stringent hardware requirements of neural implants. The approach is validated using the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database with a 32-bit floating point model and a hardware suitable 4-bit fixed point model. The presented method achieves an accuracy of 95.28%, a sensitivity of 92.34% and an AUC score of 0.9384 on this dataset with 4-bit fixed point representation. Furthermore, the power consumption of the model is measured with the low-power AI accelerator UltraTrail, which only requires 495 nW on average. Due to this low-power consumption this classification approach is suitable for real-time seizure detection on low-power wearable devices such as neural implants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2024 (Preprint)</p></details> |

This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

| **[Multi-scale Restoration of Missing Data in Optical Time-series Images with Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13358v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to factors such as thick cloud cover and sensor limitations, remote sensing images often suffer from significant missing data, resulting in incomplete time-series information. Existing methods for imputing missing values in remote sensing images do not fully exploit spatio-temporal auxiliary information, leading to limited accuracy in restoration. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach called MS2TAN (Multi-scale Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network), for reconstructing time-series remote sensing images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient spatio-temporal feature extractor based on Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention (MSTA), to obtain high-quality representations of the spatio-temporal neighborhood features in the missing regions. Secondly, a Multi-scale Restoration Network consisting of the MSTA-based Feature Extractors, is employed to progressively refine the missing values by exploring spatio-temporal neighborhood features at different scales. Thirdly, we propose a ``Pixel-Structure-Perception'' Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method to enhance the visual effects of the reconstruction results from multiple perspectives and preserve more texture structures. Furthermore, the proposed method reconstructs missing values in all input temporal phases in parallel (i.e., Multi-In Multi-Out), achieving higher processing efficiency. Finally, experimental evaluations on two typical missing data restoration tasks across multiple research areas demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an improvement of 0.40dB/1.17dB in mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (mPSNR) and 3.77/9.41 thousandths in mean structural similarity (mSSIM), while exhibiting stronger texture and structural consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Right on Time: Revising Time Series Models by Constraining their Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12921v3)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of deep time series models is often compromised by their tendency to rely on confounding factors, which may lead to incorrect outputs. Our newly recorded, naturally confounded dataset named P2S from a real mechanical production line emphasizes this. To avoid "Clever-Hans" moments in time series, i.e., to mitigate confounders, we introduce the method Right on Time (RioT). RioT enables, for the first time, interactions with model explanations across both the time and frequency domain. Feedback on explanations in both domains is then used to constrain the model, steering it away from the annotated confounding factors. The dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing confounders in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate that RioT can effectively guide models away from the wrong reasons in P2S as well as popular time series classification and forecasting datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFB: Towards Comprehensive and Fair Benchmarking of Time Series Forecasting Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20150v3)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Direc...</summary><p>Directly accepted by PVLDB 2024</p></details> |

Signatures have recently been widely adopted in machine learning problems for time series analysis. In this work we establish connections between value functions typically used in optimal control and intriguing properties of path signatures. These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories. We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control. In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable for problems with unknown disturbances. The proposed algorithms are tested in simulation, with differentiable physics models including typical control and robotics tasks such as point-mass, curve following for an ant model, and a robotic manipulator.</p></details> | 48 pages, 21 figures |

To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average. Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/ClaudiaShu/DeformTime</p></details> |

To do so, we use time-series of case-counts of symptomatic patients as observed in the areal units that comprise the region. We also extend an epidemiological model, initially developed to represent the temporal dynamics in a single areal unit, to encompass multiple areal units. This is done using a (parameterized) Gaussian random field, whose structure is modeled using the dynamics in the case-counts, and which serves as a spatial prior, in the estimation process. The estimation is performed using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo method, using COVID-19 case-count data collected from three adjacent counties in New Mexico, USA. We find that we can estimate both the temporal and spatial variation of the infection with sufficient accuracy to be useful in forecasting. Further, the ability to "borrow" information from neighboring areal units allows us to regularize the estimation in areal units with high variance ("poor quality") data. The ability to forecast allows us to check whether the estimated infection-rate can be used to detect a change in the epidemiological dynamics e.g., the arrival of a new wave of infection, such as the fall wave of 2020 which arrived in New Mexico in mid-September 2020. We fashion a simple anomaly detector, conditioned on the estimated infection-rate and find that it performs better than a conventional surveillance algorithm that uses case-counts (and not the infection-rate) to detect the arrival of the same wave.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Bayesian Consistency for Long Memory Processes: A Semiparametric Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12780v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we will investigate a Bayesian approach to estimating the parameters of long memory models. Long memory, characterized by the phenomenon of hyperbolic autocorrelation decay in time series, has garnered significant attention. This is because, in many situations, the assumption of short memory, such as the Markovianity assumption, can be deemed too restrictive. Applications for long memory models can be readily found in fields such as astronomy, finance, and environmental sciences. However, current parametric and semiparametric approaches to modeling long memory present challenges, particularly in the estimation process. In this study, we will introduce various methods applied to this problem from a Bayesian perspective, along with a novel semiparametric approach for deriving the posterior distribution of the long memory parameter. Additionally, we will establish the asymptotic properties of the model. An advantage of this approach is that it allows to implement state-of-the-art efficient algorithms for nonparametric Bayesian models.</p></details> |  |

These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/vivekmyers/contrastive_planning</p></details> |

This paper introduces a method that leverages anticipatory road data, such as speed limits, road slopes, and traffic lights, beyond the local perception range to optimize energy-efficient braking trajectories. For that, coasting, which reduces energy consumption, and active braking are combined to transition from the current vehicle velocity to a lower target velocity at a given distance ahead. Finding the switching instants between the coasting phases and the continuous control for the braking phase is addressed as an optimal trade-off between maximizing coasting periods and minimizing braking effort. The resulting switched optimal control problem is solved by deriving necessary optimality conditions. To facilitate the incorporation of additional feasibility constraints for multi-phase trajectories, a sub-optimal alternative solution based on parametric optimization is proposed. Both methods are compared in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear at the European Control Conference 2024 (ECC'24)</p></details> |

However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. (2) Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the Decorator, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. (3) Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the Detailer, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/imlixinyang/director3d</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. GPS trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the GPS trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching APIs produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the GPS trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical GPS trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |

While existing works mainly focus on training-based methods (e.g., conditional adapter), we argue that diffusion model itself allows decent control over the generated content without requiring any training. In this study, we introduce a tuning-free framework to achieve trajectory-controllable video generation, by imposing guidance on both noise construction and attention computation. Specifically, 1) we first show several instructive phenomenons and analyze how initial noises influence the motion trajectory of generated content. 2) Subsequently, we propose FreeTraj, a tuning-free approach that enables trajectory control by modifying noise sampling and attention mechanisms. 3) Furthermore, we extend FreeTraj to facilitate longer and larger video generation with controllable trajectories. Equipped with these designs, users have the flexibility to provide trajectories manually or opt for trajectories automatically generated by the LLM trajectory planner. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the trajectory controllability of video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://haonanqiu.com/projects/FreeTraj.html, Code Repo: https://github.com/arthur-qiu/FreeTraj</p></details> |

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |
| **[Bad Habits: Policy Confounding and Out-of-Trajectory Generalization in RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02419v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning agents tend to develop habits that are effective only under specific policies. Following an initial exploration phase where agents try out different actions, they eventually converge onto a particular policy. As this occurs, the distribution over state-action trajectories becomes narrower, leading agents to repeatedly experience the same transitions. This repetitive exposure fosters spurious correlations between certain observations and rewards. Agents may then pick up on these correlations and develop simplistic habits tailored to the specific set of trajectories dictated by their policy. The problem is that these habits may yield incorrect outcomes when agents are forced to deviate from their typical trajectories, prompted by changes in the environment. This paper presents a mathematical characterization of this phenomenon, termed policy confounding, and illustrates, through a series of examples, the circumstances under which it occurs.</p></details> |  |

Towards this end, we introduce some natural notions of the complexity of optimization trajectories, both qualitative and quantitative, which hallmark the directional nature of optimization in neural networks: when is there redundancy, and when exploration. We use them to reveal the inherent nuance and interplay involved between various optimization choices, such as momentum and weight decay. Further, the trajectory perspective helps us see the effect of scale on regularizing the directional nature of trajectories, and as a by-product, we also observe an intriguing heterogeneity of Q,K,V dynamics in the middle attention layers in LLMs and which is homogenized by scale. Importantly, we put the significant directional redundancy observed to the test by demonstrating that training only scalar batchnorm parameters some while into training matches the performance of training the entire network, which thus exhibits the potential of hybrid optimization schemes that are geared towards efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint, 57 pages |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis reduces sample size requirements and expedites time-to-efficacy signals in advanced cancer clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02529v4)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis is limited to single unidirectional endpoints, most advanced cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered for either progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

With the change in modern UAV application scenarios, it is required that UAVs have fast maneuverable three-dimensional flight capabilities. Due to the highly nonlinear aerodynamics produced by the fuselage and wings of the tail-sitter, how to quickly generate a smooth and executable trajectory is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. We constrain the speed of the tail-sitter, eliminate the differential dynamics constraints in the trajectory generation process of the tail-sitter through differential flatness, and allocate the time variable of the trajectory through the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method named MINCO. By discretizing the trajectory in time, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint, thereby achieving the time-optimal trajectory for the tail-sitter to fly through any given waypoints.</p></details> |  |

Existing planning methods suffer from issues such as long computation times, limited capacity to address intricate obstacle models, and lack of consideration for external disturbances and measurement inaccuracies in these high-dimensional systems. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning approach that combines Dynamic Control Barrier Function (DCBF) with a disturbance observer to create a Robust Dynamic Control Barrier Function (RDCBF) planner. This approach successfully plans trajectories in environments with complex dynamic obstacles while accounting for external disturbances and measurement uncertainties, ensuring system safety and enabling precise obstacle avoidance. Experimental results on a mobile manipulator demonstrate outstanding performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of Trajectories for Machine Learning Training in Robot Accuracy Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15620v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been developed for increasing the accuracy of robot mechanisms. Complex mechanical issues such as non-linear friction, backlash, flexibility of structure transmission elements can cause these errors and they are hard to model. ML requires training data and the above mechanical phenomena are highly dependent on position of the robot in the workspace and also on its velocity, especially near zero velocity in both directions where non-linearities such as Streibek and Coulomb friction are most pronounced. It is well known that success of ML methods depends on amount of training data and it is expensive/time consuming to collect data from physical robot motion. We therefore address the problem of searching for trajectories in the 6D space of positions and velocities which collect the most information in the least amount of time. This reduces to a special case of the traveling-salesman problem in that the robot must be programmed to visit sampled points in the position-velocity phase space most efficiently. Two goals of this work are 1) Computationally study the difficulty of the TSP in this application by applying it to X, Y, Z motion in 3D space (6D phase space) and 2) assess the effectiveness of an extremely simple Nearest Neighbor search algorithm compared to random sampling of the search space. Results confirm that Nearest Neighbor heuristic searching produces significantly better trajectories than random sampling in this application.</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of extracting 3D condylar trajectories from 2D real-time MRI and to assess their precision.Twenty healthy subjects underwent real-time MRI while opening and closing their jaws. One axial and two sagittal slices were segmented using a U-Net-based algorithm. The centers of mass of the resulting masks were projected onto the coordinate system based on anatomical markers and temporally adjusted using a common projection. The quality of the computed trajectories was evaluated using metrics designed to estimate movement reproducibility, head motion, and slice placement symmetry.The segmentation of the axial slices demonstrated good-to-excellent quality; however, the segmentation of the sagittal slices required some fine-tuning. The movement reproducibility was acceptable for most cases; nevertheless, head motion displaced the trajectories by 1 mm on average. The difference in the superior-inferior coordinate of the condyles in the closed jaw position was 1.7 mm on average.Despite limitations in precision, real-time MRI enables the extraction of condylar trajectories with sufficient accuracy for evaluating clinically relevant parameters such as condyle displacement, trajectories aspect, and symmetry.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTOP addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTOP is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTOP for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTOP outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Singular knee identification to support emergence recognition in physical swarm and cellular automata trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14652v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After decades of attention, emergence continues to lack a centralized mathematical definition that leads to a rigorous emergence test applicable to physical flocks and swarms, particularly those containing both deterministic elements (eg, interactions) and stochastic perturbations like measurement noise. This study develops a heuristic test based on singular value curve analysis of data matrices containing deterministic and Gaussian noise signals. The minimum detection criteria are identified, and statistical and matrix space analysis developed to determine upper and lower bounds. This study applies the analysis to representative examples by using recorded trajectories of mixed deterministic and stochastic trajectories for multi-agent, cellular automata, and biological video. Examples include Cucker Smale and Vicsek flocking, Gaussian noise and its integration, recorded observations of bird flocking, and 1D cellular automata. Ensemble simulations including measurement noise are performed to compute statistical variation and discussed relative to random matrix theory noise bounds. The results indicate singular knee analysis of recorded trajectories can detect gradated levels on a continuum of structure and noise. Across the eight singular value decay metrics considered, the angle subtended at the singular value knee emerges with the most potential for supporting cross-embodiment emergence detection, the size of noise bounds is used as an indication of required sample size, and the presence of a large fraction of singular values inside noise bounds as an indication of noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures; includes 2 supplementary pages</p></details> |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this, we propose FutureNet, which explicitly integrates initially predicted trajectories into the future scenario and further encodes these future contexts to enhance subsequent forecasting. Additionally, most previous motion forecasting works have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent. However, safe and smooth autonomous driving requires accurately predicting the diverse future behaviors of numerous surrounding agents jointly in complex dynamic environments. Given that all agents occupy certain potential travel spaces and possess lane driving priority, we propose Lane Occupancy Field (LOF), a new representation with lane semantics for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. LOF can simultaneously capture the joint probability distribution of all road participants' future spatial-temporal positions. Due to the high compatibility between lane occupancy field prediction and trajectory prediction, we propose a novel network with future context encoding for the joint prediction of these two tasks. Our approach ranks 1st on two large-scale motion forecasting benchmarks: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals. This paper introduces the task of goal identification from observed UI trajectories, aiming to infer the user's intended task based on their GUI interactions. We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment. By Leveraging the inverse relation with the UI automation task, we utilized the Android-In-The-Wild and Mind2Web datasets for our experiments. Using our metric and these datasets, we conducted several experiments comparing the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our results show that Gemini performs better than GPT but still underperforms compared to humans, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

Our model considers the intentions of other vehicles in the decision-making process and provides the AV with a human-like trajectory, based on the clothoid interpolation technique.% This study investigates a solver based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that quickly converges to an optimal decision.Among highly interactive traffic scenarios, the intersection crossing is particularly challenging. Hence, we choose to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method in real traffic conditions, using an experimental autonomous vehicle at an unsignalized intersection. Testing results reveal that our approach is suitable for 1) Making decisions and generating trajectories simultaneously. 2) Describing the vehicle's trajectory as a piecewise clothoid and enforcing geometric constraints. 3) Reducing search space dimensionality for the trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> |  |

This task is even more difficult in a dynamic environment, e.g., objects are moving. This paper presents a \emph{modular} zero-shot framework for language-driven manipulation of (dynamic) objects through a closed-loop control system with real-time trajectory replanning and an online 6D object pose localization. We segment an object within $\SI{0.5}{\second}$ by leveraging a vision language model via language commands. Then, guided by natural language commands, a closed-loop system, including a unified pose estimation and tracking and online trajectory planning, is utilized to continuously track this object and compute the optimal trajectory in real-time. Our proposed zero-shot framework provides a smooth trajectory that avoids jerky movements and ensures the robot can grasp a non-stationary object. Experiment results exhibit the real-time capability of the proposed zero-shot modular framework for the trajectory optimization module to accurately and efficiently grasp moving objects, i.e., up to \SI{30}{\hertz} update rates for the online 6D pose localization module and \SI{10}{\hertz} update rates for the receding-horizon trajectory optimization. These advantages highlight the modular framework's potential applications in robotics and human-robot interaction; see the video in https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/6e64/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signatures Meet Dynamic Programming: Generalizing Bellman Equations for Trajectory Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05547v2)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path signatures have been proposed as a powerful representation of paths that efficiently captures the path's analytic and geometric characteristics, having useful algebraic properties including fast concatenation of paths through tensor products. Signatures have recently been widely adopted in machine learning problems for time series analysis. In this work we establish connections between value functions typically used in optimal control and intriguing properties of path signatures. These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories. We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control. In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable for problems with unknown disturbances. The proposed algorithms are tested in simulation, with differentiable physics models including typical control and robotics tasks such as point-mass, curve following for an ant model, and a robotic manipulator.</p></details> | 48 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Temporal Prediction of Continuous Disease Trajectories and Treatment Effects Using Neural SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12807v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized medicine based on medical images, including predicting future individualized clinical disease progression and treatment response, would have an enormous impact on healthcare and drug development, particularly for diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS)) with long term, complex, heterogeneous evolutions and no cure. In this work, we present the first stochastic causal temporal framework to model the continuous temporal evolution of disease progression via Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE). The proposed causal inference model takes as input the patient's high dimensional images (MRI) and tabular data, and predicts both factual and counterfactual progression trajectories on different treatments in latent space. The NSDE permits the estimation of high-confidence personalized trajectories and treatment effects. Extensive experiments were performed on a large, multi-centre, proprietary dataset of patient 3D MRI and clinical data acquired during several randomized clinical trials for MS treatments. Our results present the first successful uncertainty-based causal Deep Learning (DL) model to: (a) accurately predict future patient MS disability evolution (e.g. EDSS) and treatment effects leveraging baseline MRI, and (b) permit the discovery of subgroups of patients for which the model has high confidence in their response to treatment even in clinical trials which did not reach their clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models as Zero-Shot Trajectory Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11604v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as high-level planners for robots when given access to a selection of low-level skills. However, it is often assumed that LLMs do not possess sufficient knowledge to be used for the low-level trajectories themselves. In this work, we address this assumption thoroughly, and investigate if an LLM (GPT-4) can directly predict a dense sequence of end-effector poses for manipulation tasks, when given access to only object detection and segmentation vision models. We designed a single, task-agnostic prompt, without any in-context examples, motion primitives, or external trajectory optimisers. Then we studied how well it can perform across 30 real-world language-based tasks, such as "open the bottle cap" and "wipe the plate with the sponge", and we investigated which design choices in this prompt are the most important. Our conclusions raise the assumed limit of LLMs for robotics, and we reveal for the first time that LLMs do indeed possess an understanding of low-level robot control sufficient for a range of common tasks, and that they can additionally detect failures and then re-plan trajectories accordingly.

| **[Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction Under Distributional Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Crossfusor: A Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model for Car-Following Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11941v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. While traditional methods have laid foundational work, modern deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models and generative approaches, have significantly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex and non-linear patterns in vehicle motion and traffic interactions. However, these models often overlook the detailed car-following behaviors and inter-vehicle interactions essential for real-world driving scenarios. This study introduces a Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model (Crossfusor) specifically designed for car-following trajectory prediction. Crossfusor integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a robust diffusion framework, improving both the accuracy and realism of predicted trajectories. The model leverages a novel temporal feature encoding framework combining GRU, location-based attention mechanisms, and Fourier embedding to capture historical vehicle dynamics. It employs noise scaled by these encoded historical features in the forward diffusion process, and uses a cross-attention transformer to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies in the reverse denoising process. Experimental results on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that Crossfusor outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in long-term predictions, showcasing its potential for enhancing the predictive capabilities of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version. 40 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[A First Physical-World Trajectory Prediction Attack via LiDAR-induced Deceptions in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11707v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction forecasts nearby agents' moves based on their historical trajectories. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Existing attacks compromise the prediction model of a victim AV by directly manipulating the historical trajectory of an attacker AV, which has limited real-world applicability. This paper, for the first time, explores an indirect attack approach that induces prediction errors via attacks against the perception module of a victim AV. Although it has been shown that physically realizable attacks against LiDAR-based perception are possible by placing a few objects at strategic locations, it is still an open challenge to find an object location from the vast search space in order to launch effective attacks against prediction under varying victim AV velocities. Through analysis, we observe that a prediction model is prone to an attack focusing on a single point in the scene. Consequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework to realize the single-point attack. The first stage of prediction-side attack efficiently identifies, guided by the distribution of detection results under object-based attacks against perception, the state perturbations for the prediction model that are effective and velocity-insensitive. In the second stage of location matching, we match the feasible object locations with the found state perturbations. Our evaluation using a public autonomous driving dataset shows that our attack causes a collision rate of up to 63% and various hazardous responses of the victim AV. The effectiveness of our attack is also demonstrated on a real testbed car. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first security analysis spanning from LiDAR-based perception to prediction in autonomous driving, leading to a realistic attack on prediction. To counteract the proposed attack, potential defenses are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium 2024</p></details> |

This approach addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting by leveraging the generation of trajectories from previously encountered tasks to augment the current dataset. However, existing deep generative replay methods for continual learning rely on autoregressive models, which suffer from compounding errors in the generated trajectories.

Currently, there exists no principled mathematical theory for their dynamics -- a grand-challenge open problem. Here, we show that the popularity and similarity trajectories of nodes in hyperbolic embeddings of different real networks manifest universal self-similar properties with typical Hurst exponents $H \ll 0.5$. This means that the trajectories are predictable, displaying anti-persistent or 'mean-reverting' behavior, and they can be adequately captured by a fractional Brownian motion process. The observed behavior can be qualitatively reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not in networks that lack such space, suggesting that the observed subdiffusive dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks. These results set the foundations for rigorous mathematical machinery for describing and predicting real network dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Certain trajectories may not be tracked as single, continuous paths due to the robot's kinematic constraints or obstacles elsewhere in the environment. In this situation, it becomes necessary to divide the trajectory into shorter segments. Each such division introduces a reconfiguration, in which the robot deviates from the reference trajectory, repositions itself in configuration space, and then resumes task execution. The occurrence of reconfigurations should be minimized because they increase the time and energy usage. In this paper, we present IKLink, a method for finding joint motions to track reference end-effector trajectories while executing minimal reconfigurations. Our graph-based method generates a diverse set of Inverse Kinematics (IK) solutions for every waypoint on the reference trajectory and utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal motion by linking the IK solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IKLink through a simulation experiment and an illustrative demonstration using a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a contributed paper at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline. This approach enhances efficient GPS data preparation and facilitates a deeper understanding of cycling behavior and the cycling environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.</p></details> |  |

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeTra: A Unified Model for Object Detection and Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04426v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tasks of object detection and trajectory forecasting play a crucial role in understanding the scene for autonomous driving. These tasks are typically executed in a cascading manner, making them prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, there is usually a very thin interface between the two tasks, creating a lossy information bottleneck. To address these challenges, our approach formulates the union of the two tasks as a trajectory refinement problem, where the first pose is the detection (current time), and the subsequent poses are the waypoints of the multiple forecasts (future time). To tackle this unified task, we design a refinement transformer that infers the presence, pose, and multi-modal future behaviors of objects directly from LiDAR point clouds and high-definition maps. We call this model DeTra, short for object Detection and Trajectory forecasting. In our experiments, we observe that \ourmodel{} outperforms the state-of-the-art on Argoverse 2 Sensor and Waymo Open Dataset by a large margin, across a broad range of metrics. Last but not least, we perform extensive ablation studies that show the value of refinement for this task, that every proposed component contributes positively to its performance, and that key design choices were made.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Trajectory Similarity Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12913v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity computation is an essential technique for analyzing moving patterns of spatial data across various applications such as traffic management, wildlife tracking, and location-based services. Modern methods often apply deep learning techniques to approximate heuristic metrics but struggle to learn more robust and generalized representations from the vast amounts of unlabeled trajectory data. Recent approaches focus on self-supervised learning methods such as contrastive learning, which have made significant advancements in trajectory representation learning. However, contrastive learning-based methods heavily depend on manually pre-defined data augmentation schemes, limiting the diversity of generated trajectories and resulting in learning from such variations in 2D Euclidean space, which prevents capturing high-level semantic variations. To address these limitations, we propose T-JEPA, a self-supervised trajectory similarity computation method employing Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to enhance trajectory representation learning. T-JEPA samples and predicts trajectory information in representation space, enabling the model to infer the missing components of trajectories at high-level semantics without relying on domain knowledge or manual effort. Extensive experiments conducted on three urban trajectory datasets and two Foursquare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of T-JEPA in trajectory similarity computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Scenarios Based on Graph Neural Network and Numerical Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08855v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In unstructured environments, obstacles are diverse and lack lane markings, making trajectory planning for intelligent vehicles a challenging task. Traditional trajectory planning methods typically involve multiple stages, including path planning, speed planning, and trajectory optimization. These methods require the manual design of numerous parameters for each stage, resulting in significant workload and computational burden. While end-to-end trajectory planning methods are simple and efficient, they often fail to ensure that the trajectory meets vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints in unstructured scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and numerical optimization. The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) initial trajectory prediction using the GNN, (2) trajectory optimization using numerical optimization. First, the graph neural network processes the environment information and predicts a rough trajectory, replacing traditional path and speed planning. This predicted trajectory serves as the initial solution for the numerical optimization stage, which optimizes the trajectory to ensure compliance with vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints. We conducted simulation experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and compared it with other mainstream planning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed method simplifies the trajectory planning process and significantly improves planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Video Segmenter by Tracking Objects Along Axial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18537v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video segmentation requires consistently segmenting and tracking objects over time. Due to the quadratic dependency on input size, directly applying self-attention to video segmentation with high-resolution input features poses significant challenges, often leading to insufficient GPU memory capacity. Consequently, modern video segmenters either extend an image segmenter without incorporating any temporal attention or resort to window space-time attention in a naive manner. In this work, we present Axial-VS, a general and simple framework that enhances video segmenters by tracking objects along axial trajectories. The framework tackles video segmentation through two sub-tasks: short-term within-clip segmentation and long-term cross-clip tracking. In the first step, Axial-VS augments an off-the-shelf clip-level video segmenter with the proposed axial-trajectory attention, sequentially tracking objects along the height- and width-trajectories within a clip, thereby enhancing temporal consistency by capturing motion trajectories. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense features, and outperforms the window space-time attention in segmentation quality. In the second step, we further employ axial-trajectory attention to the object queries in clip-level segmenters, which are learned to encode object information, thereby aiding object tracking across different clips and achieving consistent segmentation throughout the video. Without bells and whistles, Axial-VS showcases state-of-the-art results on video segmentation benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in addressing the limitations of modern clip-level video segmenters.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs. cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalized Pointing Error Model for FSO Links with Fixed-Wing UAVs for 6G: Analysis and Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05444v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-space optical (FSO) communication is a promising solution to support wireless backhaul links in emerging 6G non-terrestrial networks. At the link level, pointing errors in FSO links can significantly impact capacity, making accurate modeling of these errors essential for both assessing and enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for FSO pointing errors in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that incorporates three-dimensional (3D) jitter, including roll, pitch, and yaw angle jittering. We derive a probability density function for the pointing error angle based on the relative position and posture of the UAV to the ground station. This model is then integrated into a trajectory optimization problem designed to maximize energy efficiency while meeting constraints on speed, acceleration, and elevation angle. Our proposed optimization method significantly improves energy efficiency by adjusting the UAV's flight trajectory to minimize exposure to directions highly affected by jitter. The simulation results emphasize the importance of using UAV-specific 3D jitter models in achieving accurate performance measurements and effective system optimization in FSO communication networks. Utilizing our generalized model, the optimized trajectories achieve up to 11.8 percent higher energy efficiency compared to those derived from conventional Gaussian pointing error models.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under revision; IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning at V2I-enabled Intersections based on Correlated Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05336v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating trajectories that ensure both vehicle safety and improve traffic efficiency remains a challenging task at intersections. Many existing works utilize Nash equilibrium (NE) for the trajectory planning at intersections. However, NE-based planning can hardly guarantee that all vehicles are in the same equilibrium, leading to a risk of collision. In this work, we propose a framework for trajectory planning based on Correlated Equilibrium (CE) when V2I communication is also enabled. The recommendation with CE allows all vehicles to reach a safe and consensual equilibrium and meanwhile keeps the rationality as NE-based methods that no vehicle has the incentive to deviate. The Intersection Manager (IM) first collects the trajectory library and the personal preference probabilities over the library from each vehicle in a low-resolution spatial-temporal grid map. Then, the IM optimizes the recommendation probability distribution for each vehicle's trajectory by minimizing overall collision probability under the CE constraint. Finally, each vehicle samples a trajectory of the low-resolution map to construct a safety corridor and derive a smooth trajectory with a local refinement optimization. We conduct comparative experiments at a crossroad intersection involving two and four vehicles, validating the effectiveness of our method in balancing vehicle safety and traffic efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,12 figures,Submission to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

When the generalization error of the SDE approximation closely aligns with that of SGD in expectation, it provides two opportunities for understanding better the generalization behaviour of SGD through its SDE approximation. Firstly, viewing SGD as full-batch gradient descent with Gaussian gradient noise allows us to obtain trajectory-based generalization bound using the information-theoretic bound from Xu and Raginsky [2017]. Secondly, assuming mild conditions, we estimate the steady-state weight distribution of SDE and use information-theoretic bounds from Xu and Raginsky [2017] and Negrea et al. [2019] to establish terminal-state-based generalization bounds. Our proposed bounds have some advantages, notably the trajectory-based bound outperforms results in Wang and Mao [2022], and the terminal-state-based bound exhibits a fast decay rate comparable to stability-based bounds.</p></details> | Accepted by UAI 2024 |

While LSO excels in single-objective optimization, its multi-objective variants face challenges such as poor initialization, local optima entrapment, and so on. This study proposes Dynamic Multi-Objective Lion Swarm Optimization with Multi-strategy Fusion (MF-DMOLSO) to address these limitations. MF-DMOLSO comprises three key components: initialization, swarm position update, and external archive update. The initialization unit employs chaotic mapping for uniform population distribution. The position update unit enhances behavior patterns and step size formulas for cub lions, incorporating crowding degree sorting, Pareto non-dominated sorting, and Levy flight to improve convergence speed and global search capabilities. Reference points guide convergence in higher-dimensional spaces, maintaining population diversity. An adaptive cold-hot start strategy generates a population responsive to environmental changes. The external archive update unit re-evaluates solutions based on non-domination and diversity to form the new population. Evaluations on benchmark functions showed MF-DMOLSO surpassed multi-objective particle swarm optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and multi-objective lion swarm optimization, exceeding 90% accuracy for two-objective and 97% for three-objective problems. Compared to non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III, MF-DMOLSO showed a 60% improvement. Applied to 6R robot trajectory planning, MF-DMOLSO optimized running time and maximum acceleration to 8.3s and 0.3pi rad/s^2, achieving a set coverage rate of 70.97% compared to 2% by multi-objective particle swarm optimization, thus improving efficiency and reducing mechanical dither.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v3)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |

However, the difficulty of collecting human demonstration data for complex tasks makes learning efficient representations of those trajectories challenging. For many problems, such as for dexterous manipulation, the exact timings of the trajectories should be factored from their spatial path characteristics. In this work, we propose TimewarpVAE, a fully differentiable manifold-learning algorithm that incorporates Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to simultaneously learn both timing variations and latent factors of spatial variation. We show how the TimewarpVAE algorithm learns appropriate time alignments and meaningful representations of spatial variations in handwriting and fork manipulation datasets. Our results have lower spatial reconstruction test error than baseline approaches and the learned low-dimensional representations can be used to efficiently generate semantically meaningful novel trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm to generate novel high-speed trajectories for a robotic arm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artif...</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS): Theory, Algorithms, and Applications Workshop at IJCAI '24</p></details> |

Prior work overcomes this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the learned distribution to facilitate online RL. However, since the offline data are given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult to generalize to new tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff). This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods. The key strength of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of RL methods. Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements in complicated settings.

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN, and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness.

In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

The multi-rotor will operate in the presence of external disturbances and modeling errors. At the same time, the reference trajectory is unknown and generated from a reference system with unknown or partially known dynamics. We assume the only measurements that are available are the position and orientation of the multi-rotor and the position of the reference system. We adopt an extended high-gain observer (EHGO) estimation framework to estimate the unmeasured multi-rotor states, modeling errors, external disturbances, and the reference trajectory. We design a robust output feedback controller for trajectory tracking that comprises a feedback linearizing controller and the EHGO. The proposed control method is rigorously analyzed to establish its stability properties. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results through numerical simulation and experimental validation in which a multi-rotor tracks a moving ground vehicle with an unknown trajectory and dynamics and successfully lands on the vehicle while in motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control.

| **[Improved context-sensitive transformer model for inland vessel trajectory prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02771v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-related and model-based vessel trajectory prediction is highly accurate but requires specific knowledge of the vessel under consideration which is not always practical. Machine learning-based trajectory prediction models do not require expert knowledge, but rely on the implicit knowledge extracted from massive amounts of data. Several deep learning (DL) methods for vessel trajectory prediction have recently been suggested. The DL models developed typically only process information about the (dis)location of vessels defined with respect to a global reference system. In the context of inland navigation, this can be problematic, since without knowledge of the limited navigable space, irrealistic trajectories are likely to be determined. If spatial constraintes are introduced, e.g., by implementing an additional submodule to process map data, however, overall complexity increases. Instead of processing the vessel displacement information on the one hand and the spatial information on the other hand, the paper proposes the merging of both information. Here, fairway-related and navigation-related displacement information are used directly. In this way, the previously proposed context-sensitive Classification Transformer (CSCT) shows an improved spatial awareness. Additionally, the CSCT is adapted to assess the model uncertainty by enabling dropout during inference. This approach is trained on different inland waterways to analyze its generalizability. As the improved CSCT obtains lower prediction errors and enables to estimate the trustworthiness of each prediction, it is more suitable for safety-critical applications in inland navigation than previously developed models.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning-based prediction models, esp. encoder-decoders, are rarely applied to inland navigation specifically. Approaches from the maritime domain cannot directly be transferred to river navigation due to specific driving behavior influencing factors. Different encoder-decoder architectures, including a transformer encoder-decoder, are compared herein for predicting the next positions of inland vessels, given not only spatio-temporal information from AIS, but also river specific features. The results show that the reformulation of the regression task as classification problem and the inclusion of river specific features yield the lowest displacement errors. The standard LSTM encoder-decoder outperforms the transformer encoder-decoder for the data considered, but is computationally more expensive. In this study for the first time a transformer-based encoder-decoder model is applied to the problem of predicting the ship trajectory. Here, a feature vector using the river-specific context of navigation input parameters is established. Future studies can built on the proposed models, investigate the improvement of the computationally more efficient transformer, e.g. through further hyper-parameter optimization, and use additional river-specific information in the context representation to further increase prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and social situation-aware transformer-based trajectory prediction of autonomous systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02767v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous transportation systems such as road vehicles or vessels require the consideration of the static and dynamic environment to dislocate without collision. Anticipating the behavior of an agent in a given situation is required to adequately react to it in time. Developing deep learning-based models has become the dominant approach to motion prediction recently. The social environment is often considered through a CNN-LSTM-based sub-module processing a $\textit{social tensor}$ that includes information of the past trajectory of surrounding agents. For the proposed transformer-based trajectory prediction model, an alternative, computationally more efficient social tensor definition and processing is suggested. It considers the interdependencies between target and surrounding agents at each time step directly instead of relying on information of last hidden LSTM states of individually processed agents. A transformer-based sub-module, the Social Tensor Transformer, is integrated into the overall prediction model. It is responsible for enriching the target agent's dislocation features with social interaction information obtained from the social tensor. For the awareness of spatial limitations, dislocation features are defined in relation to the navigable area. This replaces additional, computationally expensive map processing sub-modules. An ablation study shows, that for longer prediction horizons, the deviation of the predicted trajectory from the ground truth is lower compared to a spatially and socially agnostic model. Even if the performance gain from a spatial-only to a spatial and social context-sensitive model is small in terms of common error measures, by visualizing the results it can be shown that the proposed model in fact is able to predict reactions to surrounding agents and explicitely allows an interpretable behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Emotional Trajectories in Written Stories Utilizing Transformers and Weakly-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02251v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telling stories is an integral part of human communication which can evoke emotions and influence the affective states of the audience. Automatically modeling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal labels for an existing dataset of children's stories originally annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the categorical labels to the continuous valence and arousal space. For predicting the thus obtained emotionality signals, we fine-tune a DeBERTa model and improve upon this baseline via a weakly supervised learning approach. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of $.8221$ for valence and $.7125$ for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach. A detailed analysis shows the extent to which the results vary depending on factors such as the author, the individual story, or the section within the story. In addition, we uncover the weaknesses of our approach by investigating examples that prove to be difficult to predict.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.11382</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling the Cycloid Trajectory of EM Iterations in Mixed Linear Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18237v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the trajectory of iterations and the convergence rates of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In this work, we investigate cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by jointly designing three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and user scheduling. Considering the UAV's onboard energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated in which the average achievable rate of the considered system is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory, transmission power, and user scheduling. Due to the non-convex optimization problem, a lower bound on the average achievable rate is utilized to reduce the complexity of the solution. Subsequently, the original optimization problem is decoupled into four subproblems by using block coordinate descent, and each subproblem is transformed into manageable convex optimization problems by introducing slack variables and successive convex approximation. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the 3D trajectories of UAVs can enhance the average achievable rate of aerial CRNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures,submitted to the IEEE journal for review</p></details> |
| **[Constraint-Aware Diffusion Models for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00990v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion model has shown success in generating high-quality and diverse solutions to trajectory optimization problems. However, diffusion models with neural networks inevitably make prediction errors, which leads to constraint violations such as unmet goals or collisions. This paper presents a novel constraint-aware diffusion model for trajectory optimization. We introduce a novel hybrid loss function for training that minimizes the constraint violation of diffusion samples compared to the groundtruth while recovering the original data distribution. Our model is demonstrated on tabletop manipulation and two-car reach-avoid problems, outperforming traditional diffusion models in minimizing constraint violations while generating samples close to locally optimal solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCF: Cross Correcting Framework for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00749v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting future pedestrian trajectories is crucial across various domains. Due to the uncertainty in future pedestrian trajectories, it is important to learn complex spatio-temporal representations in multi-agent scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Correction Framework (CCF) to learn spatio-temporal representations of pedestrian trajectories better. Our framework consists of two trajectory prediction models, known as subnets, which share the same architecture and are trained with both cross-correction loss and trajectory prediction loss. Cross-correction leverages the learning from both subnets and enables them to refine their underlying representations of trajectories through a mutual correction mechanism. Specifically, we use the cross-correction loss to learn how to correct each other through an inter-subnet interaction. To induce diverse learning among the subnets, we use the transformed observed trajectories produced by a neural network as input to one subnet and the original observed trajectories as input to the other subnet. We utilize transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for each subnet to capture motion and social interaction among pedestrians. The encoder of the transformer captures motion patterns in trajectories, while the decoder focuses on pedestrian interactions with neighbors. Each subnet performs the primary task of predicting future trajectories (a regression task) along with the secondary task of classifying the predicted trajectories (a classification task). Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and SDD demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, CCF, in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. We also conducted several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various modules and loss functions used in our approach.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[An Efficient Trajectory Generation for Bi-copter Flight in Tight Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00671v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike squared (or alike) quadrotors, elongated bi-copters leverage natural superiority in crossing tight spaces. To date, extensive works have focused on the design, modeling, and control of bi-copters. Besides, a proper motion planner utilizing bi-copters' shape characteristics is essential to efficiently and safely traverse tight spaces, yet it has rarely been studied. Current motion planning methods will significantly compromise their ability to traverse narrow spaces if the map is inflated based on the long dimension of the bi-copter. In this paper, we propose an efficient motion planning method that enables the safe navigation of bi-copters through narrow spaces. We first adapt a dynamic, feasible path-finding algorithm with whole-body collision checks to generate a collision-free path. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the position and rotation of the bi-copter to produce a trajectory that is safe, dynamically feasible, and smooth. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have been conducted to verify the reliability and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |
| **[Learning to Approximate Particle Smoothing Trajectories via Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00561v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical systems from sparse observations is critical in numerous fields, including biology, finance, and physics. Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Stabilize Unknown LTI Systems on a Single Trajectory under Stochastic Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00234v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSDO: Enhancing Efficiency and Success in Large-Scale Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20858v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an efficient algorithm, naming Centralized Searching and Decentralized Optimization (CSDO), to find feasible solution for large-scale Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning (MVTP) problem. Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

| **[Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This study proposes a Lane Graph Transformer (LGT) model with structure-aware capabilities. Its key contribution lies in encoding the map topology structure into the attention mechanism. To address variations in lane information from different directions, four Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) matrices are introduced to capture the local details of the map topology structure. Additionally, two Shortest Path Distance (SPD) matrices are employed to capture distance information between two accessible lanes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed LGT model achieves a significantly higher prediction performance on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Specifically, the minFDE$_6$ metric was decreased by 60.73% compared to the Argoverse 2 baseline model (Nearest Neighbor) and the b-minFDE$_6$ metric was reduced by 2.65% compared to the baseline LaneGCN model. Furthermore, ablation experiments demonstrated that the consideration of map topology structure led to a 4.24% drop in the b-minFDE$_6$ metric, validating the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Compositional Models for Estimating Causal Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17714v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world systems can be represented as sets of interacting components. Examples of such systems include computational systems such as query processors, natural systems such as cells, and social systems such as families. Many approaches have been proposed in traditional (associational) machine learning to model such structured systems, including statistical relational models and graph neural networks. Despite this prior work, existing approaches to estimating causal effects typically treat such systems as single units, represent them with a fixed set of variables and assume a homogeneous data-generating process. We study a compositional approach for estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) in structured systems, where each unit is represented by the composition of multiple heterogeneous components. This approach uses a modular architecture to model potential outcomes at each component and aggregates component-level potential outcomes to obtain the unit-level potential outcomes. We discover novel benefits of the compositional approach in causal inference - systematic generalization to estimate counterfactual outcomes of unseen combinations of components and improved overlap guarantees between treatment and control groups compared to the classical methods for causal effect estimation. We also introduce a set of novel environments for empirically evaluating the compositional approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Training of Large Graph Neural Networks with Variable Communication Rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17611v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs presents unique challenges due to the large memory and computing requirements. Distributed GNN training, where the graph is partitioned across multiple machines, is a common approach to training GNNs on large graphs. However, as the graph cannot generally be decomposed into small non-interacting components, data communication between the training machines quickly limits training speeds. Compressing the communicated node activations by a fixed amount improves the training speeds, but lowers the accuracy of the trained GNN. In this paper, we introduce a variable compression scheme for reducing the communication volume in distributed GNN training without compromising the accuracy of the learned model. Based on our theoretical analysis, we derive a variable compression method that converges to a solution equivalent to the full communication case, for all graph partitioning schemes. Our empirical results show that our method attains a comparable performance to the one obtained with full communication. We outperform full communication at any fixed compression ratio for any communication budget.</p></details> |  |

To reduce labeling requirement, the "pre-train, prompt" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of "GraphPrompt: Unifying Pre-Training and Downstream Tasks for Graph Neural Networks". arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.08043</p></details> |

| **[Joint Admission Control and Resource Allocation of Virtual Network Embedding via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17334v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an essential resource management problem in network virtualization, virtual network embedding (VNE) aims to allocate the finite resources of physical network to sequentially arriving virtual network requests (VNRs) with different resource demands. Since this is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, many efforts have been made to provide viable solutions. However, most existing approaches have either ignored the admission control of VNRs, which has a potential impact on long-term performances, or not fully exploited the temporal and topological features of the physical network and VNRs. In this paper, we propose a deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning approach to learn a joint Admission Control and Resource Allocation policy for VNE, named HRL-ACRA. Specifically, the whole VNE process is decomposed into an upper-level policy for deciding whether to admit the arriving VNR or not and a lower-level policy for allocating resources of the physical network to meet the requirement of VNR through the HRL approach. Considering the proximal policy optimization as the basic training algorithm, we also adopt the average reward method to address the infinite horizon problem of the upper-level agent and design a customized multi-objective intrinsic reward to alleviate the sparse reward issue of the lower-level agent. Moreover, we develop a deep feature-aware graph neural network to capture the features of VNR and physical network and exploit a sequence-to-sequence model to generate embedding actions iteratively. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in various settings, and show that HRL-ACRA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both the acceptance ratio and long-term average revenue.

The Distance Recomputator dynamically recalibrates node distances within k-hop neighborhoods using a dynamic encoding scheme, thereby improving the accuracy and adaptability of node representations. Concurrently, the Topology Reconstructor adjusts local graph structures based on computed "similarity distances," optimizing network configurations for improved learning outcomes. These methods address the limitations of static node representations and fixed aggregation schemes in traditional GNNs, offering a more nuanced approach to modeling complex and dynamic graph topologies. Furthermore, our experimental evaluations demonstrate significant performance advantages over existing methods across various benchmark datasets. The proposed Distance Recomputator and Topology Reconstructor not only enhance node relationship modeling accuracy but also optimize information aggregation efficiency through an asynchronous aggregation mechanism. This approach proves particularly effective in scenarios involving dynamic or large-scale graphs, showcasing the methods' robustness and applicability in real-world graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoGCL: Topological Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17251v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a new concept which allows for capitalizing on the strengths of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn rich representations in a wide variety of applications which involve abundant unlabeled information. However, existing GCL approaches largely tend to overlook the important latent information on higher-order graph substructures. We address this limitation by introducing the concepts of topological invariance and extended persistence on graphs to GCL. In particular, we propose a new contrastive mode which targets topological representations of the two augmented views from the same graph, yielded by extracting latent shape properties of the graph at multiple resolutions. Along with the extended topological layer, we introduce a new extended persistence summary, namely, extended persistence landscapes (EPL) and derive its theoretical stability guarantees. Our extensive numerical results on biological, chemical, and social interaction graphs show that the new Topological Graph Contrastive Learning (TopoGCL) model delivers significant performance gains in unsupervised graph classification for 11 out of 12 considered datasets and also exhibits robustness under noisy scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-based Dynamic Multilayer Graph Neural Networks for Loan Default Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00299v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whereas traditional credit scoring tends to employ only individual borrower- or loan-level predictors, it has been acknowledged for some time that connections between borrowers may result in default risk propagating over a network. In this paper, we present a model for credit risk assessment leveraging a dynamic multilayer network built from a Graph Neural Network and a Recurrent Neural Network, each layer reflecting a different source of network connection. We test our methodology in a behavioural credit scoring context using a dataset provided by U.S. mortgage financier Freddie Mac, in which different types of connections arise from the geographical location of the borrower and their choice of mortgage provider. The proposed model considers both types of connections and the evolution of these connections over time. We enhance the model by using a custom attention mechanism that weights the different time snapshots according to their importance. After testing multiple configurations, a model with GAT, LSTM, and the attention mechanism provides the best results. Empirical results demonstrate that, when it comes to predicting probability of default for the borrowers, our proposed model brings both better results and novel insights for the analysis of the importance of connections and timestamps, compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional neural networks, GNNs are capable of capturing complex relationships and dependencies inherent in graph data, making them particularly suited for a wide range of applications including social network analysis, molecular chemistry, and network security. GNNs, with their unique structure and operation, present new computational challenges compared to conventional neural networks. This requires comprehensive benchmarking and a thorough characterization of GNNs to obtain insight into their computational requirements and to identify potential performance bottlenecks. In this thesis, we aim to develop a better understanding of how GNNs interact with the underlying hardware and will leverage this knowledge as we design specialized accelerators and develop new optimizations, leading to more efficient and faster GNN computations. A pivotal component within GNNs is the Sparse General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) kernel, known for its computational intensity and irregular memory access patterns. In this thesis, we address the challenges posed by SpGEMM by implementing a highly optimized hashing-based SpGEMM kernel tailored for a custom accelerator. Synthesizing these insights and optimizations, we design state-of-the-art hardware accelerators capable of efficiently handling various GNN workloads. Our accelerator architectures are built on our characterization of GNN computational demands, providing clear motivation for our approaches. This exploration into novel models underlines our comprehensive approach, as we strive to enable accelerators that are not just performant, but also versatile, able to adapt to the evolving landscape of graph computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>North...</summary><p>Northeastern University Doctoral Dissertation</p></details> |

Conventional methods typically tackle this problem through the assignment of weights to each one of the class samples based on a function of their loss, which can lead to over-fitting on outliers. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning algorithm, named Meta-GCN, for adaptively learning the example weights by simultaneously minimizing the unbiased meta-data set loss and optimizing the model weights through the use of a small unbiased meta-data set. Through experiments, we have shown that Meta-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks and other baselines in terms of accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve, and macro F1-Score for classification tasks on two different datasets.</p></details> |  |

Current large-scale freeway traffic datasets are not designed for anomaly detection and ignore these challenges. In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale lane-level freeway traffic dataset for anomaly detection. Our dataset consists of a month of weekday radar detection sensor data collected in 4 lanes along an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 24 heading toward Nashville, TN, comprising over 3.7 million sensor measurements. We also collect official crash reports from the Nashville Traffic Management Center and manually label all other potential anomalies in the dataset. To show the potential for our dataset to be used in future machine learning and traffic research, we benchmark numerous deep learning anomaly detection models on our dataset. We find that unsupervised graph neural network autoencoders are a promising solution for this problem and that ignoring spatial relationships leads to decreased performance. We demonstrate that our methods can reduce reporting delays by over 10 minutes on average while detecting 75% of crashes. Our dataset and all preprocessing code needed to get started are publicly released at https://vu.edu/ft-aed/ to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GC-Bench: A Benchmark Framework for Graph Condensation with New Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16715v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation (GC) is an emerging technique designed to learn a significantly smaller graph that retains the essential information of the original graph. This condensed graph has shown promise in accelerating graph neural networks while preserving performance comparable to those achieved with the original, larger graphs. Additionally, this technique facilitates downstream applications such as neural architecture search and enhances our understanding of redundancy in large graphs. Despite the rapid development of GC methods, a systematic evaluation framework remains absent, which is necessary to clarify the critical designs for particular evaluative aspects. Furthermore, several meaningful questions have not been investigated, such as whether GC inherently preserves certain graph properties and offers robustness even without targeted design efforts. In this paper, we introduce GC-Bench, a comprehensive framework to evaluate recent GC methods across multiple dimensions and to generate new insights. Our experimental findings provide a deeper insights into the GC process and the characteristics of condensed graphs, guiding future efforts in enhancing performance and exploring new applications.

| **[Link Prediction with Untrained Message Passing Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16687v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) operate on graphs by exchanging information between neigbouring nodes. MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.</p></details> |  |

Backward contact tracing, which tracks the sources of infection, proved crucial in places like Japan for identifying COVID-19 infections from superspreading events. This paper presents a novel perspective of digital contact tracing as online graph exploration and addresses the forward and backward contact tracing problem as a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation problem using iterative epidemic network data sampling. The challenge lies in the combinatorial complexity and rapid spread of infections. We introduce DeepTrace, an algorithm based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that iteratively updates its estimations as new contact tracing data is collected, learning to optimize the maximum likelihood estimation by utilizing topological features to accelerate learning and improve convergence. The contact tracing process combines either BFS or DFS to expand the network and trace the infection source, ensuring comprehensive and efficient exploration. Additionally, the GNN model is fine-tuned through a two-phase approach: pre-training with synthetic networks to approximate likelihood probabilities and fine-tuning with high-quality data to refine the model. Using COVID-19 variant data, we illustrate that DeepTrace surpasses current methods in identifying superspreaders, providing a robust basis for a scalable digital contact tracing strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference of Sequential Patterns for Neural Message Passing in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16552v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modelling of temporal patterns in dynamic graphs is an important current research issue in the development of time-aware GNNs. Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has established that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) deliver impressive outcomes in graph-centric tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite these advancements, challenges like data sparsity and limited generalization capabilities continue to persist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention in natural language processing. They excel in language comprehension and summarization. Integrating LLMs with graph learning techniques has attracted interest as a way to enhance performance in graph learning tasks. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth review of the latest state-of-the-art LLMs applied in graph learning and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize existing methods based on their framework design. We detail four unique designs: i) GNNs as Prefix, ii) LLMs as Prefix, iii) LLMs-Graphs Integration, and iv) LLMs-Only, highlighting key methodologies within each category. We explore the strengths and limitations of each framework, and emphasize potential avenues for future research, including overcoming current integration challenges between LLMs and graph learning techniques, and venturing into new application areas. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners eager to leverage large language models in graph learning, and to inspire continued progress in this dynamic field.

Enormous efforts have been made to exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling spatial correlations and temporal dependencies of traffic speed evolving patterns, regularized by graph topology.While achieving promising results, current traffic speed prediction methods still suffer from ignoring topology-free patterns, which cannot be captured by GNNs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a generic model for enabling the current GNN-based methods to preserve topology-free patterns. Specifically, we first develop a Dual Cross-Scale Transformer (DCST) architecture, including a Spatial Transformer and a Temporal Transformer, to preserve the cross-scale topology-free patterns and associated dynamics, respectively. Then, to further integrate both topology-regularized/-free patterns, we propose a distillation-style learning framework, in which the existing GNN-based methods are considered as the teacher model, and the proposed DCST architecture is considered as the student model. The teacher model would inject the learned topology-regularized patterns into the student model for integrating topology-free patterns. The extensive experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, existing GNAS studies overlook the applications of GNAS in resource-constraint scenarios. This paper proposes to design a joint graph data and architecture mechanism, which identifies important sub-architectures via the valuable graph data. To search for optimal lightweight Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a Lightweight Graph Neural Architecture Search with Graph SparsIfication and Network Pruning (GASSIP) method. In particular, GASSIP comprises an operation-pruned architecture search module to enable efficient lightweight GNN search. Meanwhile, we design a novel curriculum graph data sparsification module with an architecture-aware edge-removing difficulty measurement to help select optimal sub-architectures. With the aid of two differentiable masks, we iteratively optimize these two modules to efficiently search for the optimal lightweight architecture. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GASSIP. Particularly, our method achieves on-par or even higher node classification performance with half or fewer model parameters of searched GNNs and a sparser graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2024.

| **[Multimodal Graph Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16321v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Associating unstructured data with structured information is crucial for real-world tasks that require relevance search. However, existing graph learning benchmarks often overlook the rich semantic information associate with each node. To bridge such gap, we introduce the Multimodal Graph Benchmark (MM-GRAPH), the first comprehensive multi-modal graph benchmark that incorporates both textual and visual information. MM-GRAPH surpasses previous efforts, which have primarily focused on text-attributed graphs with various connectivity patterns. MM-GRAPH consists of five graph learning datasets of various scales that are appropriate for different learning tasks. Their multimodal node features, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of graph learning algorithms in real-world scenarios. To facilitate research on multimodal graph learning, we further provide an extensive study on the performance of various graph neural networks in the presence of features from various modalities. MM-GRAPH aims to foster research on multimodal graph learning and drive the development of more advanced and robust graph learning algorithms. By providing a diverse set of datasets and benchmarks, MM-GRAPH enables researchers to evaluate and compare their models in realistic settings, ultimately leading to improved performance on real-world applications that rely on multimodal graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://mm-graph-benchmark.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Relaxing Continuous Constraints of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Physical Dynamics Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16295v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating Euclidean symmetries (e.g. rotation equivariance) as inductive biases into graph neural networks has improved their generalization ability and data efficiency in unbounded physical dynamics modeling. However, in various scientific and engineering applications, the symmetries of dynamics are frequently discrete due to the boundary conditions. Thus, existing GNNs either overlook necessary symmetry, resulting in suboptimal representation ability, or impose excessive equivariance, which fails to generalize to unobserved symmetric dynamics. In this work, we propose a general Discrete Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DEGNN) that guarantees equivariance to a given discrete point group. Specifically, we show that such discrete equivariant message passing could be constructed by transforming geometric features into permutation-invariant embeddings. Through relaxing continuous equivariant constraints, DEGNN can employ more geometric feature combinations to approximate unobserved physical object interaction functions. Two implementation approaches of DEGNN are proposed based on ranking or pooling permutation-invariant functions. We apply DEGNN to various physical dynamics, ranging from particle, molecular, crowd to vehicle dynamics. In twenty scenarios, DEGNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we show that DEGNN is data efficient, learning with less data, and can generalize across scenarios such as unobserved orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Margin Loss: Proposal and Application in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04614v2)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems guide users through vast amounts of information by suggesting items based on their predicted preferences. Collaborative filtering-based deep learning techniques have regained popularity due to their simplicity, using only user-item interactions. Typically, these systems consist of three main components: an interaction module, a loss function, and a negative sampling strategy. Initially, researchers focused on enhancing performance by developing complex interaction modules with techniques like multi-layer perceptrons, transformers, or graph neural networks. However, there has been a recent shift toward refining loss functions and negative sampling strategies. This shift has increased interest in contrastive learning, which pulls similar pairs closer while pushing dissimilar ones apart. Contrastive learning involves key practices such as heavy data augmentation, large batch sizes, and hard-negative sampling, but these also bring challenges like high memory demands and under-utilization of some negative samples. The proposed Multi-Margin Loss (MML) addresses these challenges by introducing multiple margins and varying weights for negative samples. MML efficiently utilizes not only the hardest negatives but also other non-trivial negatives, offering a simpler yet effective loss function that outperforms more complex methods, especially when resources are limited. Experiments on two well-known datasets showed MML achieved up to a 20\% performance improvement compared to a baseline contrastive loss function with fewer negative samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[F-FOMAML: GNN-Enhanced Meta-Learning for Peak Period Demand Forecasting with Proxy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16221v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand prediction is a crucial task for e-commerce and physical retail businesses, especially during high-stake sales events. However, the limited availability of historical data from these peak periods poses a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages strategically chosen proxy data reflective of potential sales patterns from similar entities during non-peak periods, enriched by features learned from a graph neural networks (GNNs)-based forecasting model, to predict demand during peak events. We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and develop the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods and GNN-generated relational metadata to learn feature-specific layer parameters, thereby adapting to demand forecasts for peak events. Theoretically, we show that by considering domain similarities through task-specific metadata, our model achieves improved generalization, where the excess risk decreases as the number of training tasks increases. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our method demonstrates a notable improvement in demand prediction accuracy, reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 26.24% on an internal vending machine dataset and by 1.04% on the publicly accessible JD.com dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph2Tac: Online Representation Learning of Formal Math Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02949v3)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In proof assistants, the physical proximity between two formal mathematical concepts is a strong predictor of their mutual relevance. Furthermore, lemmas with close proximity regularly exhibit similar proof structures. We show that this locality property can be exploited through online learning techniques to obtain solving agents that far surpass offline learners when asked to prove theorems in an unseen mathematical setting. We extensively benchmark two such online solvers implemented in the Tactician platform for the Coq proof assistant: First, Tactician's online $k$-nearest neighbor solver, which can learn from recent proofs, shows a $1.72\times$ improvement in theorems proved over an offline equivalent. Second, we introduce a graph neural network, Graph2Tac, with a novel approach to build hierarchical representations for new definitions. Graph2Tac's online definition task realizes a $1.5\times$ improvement in theorems solved over an offline baseline. The $k$-NN and Graph2Tac solvers rely on orthogonal online data, making them highly complementary. Their combination improves $1.27\times$ over their individual performances. Both solvers outperform all other general-purpose provers for Coq, including CoqHammer, Proverbot9001, and a transformer baseline by at least $1.48\times$ and are available for practical use by end-users.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Mixture of Weak & Strong Experts on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05185v2)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic graphs contain both (1) rich self-features of nodes and (2) informative structures of neighborhoods, jointly handled by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) in the typical setup. We propose to decouple the two modalities by Mixture of weak and strong experts (Mowst), where the weak expert is a light-weight Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and the strong expert is an off-the-shelf GNN. To adapt the experts' collaboration to different target nodes, we propose a "confidence" mechanism based on the dispersion of the weak expert's prediction logits. The strong expert is conditionally activated in the low-confidence region when either the node's classification relies on neighborhood information, or the weak expert has low model quality. We reveal interesting training dynamics by analyzing the influence of the confidence function on loss: our training algorithm encourages the specialization of each expert by effectively generating soft splitting of the graph. In addition, our "confidence" design imposes a desirable bias toward the strong expert to benefit from GNN's better generalization capability. Mowst is easy to optimize and achieves strong expressive power, with a computation cost comparable to a single GNN. Empirically, Mowst on 4 backbone GNN architectures show significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks, including both homophilous and heterophilous graphs (https://github.com/facebookresearch/mowst-gnn).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Automatic AI Model Selection for Wireless Systems: Online Learning via Digital Twinning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15819v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern wireless network architectures, such as O-RAN, artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications are deployed at intelligent controllers to carry out functionalities like scheduling or power control. The AI "apps" are selected on the basis of contextual information such as network conditions, topology, traffic statistics, and design goals. The mapping between context and AI model parameters is ideally done in a zero-shot fashion via an automatic model selection (AMS) mapping that leverages only contextual information without requiring any current data. This paper introduces a general methodology for the online optimization of AMS mappings. Optimizing an AMS mapping is challenging, as it requires exposure to data collected from many different contexts. Therefore, if carried out online, this initial optimization phase would be extremely time consuming. A possible solution is to leverage a digital twin of the physical system to generate synthetic data from multiple simulated contexts. However, given that the simulator at the digital twin is imperfect, a direct use of simulated data for the optimization of the AMS mapping would yield poor performance when tested in the real system. This paper proposes a novel method for the online optimization of AMS mapping that corrects for the bias of the simulator by means of limited real data collected from the physical system. Experimental results for a graph neural network-based power control app demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for a journal publication</p></details> |
| **[Synergistic Deep Graph Clustering Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15797v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cohesive and discriminative node representations for clustering has shown promising results in deep graph clustering. However, existing methods disregard the reciprocal relationship between representation learning and structure augmentation. This study suggests that enhancing embedding and structure synergistically becomes imperative for GNNs to unleash their potential in deep graph clustering. A reliable structure promotes obtaining more cohesive node representations, while high-quality node representations can guide the augmentation of the structure, enhancing structural reliability in return. Moreover, the generalization ability of existing GNNs-based models is relatively poor. While they perform well on graphs with high homogeneity, they perform poorly on graphs with low homogeneity. To this end, we propose a graph clustering framework named Synergistic Deep Graph Clustering Network (SynC). In our approach, we design a Transform Input Graph Auto-Encoder (TIGAE) to obtain high-quality embeddings for guiding structure augmentation. Then, we re-capture neighborhood representations on the augmented graph to obtain clustering-friendly embeddings and conduct self-supervised clustering. Notably, representation learning and structure augmentation share weights, significantly reducing the number of model parameters. Additionally, we introduce a structure fine-tuning strategy to improve the model's generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. The code is released on GitHub and Code Ocean.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Link Stealing Attacks Against Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16963v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data contains rich node features and unique edge information, which have been applied across various domains, such as citation networks or recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized for handling such data and have shown impressive performance in many applications. However, GNNs may contain of sensitive information and susceptible to privacy attacks. For example, link stealing is a type of attack in which attackers infer whether two nodes are linked or not. Previous link stealing attacks primarily relied on posterior probabilities from the target GNN model, neglecting the significance of node features. Additionally, variations in node classes across different datasets lead to different dimensions of posterior probabilities. The handling of these varying data dimensions posed a challenge in using a single model to effectively conduct link stealing attacks on different datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform link stealing attacks on GNNs. LLMs can effectively integrate textual features and exhibit strong generalizability, enabling attacks to handle diverse data dimensions across various datasets. We design two distinct LLM prompts to effectively combine textual features and posterior probabilities of graph nodes. Through these designed prompts, we fine-tune the LLM to adapt to the link stealing attack task. Furthermore, we fine-tune the LLM using multiple datasets and enable the LLM to learn features from different datasets simultaneously. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of existing link stealing attack tasks in both white-box and black-box scenarios. Our method can execute link stealing attacks across different datasets using only a single model, making link stealing attacks more applicable to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Root Cause Analysis of Anomalies in 5G RAN Using Graph Neural Network and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15638v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of 5G technology marks a significant milestone in developing telecommunication networks, enabling exciting new applications such as augmented reality and self-driving vehicles. However, these improvements bring an increased management complexity and a special concern in dealing with failures, as the applications 5G intends to support heavily rely on high network performance and low latency. Thus, automatic self-healing solutions have become effective in dealing with this requirement, allowing a learning-based system to automatically detect anomalies and perform Root Cause Analysis (RCA). However, there are inherent challenges to the implementation of such intelligent systems. First, there is a lack of suitable data for anomaly detection and RCA, as labelled data for failure scenarios is uncommon. Secondly, current intelligent solutions are tailored to LTE networks and do not fully capture the spatio-temporal characteristics present in the data. Considering this, we utilize a calibrated simulator, Simu5G, and generate open-source data for normal and failure scenarios. Using this data, we propose Simba, a state-of-the-art approach for anomaly detection and root cause analysis in 5G Radio Access Networks (RANs). We leverage Graph Neural Networks to capture spatial relationships while a Transformer model is used to learn the temporal dependencies of the data. We implement a prototype of Simba and evaluate it over multiple failures. The outcomes are compared against existing solutions to confirm the superiority of Simba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sketch-GNN: Scalable Graph Neural Networks with Sublinear Training Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15575v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied to graph learning problems such as node classification. When scaling up the underlying graphs of GNNs to a larger size, we are forced to either train on the complete graph and keep the full graph adjacency and node embeddings in memory (which is often infeasible) or mini-batch sample the graph (which results in exponentially growing computational complexities with respect to the number of GNN layers). Various sampling-based and historical-embedding-based methods are proposed to avoid this exponential growth of complexities. However, none of these solutions eliminates the linear dependence on graph size. This paper proposes a sketch-based algorithm whose training time and memory grow sublinearly with respect to graph size by training GNNs atop a few compact sketches of graph adjacency and node embeddings. Based on polynomial tensor-sketch (PTS) theory, our framework provides a novel protocol for sketching non-linear activations and graph convolution matrices in GNNs, as opposed to existing methods that sketch linear weights or gradients in neural networks. In addition, we develop a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique that can be trained to improve the quality of sketches. Experiments on large-graph benchmarks demonstrate the scalability and competitive performance of our Sketch-GNNs versus their full-size GNN counterparts.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2022 |

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features. We found that our proposed network can consistently outperform the current non-inductive or non-physical model in predicting deep ice layer thickness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exponential Quantum Communication Advantage in Distributed Inference and Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07136v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training and inference with large machine learning models that far exceed the memory capacity of individual devices necessitates the design of distributed architectures, forcing one to contend with communication constraints. We present a framework for distributed computation over a quantum network in which data is encoded into specialized quantum states. We prove that for models within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent can be performed with exponentially less communication compared to their classical analogs, and with relatively modest overhead relative to standard gradient-based methods. We show that certain graph neural networks are particularly amenable to implementation within this framework, and moreover present empirical evidence that they perform well on standard benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first example of exponential quantum advantage for a generic class of machine learning problems that hold regardless of the data encoding cost. Moreover, we show that models in this class can encode highly nonlinear features of their inputs, and their expressivity increases exponentially with model depth. We also delineate the space of models for which exponential communication advantages hold by showing that they cannot hold for linear classification. Our results can be combined with natural privacy advantages in the communicated quantum states that limit the amount of information that can be extracted from them about the data and model parameters. Taken as a whole, these findings form a promising foundation for distributed machine learning over quantum networks.</p></details> |  |

A key desideratum is that these explanations are faithful, i.e., that they portray an accurate picture of the GNN's reasoning process. A number of different faithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what faithfulness is exactly, and what its properties are. We begin by showing that existing metrics are not interchangeable -- i.e., explanations attaining high faithfulness according to one metric may be unfaithful according to others -- and can be systematically insensitive to important properties of the explanation, and suggest how to address these issues. We proceed to show that, surprisingly, optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal. Specifically, we show that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly faithful explanations are completely uninformative. The situation is different for modular GNNs, such as self-explainable and domain-invariant architectures, where optimizing faithfulness does not compromise informativeness, and is also unexpectedly tied to out-of-distribution generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks for Road-Level Traffic Accident Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05072v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic accidents present substantial challenges to human safety and socioeconomic development in urban areas. Developing a reliable and responsible traffic accident prediction model is crucial to addressing growing public safety concerns and enhancing the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of highrisk accidents and the predominance of nonaccident characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of accidents, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of accident risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal ZeroInflated Tweedie Graph Neural Network ,STZITDGNN, the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in roadlevel traffic accident prediction for multi-steps. This model integrates the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family model and the expressive power of graph neural networks. Its decoder innovatively employs a compound Tweedie model, a Poisson distribution to model the frequency of accident occurrences and a Gamma distribution to assess injury severity, supplemented by a zeroinflated component to effectively identify exessive non-incident instances. Empirical tests using realworld traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITDGNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks and metrics, including accident risk value prediction, uncertainty minimisation, nonaccident road identification and accident occurrence accuracy. Our study demonstrates that STZTIDGNN can effectively inform targeted road monitoring, thereby improving urban road safety strategies.</p></details> |  |

The majority of formulations related to graph partitioning exhibit NP-hardness due to their combinatorial nature. Conventional methods, like approximation algorithms or heuristics, are designed for distinct partitioning objectives and fail to achieve generalization across other important partitioning objectives. Recently machine learning-based methods have been developed that learn directly from data. Further, these methods have a distinct advantage of utilizing node features that carry additional information. However, these methods assume differentiability of target partitioning objective functions and cannot generalize for an unknown number of partitions, i.e., they assume the number of partitions is provided in advance. In this study, we develop NeuroCUT with two key innovations over previous methodologies. First, by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based framework over node representations derived from a graph neural network and positional features, NeuroCUT can accommodate any optimization objective, even those with non-differentiable functions. Second, we decouple the parameter space and the partition count making NeuroCUT inductive to any unseen number of partition, which is provided at query time. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that NeuroCUT excels in identifying high-quality partitions, showcases strong generalization across a wide spectrum of partitioning objectives, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen partition count.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining(KDD), 2024</p></details> |

Such negotiation strategies are traditionally based on manual design and heuristics. More recently, reinforcement learning approaches have also been used to train agents to negotiate. However, negotiation problems are diverse, causing observation and action dimensions to change, which cannot be handled by default linear policy networks. Previous work on this topic has circumvented this issue either by fixing the negotiation problem, causing policies to be non-transferable between negotiation problems or by abstracting the observations and actions into fixed-size representations, causing loss of information and expressiveness due to feature design. We developed an end-to-end reinforcement learning method for diverse negotiation problems by representing observations and actions as a graph and applying graph neural networks in the policy. With empirical evaluations, we show that our method is effective and that we can learn to negotiate with other agents on never-before-seen negotiation problems. Our result opens up new opportunities for reinforcement learning in negotiation agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Transferability of Graph Neural Networks using Graphon and Sampling Theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13206v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become powerful tools for processing graph-based information in various domains. A desirable property of GNNs is transferability, where a trained network can swap in information from a different graph without retraining and retain its accuracy. A recent method of capturing transferability of GNNs is through the use of graphons, which are symmetric, measurable functions representing the limit of large dense graphs. In this work, we contribute to the application of graphons to GNNs by presenting an explicit two-layer graphon neural network (WNN) architecture. We prove its ability to approximate bandlimited graphon signals within a specified error tolerance using a minimal number of network weights. We then leverage this result, to establish the transferability of an explicit two-layer GNN over all sufficiently large graphs in a convergent sequence. Our work addresses transferability between both deterministic weighted graphs and simple random graphs and overcomes issues related to the curse of dimensionality that arise in other GNN results. The proposed WNN and GNN architectures offer practical solutions for handling graph data of varying sizes while maintaining performance guarantees without extensive retraining.</p></details> |  |

However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and explore emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art methods treat GSC as a learning-based prediction task using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To capture fine-grained interactions between pair-wise graphs, these methods mostly contain a node-level matching module in the end-to-end learning pipeline, which causes high computational costs in both the training and inference stages. We show that the expensive node-to-node matching module is not necessary for GSC, and high-quality learning can be attained with a simple yet powerful regularization technique, which we call the Alignment Regularization (AReg). In the training stage, the AReg term imposes a node-graph correspondence constraint on the GNN encoder. In the inference stage, the graph-level representations learned by the GNN encoder are directly used to compute the similarity score without using AReg again to speed up inference. We further propose a multi-scale GED discriminator to enhance the expressive ability of the learned representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and transferability of our approach.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2022 |

CPRP is usually formulated into a link-prediction task on a relationship graph of concepts and solved by training the graph neural network (GNN) model. However, current directed GNNs fail to manage graph isomorphism which refers to the invariance of non-isomorphic graphs, reducing the expressivity of resulting representations. We present a permutation-equivariant directed GNN model by introducing the Weisfeiler-Lehman test into directed GNN learning. Our method is then used for CPRP and evaluated on three public datasets. The experimental results show that our model delivers better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1figure, 1 Table (A perprint version)</p></details> |

Discovering how these agents relate to each other can improve our understanding of the often complex dynamics that underlie these systems. Recent works learn to categorize relationships between agents based on observations of their physical behavior. These approaches are limited in that the relationship categories are modelled as independent and mutually exclusive, when in real world systems categories are often interacting. In this work, we introduce a level of abstraction between the physical behavior of agents and the categories that define their behavior. To do this, we learn a mapping from the agents' states to their affinities for each category in a graph neural network. We integrate the physical proximity of agents and their affinities in a nonlinear opinion dynamics model which provides a mechanism to identify mutually exclusive categories, predict an agent's evolution in time, and control an agent's behavior. We demonstrate the utility of our model for learning interpretable categories for mechanical systems, and demonstrate its efficacy on several long-horizon trajectory prediction benchmarks where we consistently out perform existing methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Rethinking Graph Backdoor Attacks: A Distribution-Preserving Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10757v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks. However, recent works reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Generally, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching backdoor triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. A GNN trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes attached with trigger to the target class. Despite their effectiveness, our empirical analysis shows that triggers generated by existing methods tend to be out-of-distribution (OOD), which significantly differ from the clean data. Hence, these injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned with widely used outlier detection methods in real-world applications. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with in-distribution (ID) triggers. To generate ID triggers, we introduce an OOD detector in conjunction with an adversarial learning strategy to generate the attributes of the triggers within distribution. To ensure a high attack success rate with ID triggers, we introduce novel modules designed to enhance trigger memorization by the victim model trained on poisoned graph. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating in distribution triggers that can by-pass various defense strategies while maintaining a high attack success rate.</p></details> | Accepted in KDD 2024 |

We formally formulate the problem as an instance of graph action bandit. We then propose \texttt{GNN-TS}, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) powered Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm which employs a GNN approximator for estimating the mean reward function and the graph neural tangent features for uncertainty estimation. We prove that, under certain boundness assumptions on the reward function, GNN-TS achieves a state-of-the-art regret bound which is (1) sub-linear of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\tilde{d} T)^{1/2})$ in the number of interaction rounds, $T$, and a notion of effective dimension $\tilde{d}$, and (2) independent of the number of graph nodes. Empirical results validate that our proposed \texttt{GNN-TS} exhibits competitive performance and scales well on graph action bandit problems.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks have emerged as promising alternatives, yet the optimal strategies for their design and optimization in real-world biomedical challenges remain unclear. This study evaluates various graph representation learning models for case-control classification using high-throughput biological data from Parkinson's disease and control samples. We compare topologies derived from sample similarity networks and molecular interaction networks, including protein-protein and metabolite-metabolite interactions (PPI, MMI). Graph Convolutional Network (GCNs), Chebyshev spectral graph convolution (ChebyNet), and Graph Attention Network (GAT), are evaluated alongside advanced architectures like graph transformers, the graph U-net, and simpler models like multilayer perceptron (MLP). These models are systematically applied to transcriptomics and metabolomics data independently. Our comparative analysis highlights the benefits and limitations of various architectures in extracting patterns from omics data, paving the way for more accurate and interpretable models in biomedical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Machine Learning in Computational Biology 2024 as an extended abstract, 2 pages + 1 appendix</p></details> |

While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |

Despite their notable successes, GNNs remain susceptible to input perturbations in the form of adversarial attacks. This paper introduces an innovative approach to fortify GNNs against adversarial perturbations through the lens of contractive dynamical systems. Our method introduces graph neural layers based on differential equations with contractive properties, which, as we show, improve the robustness of GNNs. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is the simultaneous learned evolution of both the node features and the adjacency matrix, yielding an intrinsic enhancement of model robustness to perturbations in the input features and the connectivity of the graph. We mathematically derive the underpinnings of our novel architecture and provide theoretical insights to reason about its expected behavior. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through numerous real-world benchmarks, reading on par or improved performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Sizing Field Prediction for Adaptive Mesh Generation From Expert Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14161v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many engineering systems require accurate simulations of complex physical systems. Yet, analytical solutions are only available for simple problems, necessitating numerical approximations such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). The cost and accuracy of the FEM scale with the resolution of the underlying computational mesh. To balance computational speed and accuracy meshes with adaptive resolution are used, allocating more resources to critical parts of the geometry. Currently, practitioners often resort to hand-crafted meshes, which require extensive expert knowledge and are thus costly to obtain. Our approach, Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), views mesh generation as an imitation learning problem. AMBER combines a graph neural network with an online data acquisition scheme to predict the projected sizing field of an expert mesh on a given intermediate mesh, creating a more accurate subsequent mesh. This iterative process ensures efficient and accurate imitation of expert mesh resolutions on arbitrary new geometries during inference. We experimentally validate AMBER on heuristic 2D meshes and 3D meshes provided by a human expert, closely matching the provided demonstrations and outperforming a single-step CNN baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a workshop paper in AI4Science@ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Geometric Self-Supervised Pretraining on 3D Protein Structures using Subgraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14142v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning aims to learn informative protein embeddings capable of addressing crucial biological questions, such as protein function prediction. Although sequence-based transformer models have shown promising results by leveraging the vast amount of protein sequence data in a self-supervised way, there is still a gap in applying these methods to 3D protein structures. In this work, we propose a pre-training scheme going beyond trivial masking methods leveraging 3D and hierarchical structures of proteins. We propose a novel self-supervised method to pretrain 3D graph neural networks on 3D protein structures, by predicting the distances between local geometric centroids of protein subgraphs and the global geometric centroid of the protein. The motivation for this method is twofold. First, the relative spatial arrangements and geometric relationships among different regions of a protein are crucial for its function. Moreover, proteins are often organized in a hierarchical manner, where smaller substructures, such as secondary structure elements, assemble into larger domains. By considering subgraphs and their relationships to the global protein structure, the model can learn to reason about these hierarchical levels of organization. We experimentally show that our proposed pertaining strategy leads to significant improvements in the performance of 3D GNNs in various protein classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve JSSPs, albeit lacking a systematic survey of the relevant literature. This paper aims to thoroughly review prevailing GNN methods for different types of JSSPs and the closely related flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), especially those leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities. We hope this survey can motivate and inspire innovative approaches for more powerful GNN-based approaches in tackling JSSPs and other scheduling problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIGHT: Hierarchical Graph Tokenization for Graph-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14021v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently there has been a surge of interest in extending the success of large language models (LLMs) to graph modality, such as social networks and molecules. As LLMs are predominantly trained with 1D text data, most existing approaches adopt a graph neural network to represent a graph as a series of node tokens and feed these tokens to LLMs for graph-language alignment. Despite achieving some successes, existing approaches have overlooked the hierarchical structures that are inherent in graph data. Especially, in molecular graphs, the high-order structural information contains rich semantics of molecular functional groups, which encode crucial biochemical functionalities of the molecules. We establish a simple benchmark showing that neglecting the hierarchical information in graph tokenization will lead to subpar graph-language alignment and severe hallucination in generated outputs. To address this problem, we propose a novel strategy called HIerarchical GrapH Tokenization (HIGHT). HIGHT employs a hierarchical graph tokenizer that extracts and encodes the hierarchy of node, motif, and graph levels of informative tokens to improve the graph perception of LLMs. HIGHT also adopts an augmented graph-language supervised fine-tuning dataset, enriched with the hierarchical graph information, to further enhance the graph-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 7 molecule-centric benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of HIGHT in reducing hallucination by 40%, as well as significant improvements in various molecule-language downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version of an ongoing project: https://higraphllm.github.io/</p></details> |

Large graphs with high-dimensional features become common and training GNNs on them is non-trivial on an ordinary machine. Given a gigantic graph, even sample-based GNN training cannot work efficiently, since it is difficult to keep the graph's entire data in memory during the training process. Leveraging a solid-state drive (SSD) or other storage devices to extend the memory space has been studied in training GNNs. Memory and I/Os are hence critical for effectual disk-based training. We find that state-of-the-art (SoTA) disk-based GNN training systems severely suffer from issues like the memory contention between a graph's topological and feature data, and severe I/O congestion upon loading data from SSD for training. We accordingly develop GNNDrive. GNNDrive 1) minimizes the memory footprint with holistic buffer management across sampling and extracting, and 2) avoids I/O congestion through a strategy of asynchronous feature extraction. It also avoids costly data preparation on the critical path and makes the most of software and hardware resources. Experiments show that GNNDrive achieves superior performance. For example, when training with the Papers100M dataset and GraphSAGE model, GNNDrive is faster than SoTA PyG+, Ginex, and MariusGNN by 16.9x, 2.6x, and 2.7x, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a full version for the paper with almost the same title accepted by the 53rd International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP 2024)</p></details> |

This dependency presents a significant barrier to rapid innovation. Recognizing the complexity of automatically generating neural network architecture from scratch, we introduce Younger, a pioneering dataset to advance this ambitious goal. Derived from over 174K real-world models across more than 30 tasks from various public model hubs, Younger includes 7,629 unique architectures, and each is represented as a directed acyclic graph with detailed operator-level information. The dataset facilitates two primary design paradigms: global, for creating complete architectures from scratch, and local, for detailed architecture component refinement. By establishing these capabilities, Younger contributes to a new frontier, Artificial Intelligence-Generated Neural Network Architecture (AIGNNA). Our experiments explore the potential and effectiveness of Younger for automated architecture generation and, as a secondary benefit, demonstrate that Younger can serve as a benchmark dataset, advancing the development of graph neural networks.

Therefore, the design of robust GNNs has attracted increasing attention. However, existing research has mainly been conducted via experimental trial and error, and thus far, there remains a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability of GNNs. To address this limitation, we systematically investigate the adversarial robustness of GNNs by considering graph data patterns, model-specific factors, and the transferability of adversarial examples. Through extensive experiments, a set of principled guidelines is obtained for improving the adversarial robustness of GNNs, for example: (i) rather than highly regular graphs, the training graph data with diverse structural patterns is crucial for model robustness, which is consistent with the concept of adversarial training; (ii) the large model capacity of GNNs with sufficient training data has a positive effect on model robustness, and only a small percentage of neurons in GNNs are affected by adversarial attacks; (iii) adversarial transfer is not symmetric and the adversarial examples produced by the small-capacity model have stronger adversarial transferability. This work illuminates the vulnerabilities of GNNs and opens many promising avenues for designing robust GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Pure Transformer Pretraining Framework on Text-attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13873v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining plays a pivotal role in acquiring generalized knowledge from large-scale data, achieving remarkable successes as evidenced by large models in CV and NLP. However, progress in the graph domain remains limited due to fundamental challenges such as feature heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity. Recently, increasing efforts have been made to enhance node feature quality with Large Language Models (LLMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), demonstrating superiority to traditional bag-of-words or word2vec techniques. These high-quality node features reduce the previously critical role of graph structure, resulting in a modest performance gap between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and structure-agnostic Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Motivated by this, we introduce a feature-centric pretraining perspective by treating graph structure as a prior and leveraging the rich, unified feature space to learn refined interaction patterns that generalizes across graphs. Our framework, Graph Sequence Pretraining with Transformer (GSPT), samples node contexts through random walks and employs masked feature reconstruction to capture pairwise proximity in the LLM-unified feature space using a standard Transformer. By utilizing unified text representations rather than varying structures, our framework achieves significantly better transferability among graphs within the same domain. GSPT can be easily adapted to both node classification and link prediction, demonstrating promising empirical success on various datasets.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, in many domains, it is highly desirable to derive data-driven global explanations or rules that can better explain the high-level properties of the models and data in question. However, evaluating global counterfactual explanations is hard in real-world datasets due to a lack of human-annotated ground truth, which limits their use in areas like molecular sciences. Additionally, the increasing scale of these datasets provides a challenge for random search-based methods. In this paper, we develop a novel global explanation model RLHEX for molecular property prediction. It aligns the counterfactual explanations with human-defined principles, making the explanations more interpretable and easy for experts to evaluate. RLHEX includes a VAE-based graph generator to generate global explanations and an adapter to adjust the latent representation space to human-defined principles. Optimized by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the global explanations produced by RLHEX cover 4.12% more input graphs and reduce the distance between the counterfactual explanation set and the input set by 0.47% on average across three molecular datasets. RLHEX provides a flexible framework to incorporate different human-designed principles into the counterfactual explanation generation process, aligning these explanations with domain expertise. The code and data are released at https://github.com/dqwang122/RLHEX.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

We consider large-scale pre-training and downstream tasks on both experimental and predicted structures to enable the systematic evaluation of the quality of the learned structural representation and their usefulness in capturing functional relationships for downstream tasks. We find that: (1) large-scale pretraining on AlphaFold structures and auxiliary tasks consistently improve the performance of both rotation-invariant and equivariant GNNs, and (2) more expressive equivariant GNNs benefit from pretraining to a greater extent compared to invariant models. We aim to establish a common ground for the machine learning and computational biology communities to rigorously compare and advance protein structure representation learning. Our open-source codebase reduces the barrier to entry for working with large protein structure datasets by providing: (1) storage-efficient dataloaders for large-scale structural databases including AlphaFoldDB and ESM Atlas, as well as (2) utilities for constructing new tasks from the entire PDB.

| **[Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks with Post-hoc Explanations for Multi-modal and Explainable Land Use Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13724v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban land use inference is a critically important task that aids in city planning and policy-making. Recently, the increased use of sensor and location technologies has facilitated the collection of multi-modal mobility data, offering valuable insights into daily activity patterns. Many studies have adopted advanced data-driven techniques to explore the potential of these multi-modal mobility data in land use inference. However, existing studies often process samples independently, ignoring the spatial correlations among neighbouring objects and heterogeneity among different services. Furthermore, the inherently low interpretability of complex deep learning methods poses a significant barrier in urban planning, where transparency and extrapolability are crucial for making long-term policy decisions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an explainable framework for inferring land use that synergises heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNs) with Explainable AI techniques, enhancing both accuracy and explainability. The empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed HGNs significantly outperform baseline graph neural networks for all six land-use indicators, especially in terms of 'office' and 'sustenance'. As explanations, we consider feature attribution and counterfactual explanations. The analysis of feature attribution explanations shows that the symmetrical nature of the `residence' and 'work' categories predicted by the framework aligns well with the commuter's 'work' and 'recreation' activities in London. The analysis of the counterfactual explanations reveals that variations in node features and types are primarily responsible for the differences observed between the predicted land use distribution and the ideal mixed state. These analyses demonstrate that the proposed HGNs can suitably support urban stakeholders in their urban planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |

However, the graph-structured data, inherently rich in structural and domain-specific knowledge, have not yet been gracefully adapted to LLMs. Existing methods either describe the graph with raw text, suffering the loss of graph structural information, or feed Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings directly into LLM at the cost of losing semantic representation. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative, end-to-end modality-aligning framework, equipped with a pretrained Dual-Residual Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (Dr.E). This framework is specifically designed to facilitate token-level alignment with LLMs, enabling an effective translation of the intrinsic `language' of graphs into comprehensible natural language. Our experimental evaluations on standard GNN node classification tasks demonstrate competitive performance against other state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, our framework ensures interpretability, efficiency, and robustness, with its effectiveness further validated under both fine-tuning and few-shot settings. This study marks the first successful endeavor to achieve token-level alignment between GNNs and LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the cloud-edge collaborative environment introduces more difficulties, such as unstable networks and high latency across network segments. Accurately identifying the root cause of microservices in a cloud-edge collaborative environment has thus become an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose MicroCERCL, a novel approach that pinpoints root causes at the kernel and application level in the cloud-edge collaborative environment. Our key insight is that failures propagate through direct invocations and indirect resource-competition dependencies in a cloud-edge collaborative environment characterized by instability and high latency. This will become more complex in the hybrid deployment that simultaneously involves multiple microservice systems. Leveraging this insight, we extract valid contents from kernel-level logs to prioritize localizing the kernel-level root cause. Moreover, we construct a heterogeneous dynamic topology stack and train a graph neural network model to accurately localize the application-level root cause without relying on historical data. Notably, we released the first benchmark hybrid deployment microservice system in a cloud-edge collaborative environment (the largest and most complex within our knowledge). Experiments conducted on the dataset collected from the benchmark show that MicroCERCL can accurately localize the root cause of microservice systems in such environments, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with an increase of at least 24.1% in top-1 accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Model-based RL has emerged as a solution, but its application has largely been confined to single-agent scenarios. In this work, we introduce CoDreamer, an extension of the Dreamer algorithm for multi-agent environments. CoDreamer leverages Graph Neural Networks for a two-level communication system to tackle challenges such as partial observability and inter-agent cooperation. Communication is separately utilised within the learned world models and within the learned policies of each agent to enhance modelling and task-solving. We show that CoDreamer offers greater expressive power than a naive application of Dreamer, and we demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods across various multi-agent environments.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are utilized to extract features by capturing the dependencies within graphs. Despite groundbreaking performances, we argue that Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and fixed activation functions impede the feature extraction due to information loss. Inspired by Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we make the first attempt to GNNs with KANs. We discard MLPs and activation functions, and instead used KANs for feature extraction. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphKAN, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool. Code is available at https://github.com/Ryanfzhang/GraphKan.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks demonstrate proficiency in modeling this type of data, their success is often reliant on significant amounts of labeled data, posing a challenge in practical scenarios with limited annotation resources. To tackle this problem, tremendous efforts have been devoted to enhancing graph machine learning performance under low-resource settings by exploring various approaches to minimal supervision. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of Data-Efficient Graph Learning (DEGL) as a research frontier, and present the first survey that summarizes the current progress of DEGL. We initiate by highlighting the challenges inherent in training models with large labeled data, paving the way for our exploration into DEGL. Next, we systematically review recent advances on this topic from several key aspects, including self-supervised graph learning, semi-supervised graph learning, and few-shot graph learning.

The proposed approach leverages the weather forecasts generated by GraphCast and trains a neural network model to predict the ratio of actual solar output to potential solar output based on various weather conditions. The model architecture consists of an input layer corresponding to weather features (temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed, rain, barometric pressure, and altitude), two hidden layers with ReLU activations, and an output layer predicting solar radiation. The model is trained using a mean absolute error loss function and Adam optimizer. The results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting solar radiation, with its convergence behavior, decreasing training loss, and accurate prediction of solar radiation patterns suggesting successful learning of the underlying relationships between weather conditions and solar radiation. The integration of solar energy production forecasting with GraphCast offers valuable insights for the renewable energy sector, enabling better planning and decision-making based on expected solar energy production. Future work could explore further model refinements, incorporation of additional weather variables, and extension to other renewable energy sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, project website: http://solarcast-ml.com/</p></details> |
| **[One Fits All: Learning Fair Graph Neural Networks for Various Sensitive Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13544v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have highlighted fairness issues in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where they produce discriminatory predictions against specific protected groups categorized by sensitive attributes such as race and age. While various efforts to enhance GNN fairness have made significant progress, these approaches are often tailored to specific sensitive attributes. Consequently, they necessitate retraining the model from scratch to accommodate changes in the sensitive attribute requirement, resulting in high computational costs. To gain deeper insights into this issue, we approach the graph fairness problem from a causal modeling perspective, where we identify the confounding effect induced by the sensitive attribute as the underlying reason. Motivated by this observation, we formulate the fairness problem in graphs from an invariant learning perspective, which aims to learn invariant representations across environments. Accordingly, we propose a graph fairness framework based on invariant learning, namely FairINV, which enables the training of fair GNNs to accommodate various sensitive attributes within a single training session. Specifically, FairINV incorporates sensitive attribute partition and trains fair GNNs by eliminating spurious correlations between the label and various sensitive attributes. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that FairINV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fairness approaches, underscoring its effectiveness. Our code is available via: https://github.com/ZzoomD/FairINV/.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

However, GNNs are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Numerous adversarial defense methods on GNNs are proposed to address the problem of adversarial attacks. However, these methods can only serve as a defense before poisoning, but cannot repair poisoned GNN. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a method to repair poisoned GNN. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the novel concept of model repair for GNNs. We propose a repair framework, Repairing Robustness of Graph Neural Networks via Machine Unlearning (GraphMU), which aims to fine-tune poisoned GNN to forget adversarial samples without the need for complete retraining. We also introduce a unlearning validation method to ensure that our approach effectively forget specified poisoned data. To evaluate the effectiveness of GraphMU, we explore three fine-tuned subgraph construction scenarios based on the available perturbation information: (i) Known Perturbation Ratios, (ii) Known Complete Knowledge of Perturbations, and (iii) Unknown any Knowledge of Perturbations. Our extensive experiments, conducted across four citation datasets and four adversarial attack scenarios, demonstrate that GraphMU can effectively restore the performance of poisoned GNN.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

One critical challenge of KG inductive reasoning is handling low-resource scenarios with scarcity in both textual and structural aspects. In this paper, we attempt to address this challenge with Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we utilize the state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a graph-structural prompt to enhance the pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which brings us new methodological insights into the KG inductive reasoning methods, as well as high generalizability in practice. On the methodological side, we introduce a novel pretraining and prompting framework ProLINK, designed for low-resource inductive reasoning across arbitrary KGs without requiring additional training. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate our approach on 36 low-resource KG datasets and find that ProLINK outperforms previous methods in three-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot reasoning tasks, exhibiting average performance improvements by 20%, 45%, and 147%, respectively. Furthermore, ProLINK demonstrates strong robustness for various LLM promptings as well as full-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL2024</p></details> |

Existing studies usually utilize in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning on task-specific data to align LLMs into recommendations. However, the substantial bias in semantic spaces between language processing tasks and recommendation tasks poses a nonnegligible challenge. Specifically, without the adequate capturing ability of collaborative information, existing modeling paradigms struggle to capture behavior patterns within community groups, leading to LLMs' ineffectiveness in discerning implicit interaction semantic in recommendation scenarios. To address this, we consider enhancing the learning capability of language model-driven recommendation models for structured data, specifically by utilizing interaction graphs rich in collaborative semantics. We propose a Graph-Aware Learning for Language Model-Driven Recommendations (GAL-Rec). GAL-Rec enhances the understanding of user-item collaborative semantics by imitating the intent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to aggregate multi-hop information, thereby fully exploiting the substantial learning capacity of LLMs to independently address the complex graphs in the recommendation system. Sufficient experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GAL-Rec significantly enhances the comprehension of collaborative semantics, and improves recommendation performance.</p></details> | 10pages |
| **[AGSOA:Graph Neural Network Targeted Attack Based on Average Gradient and Structure Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13228v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attack that cause performance degradation by adding small perturbations to the graph. Gradient-based attacks are one of the most commonly used methods and have achieved good performance in many attack scenarios. However, current gradient attacks face the problems of easy to fall into local optima and poor attack invisibility. Specifically, most gradient attacks use greedy strategies to generate perturbations, which tend to fall into local optima leading to underperformance of the attack. In addition, many attacks only consider the effectiveness of the attack and ignore the invisibility of the attack, making the attacks easily exposed leading to failure. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an attack on GNNs, called AGSOA, which consists of an average gradient calculation and a structre optimization module. In the average gradient calculation module, we compute the average of the gradient information over all moments to guide the attack to generate perturbed edges, which stabilizes the direction of the attack update and gets rid of undesirable local maxima. In the structure optimization module, we calculate the similarity and homogeneity of the target node's with other nodes to adjust the graph structure so as to improve the invisibility and transferability of the attack. Extensive experiments on three commonly used datasets show that AGSOA improves the misclassification rate by 2$\%$-8$\%$ compared to other state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Networks based on Graph Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13214v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN) have the ability to capture both the graph topology and dynamic dependencies of interactions within a graph over time. There has been a growing need to explain the predictions of TGNN models due to the difficulty in identifying how past events influence their predictions. Since the explanation model for a static graph cannot be readily applied to temporal graphs due to its inability to capture temporal dependencies, recent studies proposed explanation models for temporal graphs. However, existing explanation models for temporal graphs rely on post-hoc explanations, requiring separate models for prediction and explanation, which is limited in two aspects: efficiency and accuracy of explanation. In this work, we propose a novel built-in explanation framework for temporal graphs, called Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Networks based on Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). TGIB provides explanations for event occurrences by introducing stochasticity in each temporal event based on the Information Bottleneck theory. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TGIB in terms of both the link prediction performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. This is the first work that simultaneously performs prediction and explanation for temporal graphs in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> | KDD 2024 |

However, the increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs presents a significant challenge for GNN training due to their computational demands, limiting the applicability of GNNs in various scenarios. In response to this challenge, graph condensation (GC) is proposed as a promising acceleration solution, focusing on generating an informative compact graph that enables efficient training of GNNs while retaining performance. Despite the potential to accelerate GNN training, existing GC methods overlook the quality of large training graphs during both the training and inference stages. They indiscriminately emulate the training graph distributions, making the condensed graphs susceptible to noises within the training graph and significantly impeding the application of GC in intricate real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose robust graph condensation (RobGC), a plug-and-play approach for GC to extend the robustness and applicability of condensed graphs in noisy graph structure environments. Specifically, RobGC leverages the condensed graph as a feedback signal to guide the denoising process on the original training graph. A label propagation-based alternating optimization strategy is in place for the condensation and denoising processes, contributing to the mutual purification of the condensed graph and training graph. Additionally, as a GC method designed for inductive graph inference, RobGC facilitates test-time graph denoising by leveraging the noise-free condensed graph to calibrate the structure of the test graph. Extensive experiments show that RobGC is compatible with various GC methods, significantly boosting their robustness under different types and levels of graph structural noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Combinatorial Optimization Based on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13125v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), exhibiting state-of-the-art performance in both graph-structured and non-graph-structured domains. However, existing approaches lack a unified framework capable of addressing a wide range of COPs. After presenting a summary of representative COPs and a brief review of recent advancements in GNNs for solving COPs, this paper proposes a unified framework for solving COPs based on GNNs, including graph representation of COPs, equivalent conversion of non-graph structured COPs to graph-structured COPs, graph decomposition, and graph simplification. The proposed framework leverages the ability of GNNs to effectively capture the relational information and extract features from the graph representation of COPs, offering a generic solution to COPs that can address the limitations of state-of-the-art in solving non-graph-structured and highly complex graph-structured COPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining Strategy for Neural Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15921v2)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a mask pretraining method for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their performance on fitting potential energy surfaces, particularly in water systems. GNNs are pretrained by recovering spatial information related to masked-out atoms from molecules, then transferred and finetuned on atomic forcefields. Through such pretraining, GNNs learn meaningful prior about structural and underlying physical information of molecule systems that are useful for downstream tasks. From comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and convergence speed compared to GNNs trained from scratch or using other pretraining techniques such as denoising. On the other hand, our pretraining method is suitable for both energy-centric and force-centric GNNs. This approach showcases its potential to enhance the performance and data efficiency of GNNs in fitting molecular force fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Signed Propagation of Graph Neural Network Under Multiple Classes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08918v6)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which collect information from adjacent nodes achieve dismal performance on heterophilic graphs. Various schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, and propagating signed information on heterophilic edges has gained great attention. Recently, some works provided theoretical analysis that signed propagation always leads to performance improvement under a binary class scenario. However, we notice that prior analyses do not align well with multi-class benchmark datasets. This paper provides a new understanding of signed propagation for multi-class scenarios and points out two drawbacks in terms of message-passing and parameter update: (1) Message-passing: if two nodes belong to different classes but have a high similarity, signed propagation can decrease the separability. (2) Parameter update: the prediction uncertainty (e.g., conflict evidence) of signed neighbors increases during training, which can impede the stability of the algorithm. Based on the observation, we introduce two novel strategies for improving signed propagation under multi-class graphs. The proposed scheme combines calibration to secure robustness while reducing uncertainty. We show the efficacy of our theorem through extensive experiments on six benchmark graph datasets.</p></details> |  |

These AI models combine hybrid dilated convolution neural networks to accurately model both short- and long-range temporal sequential information of gravitational waves; and graph neural networks to capture spatial correlations among gravitational wave observatories to consistently describe and identify the presence of a signal in a three detector network encompassing the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. We first trained these spatiotemporal-graph AI models using synthetic noise, using 1.2 million modeled waveforms to densely sample this signal manifold, within 1.7 hours using 256 A100 GPUs in the Polaris supercomputer at the ALCF. Our distributed training approach had optimal performance, and strong scaling up to 512 A100 GPUs. With these AI ensembles we processed data from a three detector network, and found that an ensemble of 4 AI models achieves state-of-the-art performance for signal detection, and reports two misclassifications for every decade of searched data. We distributed AI inference over 128 GPUs in the Polaris supercomputer and 128 nodes in the Theta supercomputer, and completed the processing of a decade of gravitational wave data from a three detector network within 3.5 hours. Finally, we fine-tuned these AI ensembles to process the entire month of February 2020, which is part of the O3b LIGO/Virgo observation run, and found 6 gravitational waves, concurrently identified in Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data, and zero false positives.

Results show RCDGCN outperformed baseline methods in forecasting accuracy.

We introduce a graph neural network (GNN) approach that emulates the problem's combinatorially-complex optimal online algorithm, which selects actions (e.g., which nodes to match) by computing each action's value-to-go (VTG) -- the expected weight of the final matching if the algorithm takes that action, then acts optimally in the future. We train a GNN to estimate VTG and show empirically that this GNN returns high-weight matchings across a variety of tasks. Moreover, we identify a common family of graph distributions in spatial crowdsourcing applications, such as rideshare, under which VTG can be efficiently approximated by aggregating information within local neighborhoods in the graphs. This structure matches the local behavior of GNNs, providing theoretical justification for our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024; Hardness result from introduction made precise</p></details> |

They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |

Through a series of experiments, the research addresses key questions about the suitability of different configurations and subsets of data in enhancing the prediction accuracy of GNN models.

Data is the focus for developing deep learning algorithms.

Research in this field generally consist of two main perspectives: local-level encoding and global-level aggregating, respectively refer to textual node information unification (e.g., using Language Models) and structure-augmented modeling (e.g., using Graph Neural Networks). Most existing works focus on combining different information levels but overlook the interconnections, i.e., the contextual textual information among nodes, which provides semantic insights to bridge local and global levels. In this paper, we propose GraphBridge, a multi-granularity integration framework that bridges local and global perspectives by leveraging contextual textual information, enhancing fine-grained understanding of TAGs. Besides, to tackle scalability and efficiency challenges, we introduce a graphaware token reduction module. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets show that our method achieves state-of-theart performance, while our graph-aware token reduction module significantly enhances efficiency and solves scalability issues.</p></details> |  |

However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large number of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for unseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a perspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction tasks. This enables building a versatile and specialized LLM that can be adapted to novel MPP tasks without any fine-tuning through zero- and few-shot in-context learning (ICL). MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context reasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new benchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks. More importantly, with just two-shot examples, MolecularGPT can outperform standard supervised graph neural network methods on 4 out of 7 datasets. It also excels state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 16.6% increase on classification accuracy and decrease of 199.17 on regression metrics (e.g., RMSE) under zero-shot. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as effective few-shot molecular property predictors. The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/MolecularGPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375v2)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on the attention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist in leveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper link predictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. We will implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcase benchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, not published nor submitted yet</p></details> |

Nevertheless, existing methods often fall short of accurately replicating the original graph for certain datasets, thereby failing to achieve the objective of lossless condensation. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the potential reasons and reveal that the previous state-of-the-art trajectory matching method provides biased and restricted supervision signals from the original graph when optimizing the condensed one. This significantly limits both the scale and efficacy of the condensed graph. In this paper, we make the first attempt toward \textit{lossless graph condensation} by bridging the previously neglected supervision signals. Specifically, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to train expert trajectories with more diverse supervision signals from the original graph, and then effectively transfer the information into the condensed graph with expanding window matching. Moreover, we design a loss function to further extract knowledge from the expert trajectories. Theoretical analysis justifies the design of our method and extensive experiments verify its superiority across different datasets. Code is released at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/GEOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lossl...</summary><p>Lossless graph condensation method</p></details> |
| **[The Heterophilic Snowflake Hypothesis: Training and Empowering GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12539v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become pivotal tools for a range of graph-based learning tasks. Notably, most current GNN architectures operate under the assumption of homophily, whether explicitly or implicitly. While this underlying assumption is frequently adopted, it is not universally applicable, which can result in potential shortcomings in learning effectiveness. In this paper, \textbf{for the first time}, we transfer the prevailing concept of ``one node one receptive field" to the heterophilic graph. By constructing a proxy label predictor, we enable each node to possess a latent prediction distribution, which assists connected nodes in determining whether they should aggregate their associated neighbors. Ultimately, every node can have its own unique aggregation hop and pattern, much like each snowflake is unique and possesses its own characteristics. Based on observations, we innovatively introduce the Heterophily Snowflake Hypothesis and provide an effective solution to guide and facilitate research on heterophilic graphs and beyond. We conduct comprehensive experiments including (1) main results on 10 graphs with varying heterophily ratios across 10 backbones; (2) scalability on various deep GNN backbones (SGC, JKNet, etc.) across various large number of layers (2,4,6,8,16,32 layers); (3) comparison with conventional snowflake hypothesis; (4) efficiency comparison with existing graph pruning algorithms. Our observations show that our framework acts as a versatile operator for diverse tasks. It can be integrated into various GNN frameworks, boosting performance in-depth and offering an explainable approach to choosing the optimal network depth.

| **[A data-centric approach for assessing progress of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12439v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in node classification tasks. However, most improvements are in multi-class classification, with less focus on the cases where each node could have multiple labels. The first challenge in studying multi-label node classification is the scarcity of publicly available datasets. To address this, we collected and released three real-world biological datasets and developed a multi-label graph generator with tunable properties. We also argue that traditional notions of homophily and heterophily do not apply well to multi-label scenarios. Therefore, we define homophily and Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity for multi-label classification and investigate $9$ collected multi-label datasets. Lastly, we conducted a large-scale comparative study with $8$ methods across nine datasets to evaluate current progress in multi-label node classification. We release our code at \url{https://github.com/Tianqi-py/MLGNC}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning with Limited Node Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12435v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph federated learning (SFL) is a research methodology that has gained significant attention for its potential to handle distributed graph-structured data. In SFL, the local model comprises graph neural networks (GNNs) with a partial graph structure. However, some SFL models have overlooked the significance of missing cross-subgraph edges, which can lead to local GNNs being unable to message-pass global representations to other parties' GNNs. Moreover, existing SFL models require substantial labeled data, which limits their practical applications. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel SFL framework called FedMpa that aims to learn cross-subgraph node representations. FedMpa first trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model using a small amount of data and then propagates the federated feature to the local structures. To further improve the embedding representation of nodes with local subgraphs, we introduce the FedMpae method, which reconstructs the local graph structure with an innovation view that applies pooling operation to form super-nodes. Our extensive experiments on six graph datasets demonstrate that FedMpa is highly effective in node classification. Furthermore, our ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of FedMpa.</p></details> |  |

Radar raw data often contains excessive noise, whereas radar point clouds retain only limited information. In this work, we holistically treat the sparse nature of radar data by introducing an adaptive subsampling method together with a tailored network architecture that exploits the sparsity patterns to discover global and local dependencies in the radar signal. Our subsampling module selects a subset of pixels from range-doppler (RD) spectra that contribute most to the downstream perception tasks. To improve the feature extraction on sparse subsampled data, we propose a new way of applying graph neural networks on radar data and design a novel two-branch backbone to capture both global and local neighbor information. An attentive fusion module is applied to combine features from both branches. Experiments on the RADIal dataset show that our SparseRadNet exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in object detection and achieves close to SOTA accuracy in freespace segmentation, meanwhile using sparse subsampled input data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[How Graph Neural Networks Learn: Lessons from Training Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05105v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing goal in deep learning has been to characterize the learning behavior of black-box models in a more interpretable manner. For graph neural networks (GNNs), considerable advances have been made in formalizing what functions they can represent, but whether GNNs will learn desired functions during the optimization process remains less clear. To fill this gap, we study their training dynamics in function space. In particular, we find that the gradient descent optimization of GNNs implicitly leverages the graph structure to update the learned function, as can be quantified by a phenomenon which we call \emph{kernel-graph alignment}. We provide theoretical explanations for the emergence of this phenomenon in the overparameterized regime and empirically validate it on real-world GNNs. This finding offers new interpretable insights into when and why the learned GNN functions generalize, highlighting their limitations in heterophilic graphs. Practically, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that directly uses a sparse matrix (i.e. graph adjacency) to update the learned function. We demonstrate that this embarrassingly simple approach can be as effective as GNNs while being orders-of-magnitude faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Graph Consistency: Going Beyond Patches for Regularizing Self-Supervised Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12944v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) with vision transformers (ViTs) has proven effective for representation learning as demonstrated by the impressive performance on various downstream tasks. Despite these successes, existing ViT-based SSL architectures do not fully exploit the ViT backbone, particularly the patch tokens of the ViT. In this paper, we introduce a novel Semantic Graph Consistency (SGC) module to regularize ViT-based SSL methods and leverage patch tokens effectively. We reconceptualize images as graphs, with image patches as nodes and infuse relational inductive biases by explicit message passing using Graph Neural Networks into the SSL framework. Our SGC loss acts as a regularizer, leveraging the underexploited patch tokens of ViTs to construct a graph and enforcing consistency between graph features across multiple views of an image. Extensive experiments on various datasets including ImageNet, RESISC and Food-101 show that our approach significantly improves the quality of learned representations, resulting in a 5-10\% increase in performance when limited labeled data is used for linear evaluation. These experiments coupled with a comprehensive set of ablations demonstrate the promise of our approach in various settings.</p></details> |  |

Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) are widely used in multivariate time series forecasting tasks and have achieved promising performance on multiple real-world datasets for their ability to model the underlying complex spatial and temporal dependencies. However, existing studies have mainly focused on datasets comprising only a few hundred sensors due to the heavy computational cost and memory cost of spatial-temporal GNNs. When applied to larger datasets, these methods fail to capture the underlying complex spatial dependencies and exhibit limited scalability and performance. To this end, we present a Scalable Adaptive Graph Diffusion Forecasting Network (SAGDFN) to capture complex spatial-temporal correlation for large-scale multivariate time series and thereby, leading to exceptional performance in multivariate time series forecasting tasks. The proposed SAGDFN is scalable to datasets of thousands of nodes without the need of prior knowledge of spatial correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGDFN achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art baselines on one real-world dataset of 207 nodes and outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin on three real-world datasets of 2000 nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Shortcomings in Fair Graph Learning Datasets: Towards a New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06017v2)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fair graph learning plays a pivotal role in numerous practical applications. Recently, many fair graph learning methods have been proposed; however, their evaluation often relies on poorly constructed semi-synthetic datasets or substandard real-world datasets. In such cases, even a basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) can outperform Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in both utility and fairness. In this work, we illustrate that many datasets fail to provide meaningful information in the edges, which may challenge the necessity of using graph structures in these problems. To address these issues, we develop and introduce a collection of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets that fulfill a broad spectrum of requirements. These datasets are thoughtfully designed to include relevant graph structures and bias information crucial for the fair evaluation of models. The proposed synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets offer the flexibility to create data with controllable bias parameters, thereby enabling the generation of desired datasets with user-defined bias values with ease. Moreover, we conduct systematic evaluations of these proposed datasets and establish a unified evaluation approach for fair graph learning models. Our extensive experimental results with fair graph learning methods across our datasets demonstrate their effectiveness in benchmarking the performance of these methods. Our datasets and the code for reproducing our experiments are available at https://github.com/XweiQ/Benchmark-GraphFairness.</p></details> | KDD ADS 2024 |
| **[Self-supervised Graph Neural Network for Mechanical CAD Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08863v2)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CAD (Computer-Aided Design) plays a crucial role in mechanical industry, where large numbers of similar-shaped CAD parts are often created. Efficiently reusing these parts is key to reducing design and production costs for enterprises. Retrieval systems are vital for achieving CAD reuse, but the complex shapes of CAD models are difficult to accurately describe using text or keywords, making traditional retrieval methods ineffective. While existing representation learning approaches have been developed for CAD, manually labeling similar samples in these methods is expensive. Additionally, CAD models' unique parameterized data structure presents challenges for applying existing 3D shape representation learning techniques directly. In this work, we propose GC-CAD, a self-supervised contrastive graph neural network-based method for mechanical CAD retrieval that directly models parameterized CAD raw files. GC-CAD consists of two key modules: structure-aware representation learning and contrastive graph learning framework. The method leverages graph neural networks to extract both geometric and topological information from CAD models, generating feature representations. We then introduce a simple yet effective contrastive graph learning framework approach, enabling the model to train without manual labels and generate retrieval-ready representations. Experimental results on four datasets including human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements and up to 100 times efficiency improvement over the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Graph Neural Network Meets Causality: Opportunities, Methodologies and An Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12477v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful representation learning tools for capturing complex dependencies within diverse graph-structured data. Despite their success in a wide range of graph mining tasks, GNNs have raised serious concerns regarding their trustworthiness, including susceptibility to distribution shift, biases towards certain populations, and lack of explainability. Recently, integrating causal learning techniques into GNNs has sparked numerous ground-breaking studies since many GNN trustworthiness issues can be alleviated by capturing the underlying data causality rather than superficial correlations. In this survey, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on Causality-Inspired GNNs (CIGNNs). Specifically, we first employ causal tools to analyze the primary trustworthiness risks of existing GNNs, underscoring the necessity for GNNs to comprehend the causal mechanisms within graph data. Moreover, we introduce a taxonomy of CIGNNs based on the type of causal learning capability they are equipped with, i.e., causal reasoning and causal representation learning. Besides, we systematically introduce typical methods within each category and discuss how they mitigate trustworthiness risks. Finally, we summarize useful resources and discuss several future directions, hoping to shed light on new research opportunities in this emerging field.

This reduction in model complexity allows coarse-grained molecular simulations to reach increased spatial and temporal scales compared to corresponding all-atom models. A core challenge in coarse-graining is to construct a force field that represents the interactions in the new representation in a way that preserves the atomistic-level properties. Many approaches to building coarse-grained force fields have limited transferability between different thermodynamic conditions as a result of averaging over internal fluctuations at a specific thermodynamic state point. Here, we use a graph-convolutional neural network architecture, the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network with Tensor Sensitivity (HIP-NN-TS), to develop a highly automated training pipeline for coarse grained force fields which allows for studying the transferability of coarse-grained models based on the force-matching approach. We show that this approach not only yields highly accurate force fields, but also that these force fields are more transferable through a variety of thermodynamic conditions. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks to improve the construction of transferable coarse-grained force fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 figures + TOC figure + SI (15 pages, 3 figures)</p></details> |

Despite the significant task-induced spatiotemporal brain activation fluctuations, most studies on task-based fMRI ignore the task context information aligned with fMRI and consider task-based fMRI a coherent sequence. In this paper, we show that using the task structures as data-driven guidance is effective for spatiotemporal analysis. We propose STNAGNN, a GNN-based spatiotemporal architecture, and validate its performance in an autism classification task. The trained model is also interpreted for identifying autism-related spatiotemporal brain biomarkers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable and Effective Alternative to Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12059v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown impressive performance in graph representation learning, but they face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to their limited expressive power. To address this, Graph Transformers (GTs) were introduced, utilizing self-attention mechanism to effectively model pairwise node relationships. Despite their advantages, GTs suffer from quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes in the graph, hindering their applicability to large graphs. In this work, we present Graph-Enhanced Contextual Operator (GECO), a scalable and effective alternative to GTs that leverages neighborhood propagation and global convolutions to effectively capture local and global dependencies in quasilinear time. Our study on synthetic datasets reveals that GECO reaches 169x speedup on a graph with 2M nodes w.r.t. optimized attention. Further evaluations on diverse range of benchmarks showcase that GECO scales to large graphs where traditional GTs often face memory and time limitations. Notably, GECO consistently achieves comparable or superior quality compared to baselines, improving the SOTA up to 4.5%, and offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[When Box Meets Graph Neural Network in Tag-aware Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12020v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Last year has witnessed the re-flourishment of tag-aware recommender systems supported by the LLM-enriched tags. Unfortunately, though large efforts have been made, current solutions may fail to describe the diversity and uncertainty inherent in user preferences with only tag-driven profiles. Recently, with the development of geometry-based techniques, e.g., box embedding, diversity of user preferences now could be fully modeled as the range within a box in high dimension space. However, defect still exists as these approaches are incapable of capturing high-order neighbor signals, i.e., semantic-rich multi-hop relations within the user-tag-item tripartite graph, which severely limits the effectiveness of user modeling. To deal with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called BoxGNN, to perform the message aggregation via combination of logical operations, thereby incorporating high-order signals. Specifically, we first embed users, items, and tags as hyper-boxes rather than simple points in the representation space, and define two logical operations to facilitate the subsequent process. Next, we perform the message aggregation mechanism via the combination of logical operations, to obtain the corresponding high-order box representations. Finally, we adopt a volume-based learning objective with Gumbel smoothing techniques to refine the representation of boxes. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets and one LLM-enhanced e-commerce dataset have validated the superiority of BoxGNN compared with various state-of-the-art baselines. The code is released online</p></details> |  |
