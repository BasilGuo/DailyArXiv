This paper explores a comprehensive approach to demand forecasting at the origin-destination (O\&D) level, focusing on the development and implementation of machine learning models in decision-making for the air cargo industry. We leverage a mixture of experts framework, combining statistical and advanced deep learning models to provide reliable forecasts for cargo demand over a six-month horizon. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights for cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo industry. While this work is applied in the airline industry, the methodology is broadly applicable to any field where forecast-based decision-making in a volatile environment is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 10th Mining and Learning from Time Series Workshop: From Classical Methods to LLMs. SIGKDD, Barcelona, Spain, 6 page</p></details> |
| **[Local Level Dynamic Random Partition Models for Changepoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20085v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by an increasing demand for models that can effectively describe features of complex multivariate time series, e.g. from sensor data in biomechanics, motion analysis, and sports science, we introduce a novel state-space modeling framework where the state equation encodes the evolution of latent partitions of the data over time. Building on the principles of dynamic linear models, our approach develops a random partition model capable of linking data partitions to previous ones over time, using a straightforward Markov structure that accounts for temporal persistence and facilitates changepoint detection. The selection of changepoints involves multiple dependent decisions, and we address this time-dependence by adopting a non-marginal false discovery rate control. This leads to a simple decision rule that ensures more stringent control of the false discovery rate compared to approaches that do not consider dependence. The method is efficiently implemented using a Gibbs sampling algorithm, leading to a straightforward approach compared to existing methods for dependent random partition models. Additionally, we show how the proposed method can be adapted to handle multi-view clustering scenarios. Simulation studies and the analysis of a human gesture phase dataset collected through various sensing technologies show the effectiveness of the method in clustering multivariate time series and detecting changepoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Global Daily CO2 Emissions via Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20057v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High temporal resolution CO2 emission data are crucial for understanding the drivers of emission changes, however, current emission dataset is only available on a yearly basis. Here, we extended a global daily CO2 emissions dataset backwards in time to 1970 using machine learning algorithm, which was trained to predict historical daily emissions on national scales based on relationships between daily emission variations and predictors established for the period since 2019. Variation in daily CO2 emissions far exceeded the smoothed seasonal variations. For example, the range of daily CO2 emissions equivalent to 31% of the year average daily emissions in China and 46% of that in India in 2022, respectively. We identified the critical emission-climate temperature (Tc) is 16.5 degree celsius for global average (18.7 degree celsius for China, 14.9 degree celsius for U.S., and 18.4 degree celsius for Japan), in which negative correlation observed between daily CO2 emission and ambient temperature below Tc and a positive correlation above it, demonstrating increased emissions associated with higher ambient temperature. The long-term time series spanning over fifty years of global daily CO2 emissions reveals an increasing trend in emissions due to extreme temperature events, driven by the rising frequency of these occurrences. This work suggests that, due to climate change, greater efforts may be needed to reduce CO2 emissions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Models in Smart Agriculture for Soil Moisture Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18913v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in foundation models for natural language processing and computer vision has fueled innovation across various domains. Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop</p></details> |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

| **[ElastiBench: Scalable Continuous Benchmarking on Cloud FaaS Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13528v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Running microbenchmark suites often and early in the development process enables developers to identify performance issues in their application. Microbenchmark suites of complex applications can comprise hundreds of individual benchmarks and take multiple hours to evaluate meaningfully, making running those benchmarks as part of CI/CD pipelines infeasible. In this paper, we reduce the total execution time of microbenchmark suites by leveraging the massive scalability and elasticity of FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platforms. While using FaaS enables users to quickly scale up to thousands of parallel function instances to speed up microbenchmarking, the performance variation and low control over the underlying computing resources complicate reliable benchmarking. We demonstrate an architecture for executing microbenchmark suites on cloud FaaS platforms and evaluate it on code changes from an open-source time series database. Our evaluation shows that our prototype can produce reliable results (~95% of performance changes accurately detected) in a quarter of the time (<=15min vs.~4h) and at lower cost ($0.49 vs. ~$1.18) compared to cloud-based virtual machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 12th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Alzheimer's Dementia vs. Healthy subjects by studying structural disparities in fMRI Time-Series of DMN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19990v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series from different regions of interest (ROI) of default mode network (DMN) from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) can reveal significant differences between healthy and unhealthy people. Here, we propose the utility of an existing metric quantifying the lack/presence of structure in a signal called, "deviation from stochasticity" (DS) measure to characterize resting-state fMRI time series. The hypothesis is that differences in the level of structure in the time series can lead to discrimination between the subject groups. In this work, an autoencoder-based model is utilized to learn efficient representations of data by training the network to reconstruct its input data. The proposed methodology is applied on fMRI time series of 50 healthy individuals and 50 subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), obtained from publicly available ADNI database. DS measure for healthy fMRI as expected turns out to be different compared to that of AD. Peak classification accuracy of 95% was obtained using Gradient Boosting classifier, using the DS measure applied on 100 subjects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Scenario-based Analysis: A data-driven approach to support automated driving systems development and safety evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19975v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several scenario-based frameworks exist to aid in vehicle system development and safety assurance. However, there is a need for approaches that combine different types of datasets that offer varying levels of case severity, data richness, and representativeness. This study presents an integrated scenario-based analysis approach that encompasses scenario definition, fusion, parametrization, and test case generation. For this process, ten years of fatal and non-fatal national crash data from the United States are combined with over 34 million miles of naturalistic driving data. An illustrative example scenario, "turns at intersection", is chosen to demonstrate this approach. First, scenario definitions are established from both record-based and continuous time series data. Second, a frequency analysis is performed to understand how often events from the same scenario occur at different severities across datasets. Third, an analysis is performed to show the key factors relevant to the scenario and the distribution of various parameters. Finally, a method to combine both types of data into representative test case scenarios is presented. These techniques improve scenario representativeness in two major ways: first, they populate an entire spectrum of cases ranging from routine events to fatal crashes; and second, they provide context-rich, multi-year data by combining large-scale national and naturalistic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[MSegRNN:Enhanced SegRNN Model with Mamba for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10768v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the MSegRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Response Theory via Generative Score Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01029v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an approach for analyzing the responses of dynamical systems to external perturbations that combines score-based generative modeling with the Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT). The methodology enables accurate estimation of system responses, including those with non-Gaussian statistics. We numerically validate our approach using time-series data from three different stochastic partial differential equations of increasing complexity: an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with spatially correlated noise, a modified stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of the methodology over conventional methods and discuss its potential as a versatile tool for predicting the statistical behavior of complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey and Taxonomy: The Role of Data-Centric AI in Transformer-Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19784v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alongside the continuous process of improving AI performance through the development of more sophisticated models, researchers have also focused their attention to the emerging concept of data-centric AI, which emphasizes the important role of data in a systematic machine learning training process. Nonetheless, the development of models has also continued apace. One result of this progress is the development of the Transformer Architecture, which possesses a high level of capability in multiple domains such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV) and Time Series Forecasting (TSF). Its performance is, however, heavily dependent on input data preprocessing and output data evaluation, justifying a data-centric approach to future research. We argue that data-centric AI is essential for training AI models, particularly for transformer-based TSF models efficiently. However, there is a gap regarding the integration of transformer-based TSF and data-centric AI. This survey aims to pin down this gap via the extensive literature review based on the proposed taxonomy. We review the previous research works from a data-centric AI perspective and we intend to lay the foundation work for the future development of transformer-based architecture and data-centric AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiscale Representation Enhanced Temporal Flow Fusion Model for Long-Term Workload Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19697v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate workload forecasting is critical for efficient resource management in cloud computing systems, enabling effective scheduling and autoscaling. Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24), October 21--25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA</p></details> |
| **[Towards Detecting IoT Event Spoofing Attacks Using Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19662v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices have grown in popularity since they can directly interact with the real world. Home automation systems automate these interactions. IoT events are crucial to these systems' decision-making but are often unreliable. Security vulnerabilities allow attackers to impersonate events. Using statistical machine learning, IoT event fingerprints from deployed sensors have been used to detect spoofed events. Multivariate temporal data from these sensors has structural and temporal properties that statistical machine learning cannot learn. These schemes' accuracy depends on the knowledge base; the larger, the more accurate. However, the lack of huge datasets with enough samples of each IoT event in the nascent field of IoT can be a bottleneck. In this work, we deployed advanced machine learning to detect event-spoofing assaults. The temporal nature of sensor data lets us discover important patterns with fewer events. Our rigorous investigation of a publicly available real-world dataset indicates that our time-series-based solution technique learns temporal features from sensor data faster than earlier work, even with a 100- or 500-fold smaller training sample, making it a realistic IoT solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted - 49th IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Global and Local Features of Power Load Series Through Transformer and 2D-CNN: An Image-based Multi-step Forecasting Approach Incorporating Phase Space Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11553v2)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern power systems continue to evolve, accurate power load forecasting remains a critical issue in energy management. The phase space reconstruction method can effectively retain the inner chaotic property of power load from a system dynamics perspective and thus is a promising knowledge-based preprocessing method for short-term forecasting. In order to fully utilize the capability of PSR method to model the non-stationary characteristics within power load, and to solve the problem of the difficulty in applying traditional PSR prediction methods to form a general multi-step forecasting scheme, this study proposes a novel multi-step forecasting approach by delicately integrating the PSR with neural networks to establish an end-to-end learning system. Firstly, the useful features in the phase trajectory are discussed in detail. Through mathematical derivation, the equivalent characterization of the PSR and another time series preprocessing method, patch segmentation, is demonstrated for the first time. Based on this knowledge, an image-based modeling perspective is introduced. Subsequently, a novel deep learning model, namely PSR-GALIEN, is designed, in which the Transformer Encoder and 2D-CNN are employed for the extraction of the global and local patterns in the image, and a MLP-based predictor is used for the efficient correlation modeling. Then, extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the PSR-GALIEN. The results show that, compared with six state-of-the-art deep learning models, the forecasting performance of PSR-GALIEN consistently surpasses these baselines, achieving superior accuracy in both intra-day and day-ahead forecasting scenarios. At the same time, the attributions of its forecasting results can be explained through the visualization-based method, which significantly increases the interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems via Causal Discovery from Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09871v4)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online unsupervised detection of anomalies is crucial to guarantee the correct operation of cyber-physical systems and the safety of humans interacting with them. State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of >10 different anomalies.

| **[Appformer: A Novel Framework for Mobile App Usage Prediction Leveraging Progressive Multi-Modal Data Fusion and Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19414v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents Appformer, a novel mobile application prediction framework inspired by the efficiency of Transformer-like architectures in processing sequential data through self-attention mechanisms. Combining a Multi-Modal Data Progressive Fusion Module with a sophisticated Feature Extraction Module, Appformer leverages the synergies of multi-modal data fusion and data mining techniques while maintaining user privacy. The framework employs Points of Interest (POIs) associated with base stations, optimizing them through comprehensive comparative experiments to identify the most effective clustering method. These refined inputs are seamlessly integrated into the initial phases of cross-modal data fusion, where temporal units are encoded via word embeddings and subsequently merged in later stages. The Feature Extraction Module, employing Transformer-like architectures specialized for time series analysis, adeptly distils comprehensive features. It meticulously fine-tunes the outputs from the fusion module, facilitating the extraction of high-calibre, multi-modal features, thus guaranteeing a robust and efficient extraction process. Extensive experimental validation confirms Appformer's effectiveness, attaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in mobile app usage prediction, thereby signifying a notable progression in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise and Efficient Orbit Prediction in LEO with Machine Learning using Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11026v2)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing volume of space objects in Earth's orbit presents a significant challenge for Space Situational Awareness (SSA). And in particular, accurate orbit prediction is crucial to anticipate the position and velocity of space objects, for collision avoidance and space debris mitigation. When performing Orbit Prediction (OP), it is necessary to consider the impact of non-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of spacecraft and space debris alike. Conventional propagator methods like the SGP4 inadequately account for these forces, while numerical propagators are able to model the forces at a high computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose an orbit prediction algorithm utilizing machine learning. This algorithm forecasts state vectors on a spacecraft using past positions and environmental variables like atmospheric density from external sources. The orbital data used in the paper is gathered from precision ephemeris data from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), for the period of almost a year. We show how the use of machine learning and time-series techniques can produce low positioning errors at a very low computational cost, thus significantly improving SSA capabilities by providing faster and reliable orbit determination for an ever increasing number of space objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at IEEE WCCI CEC Congress 2024</p></details> |

In essence, the net vegetation flux is the difference of the uptake of CO$_2$ via photosynthesis and the release of CO$_2$ via respiration, while the system is driven by periodic processes at different time-scales. The complexity of the underlying dynamics poses challenges to classical decomposition methods focused on maximizing data variance, such as singular spectrum analysis. Here, we explore whether nonlinear data-driven methods can better separate periodic patterns and their harmonics from noise and stochastic variability. We find that Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA) outperforms the linear method and detects multiple relevant harmonics. However, these harmonics are not detected in the presence of substantial measurement irregularities. In summary, the NLSA approach can be used to both extract the seasonal cycle more accurately than linear methods, but likewise detect irregular signals resulting from irregular land-atmosphere interactions or measurement failures. Improving the detection capabilities of time-series decomposition is essential for improving land-atmosphere interactions models that should operate accurately on any time scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, research article</p></details> |

Our central proposition is an enhanced inference technique and long-range dependency method for SNLDS. The cornerstone of our approach is the fusion of S4 and SNLDS, leveraging the strengths of both models to effectively address the intricacies of long-range dependencies in switching time series. Through rigorous testing, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology adeptly segments and reproduces long-range dependencies in both the 1-D Lorenz dataset and the 2-D bouncing ball dataset. Notably, our integrated approach outperforms the standalone SNLDS in these tasks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[On Consistency of Signature Using Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10413v3)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signatures are iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time processes, and their universal nonlinearity linearizes the problem of feature selection in time series data analysis. This paper studies the consistency of signature using Lasso regression, both theoretically and numerically. We establish conditions under which the Lasso regression is consistent both asymptotically and in finite sample. Furthermore, we show that the Lasso regression is more consistent with the It\^o signature for time series and processes that are closer to the Brownian motion and with weaker inter-dimensional correlations, while it is more consistent with the Stratonovich signature for mean-reverting time series and processes. We demonstrate that signature can be applied to learn nonlinear functions and option prices with high accuracy, and the performance depends on properties of the underlying process and the choice of the signature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Automotive Supply Chain Shortfalls with Heterogeneous Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16739v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metadata-enhanced contrastive learning from retinal optical coherence tomography images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02529v3)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has potential to automate screening, monitoring and grading of disease in medical images. Pretraining with contrastive learning enables models to extract robust and generalisable features from natural image datasets, facilitating label-efficient downstream image analysis. However, the direct application of conventional contrastive methods to medical datasets introduces two domain-specific issues. Firstly, several image transformations which have been shown to be crucial for effective contrastive learning do not translate from the natural image to the medical image domain. Secondly, the assumption made by conventional methods, that any two images are dissimilar, is systematically misleading in medical datasets depicting the same anatomy and disease. This is exacerbated in longitudinal image datasets that repeatedly image the same patient cohort to monitor their disease progression over time. In this paper we tackle these issues by extending conventional contrastive frameworks with a novel metadata-enhanced strategy. Our approach employs widely available patient metadata to approximate the true set of inter-image contrastive relationships. To this end we employ records for patient identity, eye position (i.e. left or right) and time series information. In experiments using two large longitudinal datasets containing 170,427 retinal OCT images of 7,912 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we evaluate the utility of using metadata to incorporate the temporal dynamics of disease progression into pretraining. Our metadata-enhanced approach outperforms both standard contrastive methods and a retinal image foundation model in five out of six image-level downstream tasks related to AMD. Due to its modularity, our method can be quickly and cost-effectively tested to establish the potential benefits of including available metadata in contrastive pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep learning for predicting the occurrence of tipping points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18693v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tipping points occur in many real-world systems, at which the system shifts suddenly from one state to another. The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning of Asset Embeddings from Financial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18645v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for extracting valuable latent features from complex, high-dimensional data. In financial domains, learning informative representations for assets can be used for tasks like sector classification, and risk management. However, the complex and stochastic nature of financial markets poses unique challenges. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to generate asset embeddings from financial time series data. Our approach leverages the similarity of asset returns over many subwindows to generate informative positive and negative samples, using a statistical sampling strategy based on hypothesis testing to address the noisy nature of financial data. We explore various contrastive loss functions that capture the relationships between assets in different ways to learn a discriminative representation space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned asset embeddings on benchmark industry classification and portfolio optimization tasks. In each case our novel approaches significantly outperform existing baselines highlighting the potential for contrastive learning to capture meaningful and actionable relationships in financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) demonstrate good performance on many Temporal-correlation Forecasting Problem. However, when applied to tasks lacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and robustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by memory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize Temporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and pre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation pre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of nodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And memory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through multiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets CSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP in downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the capability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Recurrent Neural Networks and Deep Learning Frameworks on Real-time Lightweight Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18439v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection has become increasingly crucial in cybersecurity and many other domains. Its ability to adapt to unforeseen pattern changes and swiftly identify anomalies enables prompt responses and critical decision-making. While several such anomaly detection approaches have been introduced in recent years, they primarily utilize a single type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and have been implemented in only one deep learning framework. It is unclear how the use of different types of RNNs available in various deep learning frameworks affects the performance of these anomaly detection approaches due to the absence of comprehensive evaluations. Arbitrarily choosing a RNN variant and a deep learning framework to implement an anomaly detection approach may not reflect its true performance and could potentially mislead users into favoring one approach over another. In this paper, we aim to study the influence of various types of RNNs available in popular deep learning frameworks on real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection. We reviewed several state-of-the-art approaches and implemented a representative anomaly detection approach using well-known RNN variants supported by three widely recognized deep learning frameworks. A comprehensive evaluation is then conducted to analyze the performance of each implementation across real-world, open-source time series datasets. The evaluation results provide valuable guidance for selecting the appropriate RNN variant and deep learning framework for real-time, lightweight time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, The 26th International Conference on Information and Communications Security, 26-28 August, 2024, Mytilene, Lesvos, Greece (ICICS2024)</p></details> |

We train a specific class of deep auto-encoders that learn to reproduce the input waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck, and then use a simple triggering algorithm at the bottleneck to label waveforms as noise or signal. Our approach is motivated by the intuition that efficient compression of data should represent signals differently from noise, and is facilitated by a time-axis-preserving approach to auto-encoding and intuitively-motivated choices on the architecture and triggering. We demonstrate that the detection performance of the unsupervised approach is comparable to, and in some cases better than, some of the state-of-the-art supervised methods. Moreover, it has strong \emph{cross-dataset generalization}. By experimenting with various modifications, we demonstrate that the detection performance is insensitive to various technical choices made in the algorithm. Our approach has the potential to be useful for other signal detection problems with time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-TGRS</p></details> |

The framework identifies and characterizes inter-subject similarities and differences between two pre-determined groups by considering a combination of group spatial information and individual temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it enables the identification of intra-subject similarities and differences over time by employing different model configurations for each subject. Methodologically, the framework combines a novel principal angle-based rank selection algorithm and a non-iterative integrative analysis framework. Inspired by simultaneous component analysis, this approach also reconstructs identifiable latent factor series with flexible covariance structures. The performance of the GRIDY models is evaluated through simulations conducted under various scenarios. An application is also presented to compare resting-state functional MRI data collected from multiple subjects in autism spectrum disorder and control groups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can time series forecasting be automated? A benchmark and analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16445v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, time series forecasting plays a pivotal role across various domains such as finance, healthcare, and weather. However, the task of selecting the most suitable forecasting method for a given dataset is a complex task due to the diversity of data patterns and characteristics. This research aims to address this challenge by proposing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and ranking time series forecasting methods across a wide range of datasets. This study investigates the comparative performance of many methods from two prominent time series forecasting frameworks, AutoGluon-Timeseries, and sktime to shed light on their applicability in different real-world scenarios. This research contributes to the field of time series forecasting by providing a robust benchmarking methodology and facilitating informed decision-making when choosing forecasting methods for achieving optimal prediction.</p></details> |  |

Our research presents an analysis of quantum randomized smoothing, how data encoding and perturbation modeling approaches can be matched to achieve meaningful robustness certificates. By utilizing an innovative approach integrating Grover's algorithm, a quadratic sampling advantage over classical randomized smoothing is achieved. This strategy necessitates a basis state encoding, thus restricting the space of meaningful perturbations. We show how constrained $k$-distant Hamming weight perturbations are a suitable noise distribution here, and elucidate how they can be constructed on a quantum computer. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated on a time series classification task employing a Bag-of-Words pre-processing solution. The advantage of quadratic sample reduction is recovered especially in the regime with large number of samples. This may allow quantum computers to efficiently scale randomized smoothing to more complex tasks beyond the reach of classical methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)</p></details> |

MBPS combines a set of predictive models and partitions the multiple time series into clusters based on their contribution to predicting the outcome. In this way, MBPS leverages the shared information within each cluster and is suitable for predicting COVID-19 inpatients since the data exhibit similar dynamics over multiple areas. Also, MBPS avoids using a multivariate count model, which is generally cumbersome to develop and implement. Our Japanese and Korean data analyses demonstrate that the proposed MBPS methodology has improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Bayesian inference for time series via divide-and-conquer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11043v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian computational algorithms tend to scale poorly as data size increases. This has motivated divide-and-conquer-based approaches for scalable inference. These divide the data into subsets, perform inference for each subset in parallel, and then combine these inferences. While appealing theoretical properties and practical performance have been demonstrated for independent observations, scalable inference for dependent data remains challenging. In this work, we study the problem of Bayesian inference from very long time series. The literature in this area focuses mainly on approximate approaches that usually lack rigorous theoretical guarantees and may provide arbitrarily poor accuracy in practice. We propose a simple and scalable divide-and-conquer method, and provide accuracy guarantees. Numerical simulations and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo for hidden Markov models with rare latent states](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13431v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for hidden Markov models often rely on the forward-backward sampler. This makes them computationally slow as the length of the time series increases, motivating the development of sub-sampling-based approaches. These approximate the full posterior by using small random subsequences of the data at each MCMC iteration within stochastic gradient MCMC. In the presence of imbalanced data resulting from rare latent states, subsequences often exclude rare latent state data, leading to inaccurate inference and prediction/detection of rare events. We propose a targeted sub-sampling (TASS) approach that over-samples observations corresponding to rare latent states when calculating the stochastic gradient of parameters associated with them. TASS uses an initial clustering of the data to construct subsequence weights that reduce the variance in gradient estimation. This leads to improved sampling efficiency, in particular in settings where the rare latent states correspond to extreme observations. We demonstrate substantial gains in predictive and inferential accuracy on real and synthetic examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAM: Towards A Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17880v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is challenging to scale time series forecasting models such that they forecast accurately for multiple distinct domains and datasets, all with potentially different underlying collection procedures (e.g., sample resolution), patterns (e.g., periodicity), and prediction requirements (e.g., reconstruction vs. forecasting). We call this general task universal forecasting. Existing methods usually assume that input data is regularly sampled, and they forecast to pre-determined horizons, resulting in failure to generalise outside of the scope of their training. We propose the DAM - a neural model that takes randomly sampled histories and outputs an adjustable basis composition as a continuous function of time for forecasting to non-fixed horizons. It involves three key components: (1) a flexible approach for using randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution, that enables an efficient global perspective of the underlying temporal dynamics while retaining focus on the recent history; (2) a transformer backbone that is trained on these actively sampled histories to produce, as representational output, (3) the basis coefficients of a continuous function of time. We show that a single univariate DAM, trained on 25 time series datasets, either outperformed or closely matched existing SoTA models at multivariate long-term forecasting across 18 datasets, including 8 held-out for zero-shot transfer, even though these models were trained to specialise for each dataset-horizon combination. This single DAM excels at zero-shot transfer and very-long-term forecasting, performs well at imputation, is interpretable via basis function composition and attention, can be tuned for different inference-cost requirements, is robust to missing and irregularly sampled data {by design}.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG-SSM: Leveraging State-Space Model for Dementia Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17801v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs) have garnered attention for effectively processing long data sequences, reducing the need to segment time series into shorter intervals for model training and inference. Traditionally, SSMs capture only the temporal dynamics of time series data, omitting the equally critical spectral features. This study introduces EEG-SSM, a novel state-space model-based approach for dementia classification using EEG data. Our model features two primary innovations: EEG-SSM temporal and EEG-SSM spectral components. The temporal component is designed to efficiently process EEG sequences of varying lengths, while the spectral component enhances the model by integrating frequency-domain information from EEG signals. The synergy of these components allows EEG-SSM to adeptly manage the complexities of multivariate EEG data, significantly improving accuracy and stability across different temporal resolutions. Demonstrating a remarkable 91.0 percent accuracy in classifying Healthy Control (HC), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) groups, EEG-SSM outperforms existing models on the same dataset. The development of EEG-SSM represents an improvement in the use of state-space models for screening dementia, offering more precise and cost-effective tools for clinical neuroscience.</p></details> |  |

Faults or Anomalies are observed in these time-series data owing to faults observed with respect to metric name, resources region, dimensions, and its dimension value associated with the data.

The number of anomalies reported should be highly significant and in a limited number, e.g., 5-20 anomalies reported per hour. The reported anomalies will have significant user perception and high reconstruction error in any time-series forecasting model.

Investigation of deep learning for HOIs, thus, has become a valuable agenda for the data mining and machine learning communities. As networks of HOIs are expressed mathematically as hypergraphs, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for representation learning on hypergraphs. Given the emerging trend, we present the first survey dedicated to HNNs, with an in-depth and step-by-step guide. Broadly, the present survey overviews HNN architectures, training strategies, and applications. First, we break existing HNNs down into four design components: (i) input features, (ii) input structures, (iii) message-passing schemes, and (iv) training strategies. Second, we examine how HNNs address and learn HOIs with each of their components. Third, we overview the recent applications of HNNs in recommendation, bioinformatics and medical science, time series analysis, and computer vision.

However, forecasting the structure of a graph at future time steps incorporating unseen, new nodes and edges has not gained much attention. In this paper, we present such an approach. Using a time series of graphs, we forecast graphs at future time steps. We use time series forecasting methods to predict the node degree at future time points and combine these forecasts with flux balance analysis -- a linear programming method used in biochemistry -- to obtain the structure of future graphs. We evaluate this approach using synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its utility and applicability.</p></details> |  |

The high frequency of measurements enables granular and dynamic evaluation of treatment effect, revealing their persistence and accumulation over time. Existing methods predominantly focus on the contemporaneous effect, temporal-average, or population-average effects, assuming stationarity or invariance of treatment effects over time, which are inadequate both conceptually and statistically to capture dynamic treatment effects in personalized mobile health data. We here propose new causal estimands for multivariate time series in N-of-1 studies. These estimands summarize how time-varying exposures impact outcomes in both short- and long-term. We propose identifiability assumptions and a g-formula estimator that accounts for exposure-outcome and outcome-covariate feedback. The g-formula employs a state space model framework innovatively to accommodate time-varying behavior of treatment effects in non-stationary time series. We apply the proposed method to a multi-year smartphone observational study of bipolar patients and estimate the dynamic effect of phone-based communication on mood of patients with bipolar disorder in an N-of-1 setting. Our approach reveals substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects over time and across individuals. A simulation-based strategy is also proposed for the development of a short-term, dynamic, and personalized treatment recommendation based on patient's past information, in combination with a novel positivity diagnostics plot, validating proper causal inference in time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[POCKET: Pruning Random Convolution Kernels for Time Series Classification from a Feature Selection Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08499v4)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, two competitive time series classification models, namely, ROCKET and MINIROCKET, have garnered considerable attention due to their low training cost and high accuracy. However, they rely on a large number of random 1-D convolutional kernels to comprehensively capture features, which is incompatible with resource-constrained devices. Despite the development of heuristic algorithms designed to recognize and prune redundant kernels, the inherent time-consuming nature of evolutionary algorithms hinders efficient evaluation. To efficiently prune models, this paper eliminates feature groups contributing minimally to the classifier, thereby discarding the associated random kernels without direct evaluation. To this end, we incorporate both group-level ($l_{2,1}$-norm) and element-level ($l_2$-norm) regularizations to the classifier, formulating the pruning challenge as a group elastic net classification problem. An ADMM-based algorithm is initially introduced to solve the problem, but it is computationally intensive. Building on the ADMM-based algorithm, we then propose our core algorithm, POCKET, which significantly speeds up the process by dividing the task into two sequential stages. In Stage 1, POCKET utilizes dynamically varying penalties to efficiently achieve group sparsity within the classifier, removing features associated with zero weights and their corresponding kernels. In Stage 2, the remaining kernels and features are used to refit a $l_2$-regularized classifier for enhanced performance. Experimental results on diverse time series datasets show that POCKET prunes up to 60% of kernels without a significant reduction in accuracy and performs 11$\times$ faster than its counterparts.

We develop a data-driven approach to address this challenge by introducing a null-signal template (NST). The NST is created by carefully randomizing the period of each cycle in the periodogram template, rendering it non-periodic. It has the same frequentist properties as a periodic signal template regardless of the noise probability distribution, and we show with simulations that the distribution of false positives is the same as with the original periodic template, regardless of the underlying data. Thus, performing a periodicity search with the NST acts as an effective simulation of the null (no-signal) hypothesis, without having to simulate the noise properties of the data. We apply the NST method to the supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) search in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), where Charisi et al. had previously proposed 33 high signal to (white) noise candidates utilizing simulations to quantify their significance. Our approach reveals that these simulations do not capture the complexity of the real data. There are no statistically significant periodic signal detections above the non-periodic background. To improve the search sensitivity we introduce a Gaussian quadrature based algorithm for the Bayes Factor with correlated noise as a test statistic, in contrast to the standard signal to white noise. We show with simulations that this improves sensitivity to true signals by more than an order of magnitude. However, using the Bayes Factor approach also results in no statistically significant detections in the PTF data.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

Two representative channel strategies are closely associated with model expressivity and robustness, including channel independence (CI) and channel dependence (CD). The former adopts individual channel treatment and has been shown to be more robust to distribution shifts, but lacks sufficient capacity to model meaningful channel interactions. The latter is more expressive for representing complex cross-channel dependencies, but is prone to overfitting. To balance the two strategies, we present a channel-aware low-rank adaptation method to condition CD models on identity-aware individual components. As a plug-in solution, it is adaptable for a wide range of backbone architectures. Extensive experiments show that it can consistently and significantly improve the performance of both CI and CD models with demonstrated efficiency and flexibility.

This study introduces a novel methodology that integrates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) with advanced intrinsic and post-hoc interpretability techniques for detecting the onset of MDR in patients across time. Within interpretability methods, we propose Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches to handle irregular Multivariate Time Series (MTS), introducing Irregular Time Shapley Additive Explanations (IT-SHAP), a modification of Shapley Additive Explanations designed for irregular MTS with Recurrent Neural Networks focused on temporal outputs. Our methodology aims to identify specific risk factors associated with MDR in ICU patients. GRU with Hadamard's attention demonstrated high initial specificity and increasing sensitivity over time, correlating with increased nosocomial infection risks during prolonged ICU stays. XAI analysis, enhanced by Hadamard attention and IT-SHAP, identified critical factors such as previous non-resistant cultures, specific antibiotic usage patterns, and hospital environment dynamics. These insights suggest that early detection of at-risk patients can inform interventions such as preventive isolation and customized treatments, significantly improving clinical outcomes. The proposed GRU model for temporal classification achieved an average Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 78.27 +- 1.26 over time, indicating strong predictive performance. In summary, this study highlights the clinical utility of our methodology, which combines predictive accuracy with interpretability, thereby facilitating more effective healthcare interventions by professionals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning Is Not Optimal for Quasiperiodic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17073v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advancements in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for time series analysis, a noticeable gap persists between the anticipated achievements and actual performance. While these methods have demonstrated formidable generalization capabilities with minimal labels in various domains, their effectiveness in distinguishing between different classes based on a limited number of annotated records is notably lacking. Our hypothesis attributes this bottleneck to the prevalent use of Contrastive Learning, a shared training objective in previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. By mandating distinctiveness between representations for negative pairs drawn from separate records, this approach compels the model to encode unique record-based patterns but simultaneously neglects changes occurring across the entire record. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Distilled Embedding for Almost-Periodic Time Series (DEAPS) in this paper, offering a non-contrastive method tailored for quasiperiodic time series, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) data. By avoiding the use of negative pairs, we not only mitigate the model's blindness to temporal changes but also enable the integration of a "Gradual Loss (Lgra)" function. This function guides the model to effectively capture dynamic patterns evolving throughout the record. The outcomes are promising, as DEAPS demonstrates a notable improvement of +10% over existing SOTA methods when just a few annotated records are presented to fit a Machine Learning (ML) model based on the learned representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Schrödinger Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14504v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

We consider neural networks with piecewise linear activations and depths ranging from 2 to an arbitrary but finite number of layers. We first show that two-layer networks with piecewise linear activations are equivalent to Lasso models using a discrete dictionary of ramp functions, with breakpoints corresponding to the training data points. In certain general architectures with absolute value or ReLU activations, a third layer surprisingly creates features that reflect the training data about themselves. Additional layers progressively generate reflections of these reflections. The Lasso representation provides valuable insights into the analysis of globally optimal networks, elucidating their solution landscapes and enabling closed-form solutions in certain special cases. Numerical results show that reflections also occur when optimizing standard deep networks using standard non-convex optimizers. Additionally, we demonstrate our theory with autoregressive time series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19888v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeInf: Time Series Data Contribution via Influence Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15247v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the contribution of individual data points to a model's prediction is critical for interpreting model predictions and improving model performance. Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and texts; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains unexplored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. TimeInf uses influence functions to attribute model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TimeInf outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying harmful anomalies and helpful time points for forecasting. Additionally, TimeInf offers intuitive and interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to easily distinguish diverse anomaly patterns through visualizations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contribution for the Causal Inference for Time Series Data Workshop at the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (CI4TS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Interval Forecasts for Gas Prices in the Face of Structural Breaks -- Statistical Models vs. Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16723v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable gas price forecasts are an essential information for gas and energy traders, for risk managers and also economists. However, ahead of the war in Ukraine Europe began to suffer from substantially increased and volatile gas prices which culminated in the aftermath of the North Stream 1 explosion. This shock changed both trend and volatility structure of the prices and has considerable effects on forecasting models. In this study we investigate whether modern machine learning methods such as neural networks are more resilient against such changes than statistical models such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with conditional heteroskedasticity, or copula-based time series models. Thereby the focus lies on interval forecasting and applying respective evaluation measures. As data, the Front Month prices from the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, currently the predominant European exchange, are used. We see that, during the shock period, most models underestimate the variance while overestimating the variance in the after-shock period. Furthermore, we recognize that, during the shock, the simpler models, i.e. an ARMA model with conditional heteroskedasticity and the multilayer perceptron (a neural network), perform best with regards to prediction interval coverage. Interestingly, the widely-used long-short term neural network is outperformed by its competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Autoregressive Online Change-Point Detection with Time-Varying Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16376v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change points in real-world systems mark significant regime shifts in system dynamics, possibly triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors. These points define regimes for the time evolution of the system and are crucial for understanding transitions in financial, economic, social, environmental, and technological contexts. Building upon the Bayesian approach introduced in \cite{c:07}, we devise a new method for online change point detection in the mean of a univariate time series, which is well suited for real-time applications and is able to handle the general temporal patterns displayed by data in many empirical contexts. We first describe time series as an autoregressive process of an arbitrary order. Second, the variance and correlation of the data are allowed to vary within each regime driven by a scoring rule that updates the value of the parameters for a better fit of the observations. Finally, a change point is detected in a probabilistic framework via the posterior distribution of the current regime length. By modeling temporal dependencies and time-varying parameters, the proposed approach enhances both the estimate accuracy and the forecasting power. Empirical validations using various datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing memory and dynamic patterns, offering deeper insights into the non-stationary dynamics of real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[The dynamics of the Reddit collective action leading to the GameStop short squeeze](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14999v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In early 2021, the stock prices of GameStop, AMC, Nokia, and BlackBerry experienced dramatic increases, triggered by short squeeze operations that have been largely attributed to Reddit's retail investors. These events showcased, for the first time, the potential of online social networks to catalyze financial collective action. How, when and to what extent Reddit users played a role in driving up these prices, however, remains unclear. We address these questions by statistical analysis of time series with high temporal resolution, about social activity on Reddit and Twitter as well as stock trading volumes. We find that increasing Reddit discussions anticipated high trading volume before the GameStop short squeeze, with their predictive power being particularly strong on hourly time scales. This effect emerged abruptly a few weeks before the event, but waned once the community of investors gained widespread visibility through Twitter. Meanwhile, the collective investment of the Reddit community, quantified through each user's financial position on GameStop, closely mirrored the market capitalization of the stock. These evidences suggest a coordinated action by Reddit users in developing a shared financial strategy through social media. Towards the end of January, users talking about GameStop contributed to raise the popularity of BlackBerry, AMC and Nokia, which emerged as the most popular stocks as the community gained global recognition. Overall, our results shed light on the dynamics behind the first large-scale financial collective action driven by social media users.</p></details> |  |

In contemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature extraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these methods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate generating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series nuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit multi-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this challenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method substantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a significant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, IEEE Machine Learning and Signal processing 2024</p></details> |
| **[Generalized functional dynamic principal component analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16024v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore dimension reduction for time series of functional data within both stationary and non-stationary frameworks. We introduce a functional framework of generalized dynamic principal component analysis (GDPCA). The concept of GDPCA aims for better adaptation to possible nonstationary features of the series. We define the functional generalized dynamic principal component (GDPC) as static factor time series in a functional dynamic factor model and obtain the multivariate GDPC from a truncation of the functional dynamic factor model. GDFPCA uses a minimum squared error criterion to evaluate the reconstruction of the original functional time series. The computation of GDPC involves a two-step estimation of the coefficient vector of the loading curves in a basis expansion. We provide a proof of the consistency of the reconstruction of the original functional time series with GDPC converging in mean square to the original functional time series. Monte Carlo simulation studies indicate that the proposed GDFPCA is comparable to dynamic functional principal component analysis (DFPCA) when the data generating process is stationary, and outperforms DFPCA and FPCA when the data generating process is non-stationary. The results of applications to real data reaffirm the findings in simulation studies.</p></details> |  |

While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from the past five years, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this paper, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI's application in the finance industry, this paper provides a comprehensive view of XAI's current role in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most appropriate XAI approach for future applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, This is the author's version of the work.

| **[Dynamic Structural Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01161v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a specific type of SCM, called a Dynamic Structural Causal Model (DSCM), whose endogenous variables represent functions of time, which is possibly cyclic and allows for latent confounding. As a motivating use-case, we show that certain systems of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) can be appropriately represented with DSCMs. An immediate consequence of this construction is a graphical Markov property for systems of SDEs. We define a time-splitting operation, allowing us to analyse the concept of local independence (a notion of continuous-time Granger (non-)causality). We also define a subsampling operation, which returns a discrete-time DSCM, and which can be used for mathematical analysis of subsampled time-series. We give suggestions how DSCMs can be used for identification of the causal effect of time-dependent interventions, and how existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms can be applied to time-series data.</p></details> |  |

This is shown to be equivalent to a generalized Tikhonov regularization, providing a rational justification for the choice of the residual and regularization terms, respectively, from the negative logarithms of the likelihood and prior distributions. In addition to the estimation of model coefficients, the Bayesian interpretation gives access to the full apparatus for Bayesian inference, including the ranking of models, the quantification of model uncertainties and the estimation of unknown (nuisance) hyperparameters. Two Bayesian algorithms, joint maximum \textit{a~posteriori} (JMAP) and variational Bayesian approximation (VBA), are compared to the {LASSO, ridge regression and SINDy algorithms for sparse} regression, by application to several dynamical systems with added {Gaussian or Laplace} noise. For multivariate Gaussian likelihood and prior distributions, the Bayesian formulation gives Gaussian posterior and evidence distributions, in which the numerator terms can be expressed in terms of the Mahalanobis distance or ``Gaussian norm'' $||\vec{y}-\hat{\vec{y}}||^2_{M^{-1}} = (\vec{y}-\hat{\vec{y}})^\top {M^{-1}} (\vec{y}-\hat{\vec{y}})$, where $\vec{y}$ is a vector variable, $\hat{\vec{y}}$ is its estimator and $M$ is the covariance matrix.

When examining a time series, the reference distribution may evolve over time. The anomaly detector must therefore be able to adapt to such changes. In the online context, it is particularly difficult to adapt to abrupt and unpredictable changes. Our solution to this problem is based on the detection of breakpoints in order to adapt in real time to the new reference behavior of the series and to increase the accuracy of the anomaly detection. This solution also provides a control of the False Discovery Rate by extending methods developed for stationary series.</p></details> | 54 pages, 9 figures |

Adversarial Data Augmentation (ADA) is a commonly used approach that enhances model adaptability by incorporating synthetic samples, designed to simulate potential unseen samples. While ADA effectively addresses amplitude-related distribution shifts, it falls short in managing temporal shifts, which are essential for time series data. To address this limitation, we propose the Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for time teries Data (TADA), which incorporates a time warping technique specifically targeting temporal shifts. Recognizing the challenge of non-differentiability in traditional time warping, we make it differentiable by leveraging phase shifts in the frequency domain. Our evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that TADA significantly outperforms existing ADA variants, enhancing model performance across time series datasets with varied distributions.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Outbreaks that are not detected and managed early can increase mortality and morbidity and incur costs from activities responding to these events. The number of measles cases in the Province of North Cotabato, Philippines, was used in this study. Weekly reported cases of measles from January 2016 to December 2021 were provided by the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit of the North Cotabato Provincial Health Office. Several integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) time series models were used to explore the possibility of detecting and identifying measles outbreaks in the province along with the classical ARIMA model. These models were evaluated based on goodness of fit, measles outbreak detection accuracy, and timeliness. The results of this study confirmed that INAR models have the conceptual advantage over ARIMA since the latter produces non-integer forecasts, which are not realistic for count data such as measles cases. Among the INAR models, the ZINGINAR (1) model was recommended for having a good model fit and timely and accurate detection of outbreaks. Furthermore, policymakers and decision-makers from relevant government agencies can use the ZINGINAR (1) model to improve disease surveillance and implement preventive measures against contagious diseases beforehand.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of deep learning models for Australian climate extremes: prediction of streamflow and floods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15882v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, climate extremes such as floods have created significant environmental and economic hazards for Australia, causing damage to the environment and economy and losses of human and animal lives. An efficient method of forecasting floods is crucial to limit this damage. Techniques for flood prediction are currently based on hydrological, and hydrodynamic (physically-based) numerical models. Machine learning methods that include deep learning offer certain advantages over conventional physically based approaches, including flexibility and accuracy. Deep learning methods have been promising for predicting small to medium-sized climate extreme events over a short time horizon; however, large flooding events present a critical challenge. We present an ensemble-based machine learning approach that addresses large-scale extreme flooding challenges using a switching mechanism motivated by extreme-value theory for long-short-term-memory (LSTM) deep learning models. We use a multivariate and multi-step time-series prediction approach to predict streamflow for multiple days ahead in the major catchments of Australia. The ensemble framework also employs static information to enrich the time-series information, allowing for regional modelling across catchments. Our results demonstrate enhanced prediction of streamflow extremes, with notable efficacy for large flooding scenarios in the selected Australian catchments. Through comparative analysis, our methodology underscores the potential for deep learning models to revolutionise flood forecasting across diverse regions.</p></details> |  |

An integrated strategy is proposed, leveraging the strengths of convolutional and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. This approach is aimed at effectively extracting temporal data from energy datasets to improve the precision of microgrid behavior forecasts. Additionally, an attention layer is employed to underscore significant features within the time-series data, optimizing the forecasting process. The framework is anchored by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is tasked with comprehensive load forecasting and the identification of abnormal grid behaviors. Our methodology underwent rigorous evaluation using the Micro-grid Tariff Assessment Tool dataset, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (r2-score) serving as the primary metrics. The approach demonstrated exemplary performance, evidenced by a MAE of 0.39, RMSE of 0.28, and an r2-score of 98.89\% in load forecasting, along with near-perfect zero state prediction accuracy (approximately 99.9\%).

While popular Transformer-based predictive models can perform well, their quadratic computational complexity results in inefficiency and high overhead. The recently emerged Mamba, a selective state space model, has shown promising results in many fields due to its strong temporal feature extraction capabilities and linear computational complexity. However, due to the unilateral nature of Mamba, channel-independent predictive models based on Mamba cannot attend to the relationships among all variables in the manner of Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we combine fast-attention with Mamba to introduce a novel framework named FMamba for MTSF. Technically, we first extract the temporal features of the input variables through an embedding layer, then compute the dependencies among input variables via the fast-attention module. Subsequently, we use Mamba to selectively deal with the input features and further extract the temporal dependencies of the variables through the multi-layer perceptron block (MLP-block). Finally, FMamba obtains the predictive results through the projector, a linear layer. Experimental results on eight public datasets demonstrate that FMamba can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, we have observed the phenomenon of inter-class similarity and intra-class inconsistency in the datasets from the UCR archive and further analyzed how this phenomenon adversely affects the "FC+SoftMax" paradigm. To address the issue, we introduce ECR, which, for the first time to our knowledge, applies deep learning-based retrieval algorithm to the TSC problem and integrates classification and retrieval models. Experimental results on 112 UCR datasets demonstrate that ECR is state-of-the-art(sota) compared to existing deep learning-based methods. Furthermore, we have developed a more precise classifier, ECRTime, which is an ensemble of ECR. ECRTime surpasses the currently most accurate deep learning classifier, InceptionTime, in terms of accuracy, achieving this with reduced training time and comparable scalability.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, casualty ILS are appealing to insurers as an efficient capital managment tool. However, securitizing casualty insurance risk is non-trivial, as it requires forecasting loss ratios for pools of insurance policies that have not yet been written, in addition to estimating how the underlying losses will develop over time within future accident years. In this paper, we lay out a Bayesian workflow that tackles these complexities by using: (1) theoretically informed time-series and state-space models to capture how loss ratios develop and change over time; (2) historic industry data to inform prior distributions of models fit to individual programs; (3) stacking to combine loss ratio predictions from candidate models, and (4) both prior predictive simulations and simulation-based calibration to aid model specification. Using historic Schedule P filings, we then show how our proposed Bayesian workflow can be used to assess and compare models across a variety of key model performance metrics evaluated on future accident year losses.</p></details> | 31 pages, 7 figures |

We consider IV regression in time series models, such as vector auto-regressive (VAR) processes. Direct applications of i.i.d. techniques are generally inconsistent as they do not correctly adjust for dependencies in the past. In this paper, we outline the difficulties that arise due to time structure and propose methodology for constructing identifying equations that can be used for consistent parametric estimation of causal effects in time series data. One method uses extra nuisance covariates to obtain identifiability (an idea that can be of interest even in the i.i.d. case). We further propose a graph marginalization framework that allows us to apply nuisance IV and other IV methods in a principled way to time series. Our methods make use of a version of the global Markov property, which we prove holds for VAR(p) processes. For VAR(1) processes, we prove identifiability conditions that relate to Jordan forms and are different from the well-known rank conditions in the i.i.d. case (they do not require as many instruments as covariates, for example). We provide methods, prove their consistency, and show how the inferred causal effect can be used for distribution generalization. Simulation experiments corroborate our theoretical results. We provide ready-to-use Python code.</p></details> |  |

Exploiting the information enrichment principle devised by Reinschl\"ussel and Arnold arXiv:2402.16580 [stat.ME] to improve the Lasso-based selection of ADF models, we propose a composite statistic and analyse its asymptotic distribution and local power function. Monte Carlo evidence shows that the combined test dominates the comparable post-selection inference methods of Tibshirani et al. [JASA, 2016, 514, 600-620] and may surpass the power of established unit root tests against local alternatives.

The enhanced weight builds on a statistic that exploits distinct orders in probability of the OLS estimator in time series regressions when the degree of integration differs. We provide theoretical results on the benefit of our approach for detecting stationarity when a tuning criterion selects the $\ell_1$ penalty parameter. Monte Carlo evidence shows that our proposal is superior to using OLS-based weights, as suggested by Kock [Econom. Theory, 32, 2016, 243-259]. We apply the modified estimator to model selection for German inflation rates after the introduction of the Euro.

Our approach is based on a general construction of infinite memory models, called chains with complete connections. The two main ingredients involved in our generic construction are a parametric family of probability distributions on the state space and a map from the state space to the parameter space. Our framework encompasses Markovian models, observation-driven models and more general infinite memory models. Simple conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of a stationary and ergodic path are given. We then study in more details statistical inference in two time series models on the simplex, based on either a Dirichlet or a multivariate logistic-normal conditional distribution. Usefulness of our models to analyze abundance data in ecosystems is also discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wildfire Risk Prediction: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01607v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wildfires have significant impacts on global vegetation, wildlife, and humans. They destroy plant communities and wildlife habitats and contribute to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and other pollutants. The prediction of wildfires relies on various independent variables combined with regression or machine learning methods. In this technical review, we describe the options for independent variables, data processing techniques, models, independent variables collinearity and importance estimation methods, and model performance evaluation metrics. First, we divide the independent variables into 4 aspects, including climate and meteorology conditions, socio-economical factors, terrain and hydrological features, and wildfire historical records. Second, preprocessing methods are described for different magnitudes, different spatial-temporal resolutions, and different formats of data. Third, the collinearity and importance evaluation methods of independent variables are also considered. Fourth, we discuss the application of statistical models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in wildfire risk prediction. In this subsection, compared with other reviews, this manuscript particularly discusses the evaluation metrics and recent advancements in deep learning methods. Lastly, addressing the limitations of current research, this paper emphasizes the need for more effective deep learning time series forecasting algorithms, the utilization of three-dimensional data including ground and trunk fuel, extraction of more accurate historical fire point data, and improved model evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reputation-Driven Asynchronous Federated Learning for Enhanced Trajectory Prediction with Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19428v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning combined with blockchain empowers secure data sharing in autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Human Trajectory Prediction with Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18756v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of human trajectories is important for planning in autonomous systems that act in the real world, e.g. automated driving or mobile robots. Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

By harnessing recent progress in tracking, specifically point trajectories and self-supervised representation learning, we build trajectory-aligned tokens (TATs) that capture motion and appearance information. This approach significantly reduces the data requirements while retaining essential information. To process these representations, we use a Masked Space-time Transformer that effectively learns to aggregate information to facilitate few-shot action recognition.

| **[Trajectory Planning Using Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Overtaking Maneuvers in Autonomous Racing Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10658v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous racing are based on the sequential execution of prediction of the opposing vehicles and subsequent trajectory planning for the ego vehicle. If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

| **[Exploring Commercial Vehicle Detouring Patterns through the Application of Probe Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17319v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding motorist detouring behavior is critical for both traffic operations and planning applications. However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

Results indicate the proposed filtering algorithm robustly extracts clean, long, and uninterrupted trajectories for further processing.

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |

However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research. To support continued research, all source code has been made available under an open-source license.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security & Trust (PST 2024)</p></details> |

The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |

We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures. Moreover, owing to its adaptive nature, it exhibits enhanced stability in the face of parameter variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most prevalent distance-based vessel trajectory clustering methods, which encompass two main steps: trajectory similarity measurement and clustering. Initially, we conducted a thorough literature review using relevant keywords to gather and summarize pertinent research papers and datasets. Then, this paper discussed the principal methods of data pre-processing that prepare data for further analysis. The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering.

| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13431v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples is a key performance indicator of a trajectory prediction model. However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding, painting, path following, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a comparative analysis of trajectory planning algorithms and their key software elements working strategy in complex and dynamic environments. Adaptability and real-time analysis are the most common problems in trajectory planning. The paper primarily focuses on getting a better understanding of these unpredictable environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning Using Tire Thermodynamics for Automated Drifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12989v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vehicles need to estimate tire-road friction information, as it plays a key role in safe trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics control. Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted from IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (IV 2024) and will be published late August</p></details> |
| **[Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces for Safety-critical Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12624v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Useful robot control algorithms should not only achieve performance objectives but also adhere to hard safety constraints. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training ST Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

| **[Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Enabled Emergency Wireless Communications Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11896v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |

As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Towards Personalised Patient Risk Prediction Using Temporal Hospital Data Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09373v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying a patient's health status provides clinicians with insight into patient risk, and the ability to better triage and manage resources. Early Warning Scores (EWS) are widely deployed to measure overall health status, and risk of adverse outcomes, in hospital patients. However, current EWS are limited both by their lack of personalisation and use of static observations. We propose a pipeline that groups intensive care unit patients by the trajectories of observations data throughout their stay as a basis for the development of personalised risk predictions. Feature importance is considered to provide model explainability. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, six clusters were identified, capturing differences in disease codes, observations, lengths of admissions and outcomes. Applying the pipeline to data from just the first four hours of each ICU stay assigns the majority of patients to the same cluster as when the entire stay duration is considered. In-hospital mortality prediction models trained on individual clusters had higher F1 score performance in five of the six clusters when compared against the unclustered patient cohort. The pipeline could form the basis of a clinical decision support tool, working to improve the clinical characterisation of risk groups and the early detection of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |

Location-Based Services (LBS) capitalize on this trajectory data to offer users personalized services tailored to their location information. However, this trajectory data contains sensitive information about users' movement patterns and habits, necessitating confidentiality and protection from unknown collectors. To address this challenge, privacy-preserving methods like K-anonymity and Differential Privacy have been proposed to safeguard private information in the dataset. Despite their effectiveness, these methods can impact the original features by introducing perturbations or generating unrealistic trajectory data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Federated Variational AutoEncoder (FedVAE) approach, which effectively generates a new trajectory dataset while preserving the confidentiality of private information and retaining the structure of the original features. In addition, FedVAE leverages Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to maintain the original feature space and generate new trajectory data, and incorporates Federated Learning (FL) during the training stage, ensuring that users' data remains locally stored to protect their personal information. The results demonstrate its superior performance compared to other existing methods, affirming FedVAE as a promising solution for enhancing data privacy and utility in location-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE 98th Vehicular Technology Conference</p></details> |
| **[Any-point Trajectory Modeling for Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00025v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is a powerful method for teaching robots new skills, and having more demonstration data often improves policy learning. However, the high cost of collecting demonstration data is a significant bottleneck. Videos, as a rich data source, contain knowledge of behaviors, physics, and semantics, but extracting control-specific information from them is challenging due to the lack of action labels. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Any-point Trajectory Modeling (ATM), that utilizes video demonstrations by pre-training a trajectory model to predict future trajectories of arbitrary points within a video frame. Once trained, these trajectories provide detailed control guidance, enabling the learning of robust visuomotor policies with minimal action-labeled data. Across over 130 language-conditioned tasks we evaluated in both simulation and the real world, ATM outperforms strong video pre-training baselines by 80% on average. Furthermore, we show effective transfer learning of manipulation skills from human videos and videos from a different robot morphology.

A novel energy function optimization-based framework is proposed to generate prediction trajectories. Firstly, a new energy function is designed for easier optimization. Secondly, an online optimization pipeline for calculating parameters and agents' velocities is developed. In this pipeline, we first design an efficient group division method based on Frechet distance to classify agents online. Then the strategy on decoupling the optimization of velocities and critical parameters in the energy function is developed, where the the slap swarm algorithm and gradient descent algorithms are integrated to solve the optimization problems more efficiently. Thirdly, we propose a similarity-based resample evaluation algorithm to predict agents' optimal goals, defined as the target-moving headings of agents, which effectively extracts hidden information in observed states and avoids learning agents' destinations via the training dataset in advance. Experiments and comparison studies verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some typos.

| **[Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06653v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is typically posed as a zero-shot generalization problem: a predictor is learnt on a dataset of human motion in training scenes, and then deployed on unseen test scenes. While this paradigm has yielded tremendous progress, it fundamentally assumes that trends in human behavior within the deployment scene are constant over time. As such, current prediction models are unable to adapt to scene-specific transient human behaviors, such as crowds temporarily gathering to see buskers, pedestrians hurrying through the rain and avoiding puddles, or a protest breaking out. We formalize the problem of scene-specific adaptive trajectory prediction and propose a new adaptation approach inspired by prompt tuning called latent corridors. By augmenting the input of any pre-trained human trajectory predictor with learnable image prompts, the predictor can improve in the deployment scene by inferring trends from extremely small amounts of new data (e.g., 2 humans observed for 30 seconds). With less than 0.1% additional model parameters, we see up to 23.9% ADE improvement in MOTSynth simulated data and 16.4% ADE in MOT and Wildtrack real pedestrian data. Qualitatively, we observe that latent corridors imbue predictors with an awareness of scene geometry and scene-specific human behaviors that non-adaptive predictors struggle to capture.

| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectories Forecasting with Probabilistic Feature Fusion for Problem Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v6)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of boosting the precision of multi-path long-term vessel trajectory forecasting on engineered sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using feature fusion for problem shifting. We have developed a deep auto-encoder model and a phased framework approach to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. To this end, we fuse the spatiotemporal features from the AIS messages with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data referring to potential routes and destinations. As a result, we reduce the forecasting uncertainty by shifting the problem into a trajectory reconstruction problem. The probabilistic features have an F1-Score of approximately 85% and 75% for the vessel route and destination prediction, respectively. Under such circumstances, we achieved an R2 Score of over 98% with different layer structures and varying feature combinations; the high R2 Score is a natural outcome of the well-defined shipping lanes in the study region. However, our proposal stands out among competing approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making during turnings and route selection. Furthermore, we have shown that our model achieves more accurate forecasting with average and median errors of 11km and 6km, respectively, a 25% improvement from the current state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting model from this proposal is deployed as part of a broader Decision Support System to safeguard whales by preventing the risk of vessel-whale collisions under the smartWhales initiative and acting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Atlantic Canada.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02502v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference; Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[The Hybrid Extended Bicycle: A Simple Model for High Dynamic Vehicle Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04857v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While highly automated driving relies most of the time on a smooth driving assumption, the possibility of a vehicle performing harsh maneuvers with high dynamic driving to face unexpected events is very likely. The modeling of the behavior of the vehicle in these events is crucial to proper planning and controlling; the used model should present accurate and computationally efficient properties to ensure consistency with the dynamics of the vehicle and to be employed in real-time systems. In this article, we propose an LSTM-based hybrid extended bicycle model able to present an accurate description of the state of the vehicle for both normal and aggressive situations. The introduced model is used in a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) plan and control framework for performing trajectories in high-dynamic scenarios. The proposed model and framework prove their ability to plan feasible trajectories ensuring an accurate vehicle behavior even at the limits of handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[CATP: Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction with Competition Symbiosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07328v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual information is vital for accurate trajectory prediction. For instance, the intricate flying behavior of migratory birds hinges on their analysis of environmental cues such as wind direction and air pressure. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of contextual information renders it an arduous task for AI models to comprehend its impact on trajectories and consequently predict them accurately. To address this issue, we propose a ``manager-worker'' framework to unleash the full potential of contextual information and construct CATP model, an implementation of the framework for Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction. The framework comprises a manager model, several worker models, and a tailored training mechanism inspired by competition symbiosis in nature. Taking CATP as an example, each worker needs to compete against others for training data and develop an advantage in predicting specific moving patterns. The manager learns the workers' performance in different contexts and selects the best one in the given context to predict trajectories, enabling CATP as a whole to operate in a symbiotic manner. We conducted two comparative experiments and an ablation study to quantitatively evaluate the proposed framework and CATP model. The results showed that CATP could outperform SOTA models, and the framework could be generalized to different context-aware tasks.</p></details> |  |

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the ER through trajectory and jamming power optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal for review</p></details> |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v4)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction model (HLTP++), which emulates human cognitive processes to improve trajectory prediction in AD. HLTP++ incorporates a novel teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The "teacher" model equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. On the other hand, the "student" model focuses on real-time interaction and human decision-making, drawing parallels to the human memory storage mechanism. Furthermore, we improve the model's efficiency by introducing a new Fourier Adaptive Spike Neural Network (FA-SNN), allowing for faster and more precise predictions with fewer parameters. Evaluated using the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD benchmarks, HLTP++ demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, which reduces the predicted trajectory error with over 11% on the NGSIM dataset and 25% on the HighD datasets. Moreover, HLTP++ demonstrates strong adaptability in challenging environments with incomplete input data. This marks a significant stride in the journey towards fully AD systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2402.19251</p></details> |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLP 2024</p></details> |

However, prevalent methods often assume complete observed trajectories, neglecting the potential impact of missing values induced by object occlusion, scope limitation, and sensor failures. Such oversights inevitably compromise the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed Multiscale Transformer (MSTF), meticulously crafted for incomplete trajectory prediction. MSTF integrates a Multiscale Attention Head (MAH) and an Information Increment-based Pattern Adaptive (IIPA) module. Specifically, the MAH component concurrently captures multiscale motion representation of trajectory sequence from various temporal granularities, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism. This approach facilitates the modeling of global dependencies in motion across different scales, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, the IIPA module adaptively extracts continuity representation of motion across time steps by analyzing missing patterns in the data. The continuity representation delineates motion trend at a higher level, guiding MSTF to generate predictions consistent with motion continuity. We evaluate our proposed MSTF model using two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MSTF surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the task of incomplete trajectory prediction, showcasing its efficacy in addressing the challenges posed by missing values in motion forecasting for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

A data-driven approach consists on to deduce behaviors that may exist in real situation to obtain different types of trajectories from a large set of observations. The data, and its classification, could then be used to train models capable to extrapolate such behavior. Cars and two different types of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) will be considered by the trajectory clustering methods proposed: pedestrians and cyclists. The results reported here evaluate methods to extract well-defined trajectory classes from raw data without the use of map information while also separating ''eccentric'' or incomplete trajectories from the ones that are complete and representative in any scenario. Two environments will serve as test for the methods develop, three different intersections and one roundabout. The resulting clusters of trajectories can then be used for prediction or learning tasks or discarded if it is composed by outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PWTO: A Heuristic Approach for Trajectory Optimization in Complex Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02745v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a trajectory planning problem for a robot navigating complex terrains, which arises in applications ranging from autonomous mining vehicles to planetary rovers. The problem seeks to find a low-cost dynamically feasible trajectory for the robot. The problem is challenging as it requires solving a non-linear optimization problem that often has many local minima due to the complex terrain. To address the challenge, we propose a method called Pareto-optimal Warm-started Trajectory Optimization (PWTO) that attempts to combine the benefits of graph search and trajectory optimization, two very different approaches to planning. PWTO first creates a state lattice using simplified dynamics of the robot and leverages a multi-objective graph search method to obtain a set of paths. Each of the paths is then used to warm-start a local trajectory optimization process, so that different local minima are explored to find a globally low-cost solution. In our tests, the solution cost computed by PWTO is often less than half of the costs computed by the baselines. In addition, we verify the trajectories generated by PWTO in Gazebo simulation in complex terrains with both wheeled and quadruped robots. The code of this paper is open sourced and can be found at https://github.com/rap-lab-org/public_pwto.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  |

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to re-plan folding trajectory at every time-step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from geometric features. These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths. Our experiments demonstrate AdaFold's ability to adapt folding trajectories to cloths with varying physical properties and generalize from simulated training to real-world execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Small Aerial Target Detection for Airborne Infrared Detection Systems using LightGBM and Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01278v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factors, such as rapid relative motion, clutter background, etc., make robust small aerial target detection for airborne infrared detection systems a challenge. Existing methods are facing difficulties when dealing with such cases. We consider that a continuous and smooth trajectory is critical in boosting small infrared aerial target detection performance. A simple and effective small aerial target detection method for airborne infrared detection system using light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) and trajectory constraints is proposed in this article. First, we simply formulate target candidate detection as a binary classification problem. Target candidates in every individual frame are detected via interesting pixel detection and a trained LightGBM model. Then, the local smoothness and global continuous characteristic of the target trajectory are modeled as short-strict and long-loose constraints. The trajectory constraints are used efficiently for detecting the true small infrared aerial targets from numerous target candidates. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other existing methods. Furthermore, a public dataset for small aerial target detection in airborne infrared detection systems is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset has the largest data scale and richest scene types within this field.</p></details> | 15 pages,10 figures |

The core idea is to decompose state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks, LLMs, and Table Neural Networks into standardized modules, to enable the fast construction of novel RTL-type models in a simple "combine, align, and co-train" manner. To illustrate the usage of rLLM, we introduce a simple RTL method named \textbf{BRIDGE}. Additionally, we present three novel relational tabular datasets (TML1M, TLF2K, and TACM12K) by enhancing classic datasets. We hope rLLM can serve as a useful and easy-to-use development framework for RTL-related tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rllm-project/rllm.</p></details> |  |
| **[xAI-Drop: Don't Use What You Cannot Explain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20067v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant paradigm for learning from graph-structured data, offering a wide range of applications from social network analysis to bioinformatics. Despite their versatility, GNNs face challenges such as oversmoothing, lack of generalization and poor interpretability, which hinder their wider adoption and reliability in critical applications. Dropping has emerged as an effective paradigm for reducing noise during training and improving robustness of GNNs. However, existing approaches often rely on random or heuristic-based selection criteria, lacking a principled method to identify and exclude nodes that contribute to noise and over-complexity in the model. In this work, we argue that explainability should be a key indicator of a model's robustness throughout its training phase. To this end, we introduce xAI-Drop, a novel topological-level dropping regularizer that leverages explainability to pinpoint noisy network elements to be excluded from the GNN propagation mechanism. An empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art dropping approaches in accuracy, effectively reduces over-smoothing, and improves explanation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCo: A Coupled Contrastive Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04979v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive achievements in graph classification, they often need abundant task-specific labels, which could be extensively costly to acquire. A credible solution is to explore additional labeled graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply GNNs to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning (CoCo), which extracts the topological information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with coupled contrastive learning. CoCo contains a graph convolutional network branch and a hierarchical graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. Besides, we incorporate coupled branches into a holistic multi-view contrastive learning framework, which not only incorporates graph representations learned from complementary views for enhanced understanding, but also encourages the similarity between cross-domain example pairs with the same semantics for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our CoCo outperforms these competing baselines in different settings generally.</p></details> |  |
| **[RelBench: A Benchmark for Deep Learning on Relational Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20060v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RelBench, a public benchmark for solving predictive tasks over relational databases with graph neural networks. RelBench provides databases and tasks spanning diverse domains and scales, and is intended to be a foundational infrastructure for future research. We use RelBench to conduct the first comprehensive study of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) (Fey et al., 2024), which combines graph neural network predictive models with (deep) tabular models that extract initial entity-level representations from raw tables. End-to-end learned RDL models fully exploit the predictive signal encoded in primary-foreign key links, marking a significant shift away from the dominant paradigm of manual feature engineering combined with tabular models. To thoroughly evaluate RDL against this prior gold-standard, we conduct an in-depth user study where an experienced data scientist manually engineers features for each task. In this study, RDL learns better models whilst reducing human work needed by more than an order of magnitude. This demonstrates the power of deep learning for solving predictive tasks over relational databases, opening up many new research opportunities enabled by RelBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spiking Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05373v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is gradually attracting attention due to the low power consumption and high efficiency in processing the non-Euclidean data represented by graphs. However, as a common problem, dynamic graph representation learning faces challenges such as high complexity and large memory overheads. Current work often uses SNNs instead of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by using binary features instead of continuous ones for efficient training, which would overlooks graph structure information and leads to the loss of details during propagation. Additionally, optimizing dynamic spiking models typically requires propagation of information across time steps, which increases memory requirements. To address these challenges, we present a framework named \underline{Dy}namic \underline{S}p\underline{i}king \underline{G}raph \underline{N}eural Networks (\method{}). To mitigate the information loss problem, \method{} propagates early-layer information directly to the last layer for information compensation. To accommodate the memory requirements, we apply the implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state, which does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. While traditional implicit differentiation methods are usually used for static situations, \method{} extends it to the dynamic graph setting. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world dynamic graph datasets validate the effectiveness of \method{} on dynamic node classification tasks with lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi-Framelets: Robust Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive Framelet Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04728v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to provide a novel design of a multiscale framelet convolution for spectral graph neural networks (GNNs). While current spectral methods excel in various graph learning tasks, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to noisy, incomplete, or perturbed graph signals, making them fragile in such conditions. Our newly proposed framelet convolution addresses these limitations by decomposing graph data into low-pass and high-pass spectra through a finely-tuned multiscale approach. Our approach directly designs filtering functions within the spectral domain, allowing for precise control over the spectral components. The proposed design excels in filtering out unwanted spectral information and significantly reduces the adverse effects of noisy graph signals. Our approach not only enhances the robustness of GNNs but also preserves crucial graph features and structures. Through extensive experiments on diverse, real-world graph datasets, we demonstrate that our framelet convolution achieves superior performance in node classification tasks. It exhibits remarkable resilience to noisy data and adversarial attacks, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for real-world graph applications. This advancement opens new avenues for more adaptive and reliable spectral GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise-Resilient Unsupervised Graph Representation Learning via Multi-Hop Feature Quality Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19944v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised graph representation learning (UGRL) based on graph neural networks (GNNs), has received increasing attention owing to its efficacy in handling graph-structured data. However, existing UGRL methods ideally assume that the node features are noise-free, which makes them fail to distinguish between useful information and noise when applied to real data with noisy features, thus affecting the quality of learned representations. This urges us to take node noisy features into account in real-world UGRL. With empirical analysis, we reveal that feature propagation, the essential operation in GNNs, acts as a "double-edged sword" in handling noisy features - it can both denoise and diffuse noise, leading to varying feature quality across nodes, even within the same node at different hops. Building on this insight, we propose a novel UGRL method based on Multi-hop feature Quality Estimation (MQE for short). Unlike most UGRL models that directly utilize propagation-based GNNs to generate representations, our approach aims to learn representations through estimating the quality of propagated features at different hops. Specifically, we introduce a Gaussian model that utilizes a learnable "meta-representation" as a condition to estimate the expectation and variance of multi-hop propagated features via neural networks. In this way, the "meta representation" captures the semantic and structural information underlying multiple propagated features but is naturally less susceptible to interference by noise, thereby serving as high-quality node representations beneficial for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that MQE in learning reliable node representations in scenarios with diverse types of feature noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024. 11 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Aero-Nef: Neural Fields for Rapid Aircraft Aerodynamics Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19916v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a methodology to learn surrogate models of steady state fluid dynamics simulations on meshed domains, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). The proposed models can be applied directly to unstructured domains for different flow conditions, handle non-parametric 3D geometric variations, and generalize to unseen shapes at test time. The coordinate-based formulation naturally leads to robustness with respect to discretization, allowing an excellent trade-off between computational cost (memory footprint and training time) and accuracy. The method is demonstrated on two industrially relevant applications: a RANS dataset of the two-dimensional compressible flow over a transonic airfoil and a dataset of the surface pressure distribution over 3D wings, including shape, inflow condition, and control surface deflection variations. On the considered test cases, our approach achieves a more than three times lower test error and significantly improves generalization error on unseen geometries compared to state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architectures. Remarkably, the method can perform inference five order of magnitude faster than the high fidelity solver on the RANS transonic airfoil dataset.

However, we argue that existing multi-modal recommender systems typically use isolated processes for both feature extraction and modality modelling. Such isolated processes can harm the recommendation performance. Firstly, an isolated extraction process underestimates the importance of effective feature extraction in multi-modal recommendations, potentially incorporating non-relevant information, which is harmful to item representations. Second, an isolated modality modelling process produces disjointed embeddings for item modalities due to the individual processing of each modality, which leads to a suboptimal fusion of user/item representations for effective user preferences prediction. We hypothesise that the use of a unified model for addressing both aforementioned isolated processes will enable the consistent extraction and cohesive fusion of joint multi-modal features, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called Unified Multi-modal Graph Transformer (UGT), which firstly leverages a multi-way transformer to extract aligned multi-modal features from raw data for top-k recommendation. Subsequently, we build a unified graph neural network in our UGT model to jointly fuse the user/item representations with their corresponding multi-modal features. Using the graph transformer architecture of our UGT model, we show that the UGT model can achieve significant effectiveness gains, especially when jointly optimised with the commonly-used multi-modal recommendation losses.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Shape of Money Laundering: Subgraph Representation Learning on the Blockchain with the Elliptic2 Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19109v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph representation learning is a technique for analyzing local structures (or shapes) within complex networks. Enabled by recent developments in scalable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this approach encodes relational information at a subgroup level (multiple connected nodes) rather than at a node level of abstraction. We posit that certain domain applications, such as anti-money laundering (AML), are inherently subgraph problems and mainstream graph techniques have been operating at a suboptimal level of abstraction. This is due in part to the scarcity of annotated datasets of real-world size and complexity, as well as the lack of software tools for managing subgraph GNN workflows at scale. To enable work in fundamental algorithms as well as domain applications in AML and beyond, we introduce Elliptic2, a large graph dataset containing 122K labeled subgraphs of Bitcoin clusters within a background graph consisting of 49M node clusters and 196M edge transactions. The dataset provides subgraphs known to be linked to illicit activity for learning the set of "shapes" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity. Along with the dataset we share our graph techniques, software tooling, promising early experimental results, and new domain insights already gleaned from this approach. Taken together, we find immediate practical value in this approach and the potential for a new standard in anti-money laundering and forensic analytics in cryptocurrencies and other financial networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD M...</summary><p>KDD MLF Workshop 2024.

We analyze poly-GNNs under a general contextual stochastic block model (CSBM) by providing a sharp characterization of the rate of separation between classes in their output node representations. A question of interest is whether this rate depends on the depth of the network $k$, i.e., whether deeper networks can achieve a faster separation? We provide a negative answer to this question: for a sufficiently large graph, a depth $k > 1$ poly-GNN exhibits the same rate of separation as a depth $k=1$ counterpart. Our analysis highlights and quantifies the impact of ``graph noise'' in deep GNNs and shows how noise in the graph structure can dominate other sources of signal in the graph, negating any benefit further aggregation provides. Our analysis also reveals subtle differences between even and odd-layered GNNs in how the feature noise propagates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Triplet Importance for Personalized Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19469v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized item ranking has been a crucial component contributing to the performance of recommender systems. As a representative approach, pairwise ranking directly optimizes the ranking with user implicit feedback by constructing (\textit{user}, \textit{positive item}, \textit{negative item}) triplets. Several recent works have noticed that treating all triplets equally may hardly achieve the best effects. They assign different importance scores to negative items, user-item pairs, or triplets, respectively. However, almost all the generated importance scores are groundless and hard to interpret, thus far from trustworthy and transparent. To tackle these, we propose the \textit{Triplet Shapley} -- a Shapely value-based method to measure the triplet importance in an interpretable manner. Due to the huge number of triplets, we transform the original Shapley value calculation to the Monte Carlo (MC) approximation, where the guarantee for the approximation unbiasedness is also provided. To stabilize the MC approximation, we adopt a control covariates-based method. Finally, we utilize the triplet Shapley value to guide the resampling of important triplets for benefiting the model learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public datasets involving classical matrix factorization- and graph neural network-based recommendation models. Empirical results and subsequent analysis show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Reputation-Driven Asynchronous Federated Learning for Enhanced Trajectory Prediction with Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19428v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning combined with blockchain empowers secure data sharing in autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Over Molecular Conformer Ensembles: Datasets and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00115v2)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Representation Learning (MRL) has proven impactful in numerous biochemical applications such as drug discovery and enzyme design. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at learning molecular representations from a 2D molecular graph or a single 3D structure, existing works often overlook the flexible nature of molecules, which continuously interconvert across conformations via chemical bond rotations and minor vibrational perturbations. To better account for molecular flexibility, some recent works formulate MRL as an ensemble learning problem, focusing on explicitly learning from a set of conformer structures. However, most of these studies have limited datasets, tasks, and models. In this work, we introduce the first MoleculAR Conformer Ensemble Learning (MARCEL) benchmark to thoroughly evaluate the potential of learning on conformer ensembles and suggest promising research directions. MARCEL includes four datasets covering diverse molecule- and reaction-level properties of chemically diverse molecules including organocatalysts and transition-metal catalysts, extending beyond the scope of common GNN benchmarks that are confined to drug-like molecules. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study, which benchmarks representative 1D, 2D, and 3D molecular representation learning models, along with two strategies that explicitly incorporate conformer ensembles into 3D MRL models. Our findings reveal that direct learning from an accessible conformer space can improve performance on a variety of tasks and models.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

However, the graph data used for training may contain sensitive personal information of the involved individuals. Once trained, GNNs typically encode such information in their learnable parameters. As a consequence, privacy leakage may happen when the trained GNNs are deployed and exposed to potential attackers. Facing such a threat, machine unlearning for GNNs has become an emerging technique that aims to remove certain personal information from a trained GNN. Among these techniques, certified unlearning stands out, as it provides a solid theoretical guarantee of the information removal effectiveness. Nevertheless, most of the existing certified unlearning methods for GNNs are only designed to handle node and edge unlearning requests. Meanwhile, these approaches are usually tailored for either a specific design of GNN or a specially designed training objective. These disadvantages significantly jeopardize their flexibility. In this paper, we propose a principled framework named IDEA to achieve flexible and certified unlearning for GNNs. Specifically, we first instantiate four types of unlearning requests on graphs, and then we propose an approximation approach to flexibly handle these unlearning requests over diverse GNNs. We further provide theoretical guarantee of the effectiveness for the proposed approach as a certification. Different from existing alternatives, IDEA is not designed for any specific GNNs or optimization objectives to perform certified unlearning, and thus can be easily generalized. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDEA in multiple key perspectives.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Network (GNN) Explainers have shown potential in subgraph identification, existing methods with GNN often offer associative rather than causal insights. This lack of transparency and explainability hinders our understanding of their results and also underlying mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of causal link/subgraph inference, called CIDER: Counterfactual-Invariant Diffusion-based GNN ExplaineR, by implementing both counterfactual and diffusion implementations. In other words, it is a model-agnostic and task-agnostic framework for generating causal explanations based on a counterfactual-invariant and diffusion process, which provides not only causal subgraphs due to counterfactual implementation but reliable causal links due to the diffusion process. Specifically, CIDER is first formulated as an inference task that generatively provides the two distributions of one causal subgraph and another spurious subgraph. Then, to enhance the reliability, we further model the CIDER framework as a diffusion process. Thus, using the causal subgraph distribution, we can explicitly quantify the contribution of each subgraph to a phenotype/label in a counterfactual manner, representing each subgraph's causal strength. From a causality perspective, CIDER is an interventional causal method, different from traditional association studies or observational causal approaches, and can also reduce the effects of unobserved confounders. We evaluate CIDER on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which all demonstrate the superiority of CIDER over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors. The proposed approach highlights the importance of structured inductive biases for gaining improved generalization in complex biological prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, ICML Conference Workshop 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.18610</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Communication Enhanced by Knowledge Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19338v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the advantages of representing and processing semantic knowledge extracted into graphs within the emerging paradigm of semantic communications. The proposed approach leverages semantic and pragmatic aspects, incorporating recent advances on large language models (LLMs) to achieve compact representations of knowledge to be processed and exchanged between intelligent agents. This is accomplished by using the cascade of LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) as semantic encoders, where information to be shared is selected to be meaningful at the receiver. The embedding vectors produced by the proposed semantic encoder represent information in the form of triplets: nodes (semantic concepts entities), edges(relations between concepts), nodes. Thus, semantic information is associated with the representation of relationships among elements in the space of semantic concept abstractions. In this paper, we investigate the potential of achieving high compression rates in communication by incorporating relations that link elements within graph embeddings. We propose sending semantic symbols solely equivalent to node embeddings through the wireless channel and inferring the complete knowledge graph at the receiver. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of leveraging knowledge graphs to semantically compress and transmit information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 25th IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)</p></details> |
| **[Can Modifying Data Address Graph Domain Adaptation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19311v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous graph analytical tasks. Yet, their effectiveness is often compromised in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, limiting their capacity for knowledge transfer across changing environments or domains. Recently, Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) has been introduced to resolve this issue. UGDA aims to facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph. Current UGDA efforts primarily focus on model-centric methods, such as employing domain invariant learning strategies and designing model architectures. However, our critical examination reveals the limitations inherent to these model-centric methods, while a data-centric method allowed to modify the source graph provably demonstrates considerable potential. This insight motivates us to explore UGDA from a data-centric perspective. By revisiting the theoretical generalization bound for UGDA, we identify two data-centric principles for UGDA: alignment principle and rescaling principle. Guided by these principles, we propose GraphAlign, a novel UGDA method that generates a small yet transferable graph. By exclusively training a GNN on this new graph with classic Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), GraphAlign attains exceptional performance on the target graph. Extensive experiments under various transfer scenarios demonstrate the GraphAlign outperforms the best baselines by an average of 2.16%, training on the generated graph as small as 0.25~1% of the original training graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alleviating Over-Smoothing via Aggregation over Compact Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19231v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various applications. Most GNNs learn the node features with information aggregation of its neighbors and feature transformation in each layer. However, the node features become indistinguishable after many layers, leading to performance deterioration: a significant limitation known as over-smoothing. Past work adopted various techniques for addressing this issue, such as normalization and skip-connection of layer-wise output. After the study, we found that the information aggregations in existing work are all contracted aggregations, with the intrinsic property that features will inevitably converge to the same single point after many layers. To this end, we propose the aggregation over compacted manifolds method (ACM) that replaces the existing information aggregation with aggregation over compact manifolds, a special type of manifold, which avoids contracted aggregations. In this work, we theoretically analyze contracted aggregation and its properties. We also provide an extensive empirical evaluation that shows ACM can effectively alleviate over-smoothing and outperforms the state-of-the-art. The code can be found in https://github.com/DongzhuoranZhou/ACM.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by PAKDD 2024 as an oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks for Road-Level Traffic Accident Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05072v4)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic accidents present substantial challenges to human safety and socio-economic development in urban areas. Developing a reliable and responsible traffic accident prediction model is crucial to addressing growing public safety concerns and enhancing the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of highrisk accidents and the predominance of non-accident characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of accidents, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of accident risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Zero-Inflated Tweedie Graph Neural Network STZITDGNN -- the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in roadlevel traffic accident prediction for multisteps. This model integrates the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family model and the expressive power of graph neural networks. Its decoder innovatively employs a compound Tweedie model,a Poisson distribution to model the frequency of accident occurrences and a Gamma distribution to assess injury severity, supplemented by a zeroinflated component to effectively identify exessive nonincident instances. Empirical tests using realworld traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITDGNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks and metrics, including accident risk value prediction, uncertainty minimisation, non-accident road identification and accident occurrence accuracy. Our study demonstrates that STZTIDGNN can effectively inform targeted road monitoring, thereby improving urban road safety strategies.</p></details> |  |

We show that graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the structure of the heterogeneity from data alone. The learned latent structure and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to parameterize and infer the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of moving particles and vector fields that interact with each other. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 2 pages appendix, 2 supplementary tables, 18 supplementary figures, 13 videos linked to youtube</p></details> |
| **[Debiased Graph Poisoning Attack via Contrastive Surrogate Objective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19155v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which aim to degrade the performance of GNNs through imperceptible changes on the graph. However, we find that in fact the prevalent meta-gradient-based attacks, which utilizes the gradient of the loss w.r.t the adjacency matrix, are biased towards training nodes. That is, their meta-gradient is determined by a training procedure of the surrogate model, which is solely trained on the training nodes. This bias manifests as an uneven perturbation, connecting two nodes when at least one of them is a labeled node, i.e., training node, while it is unlikely to connect two unlabeled nodes. However, these biased attack approaches are sub-optimal as they do not consider flipping edges between two unlabeled nodes at all. This means that they miss the potential attacked edges between unlabeled nodes that significantly alter the representation of a node. In this paper, we investigate the meta-gradients to uncover the root cause of the uneven perturbations of existing attacks. Based on our analysis, we propose a Meta-gradient-based attack method using contrastive surrogate objective (Metacon), which alleviates the bias in meta-gradient using a new surrogate loss. We conduct extensive experiments to show that Metacon outperforms existing meta gradient-based attack methods through benchmark datasets, while showing that alleviating the bias towards training nodes is effective in attacking the graph structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages.

These capabilities are vital for developing advanced technologies across fields such as energy, electronics, and biomedicine, potentially reducing the time and resources needed for new material exploration and promoting rapid innovation cycles. Recent efforts have focused on employing advanced ML algorithms, including deep learning - based graph neural network, for property prediction. Additionally, ensemble models have proven to enhance the generalizability and robustness of ML and DL. However, the use of such ensemble strategies in deep graph networks for material property prediction remains underexplored. Our research provides an in-depth evaluation of ensemble strategies in deep learning - based graph neural network, specifically targeting material property prediction tasks. By testing the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN) and its multitask version, MT-CGCNN, we demonstrated that ensemble techniques, especially prediction averaging, substantially improve precision beyond traditional metrics for key properties like formation energy per atom ($\Delta E^{f}$), band gap ($E_{g}$) and density ($\rho$) in 33,990 stable inorganic materials. These findings support the broader application of ensemble methods to enhance predictive accuracy in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

[2018]), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. [2019]). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Graph Neural Network (BPB-GNN), an architecture that resembles residual networks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-GNN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-GNN in the narrow width limit is generally superior or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18772v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks, with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to better understand and improve supply chains, and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for this setting, by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data, along with data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models successfully infer production functions, with a 6-50% improvement over baselines, and forecast future transactions on real and synthetic data, outperforming baselines by 11-62%.</p></details> |  |

AutoRDF2GML enables, for the first time, the creation of both content-based features -- i.e., features based on RDF datatype properties -- and topology-based features -- i.e., features based on RDF object properties. Characterized by automated feature extraction, AutoRDF2GML makes it possible even for users less familiar with RDF and SPARQL to generate data representations ready for graph machine learning tasks, such as link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. Furthermore, we present four new benchmark datasets for graph machine learning, created from large RDF knowledge graphs using our framework. These datasets serve as valuable resources for evaluating graph machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks. Overall, our framework effectively bridges the gap between the Graph Machine Learning and Semantic Web communities, paving the way for RDF-based machine learning applications.</p></details> | accepted at ISWC'24 |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Virtual Sensing in Complex Systems: Addressing Heterogeneous Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18691v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper extends our previous conference paper (Best Paper at European Conference of the PHM Society 2024, https://doi.org/10.36001/phme.2024.v8i1.3998)</p></details> |
| **[DTFormer: A Transformer-Based Method for Discrete-Time Dynamic Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18523v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs), which are prevalent in real-world implementations and notable for their ease of data acquisition, have garnered considerable attention from both academic researchers and industry practitioners. The representation learning of DTDGs has been extensively applied to model the dynamics of temporally changing entities and their evolving connections. Currently, DTDG representation learning predominantly relies on GNN+RNN architectures, which manifest the inherent limitations of both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing issue as the models architecture goes deeper, while RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies effectively. GNN+RNN architectures also grapple with scaling to large graph sizes and long sequences. Additionally, these methods often compute node representations separately and focus solely on individual node characteristics, thereby overlooking the behavior intersections between the two nodes whose link is being predicted, such as instances where the two nodes appear together in the same context or share common neighbors. This paper introduces a novel representation learning method DTFormer for DTDGs, pivoting from the traditional GNN+RNN framework to a Transformer-based architecture. Our approach exploits the attention mechanism to concurrently process topological information within the graph at each timestamp and temporal dynamics of graphs along the timestamps, circumventing the aforementioned fundamental weakness of both GNNs and RNNs. Moreover, we enhance the model's expressive capability by incorporating the intersection relationships among nodes and integrating a multi-patching module. Extensive experiments conducted on six public dynamic graph benchmark datasets confirm our model's efficacy, achieving the SOTA performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[TCGPN: Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network for Stock Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18519v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the incorporation of both temporal features and the correlation across time series has become an effective approach in time series prediction. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) demonstrate good performance on many Temporal-correlation Forecasting Problem. However, when applied to tasks lacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and robustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by memory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize Temporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and pre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation pre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of nodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And memory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through multiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets CSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP in downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the capability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Graph Compressed Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18480v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective graph neural networks (GNNs) with message passing has two fundamental challenges, i.e., determining optimal message-passing pathways and designing local aggregators. Previous methods of designing optimal pathways are limited with information loss on the input features. On the other hand, existing local aggregators generally fail to extract multi-scale features and approximate diverse operators under limited parameter scales. In contrast to these methods, Euclidean convolution has been proven as an expressive aggregator, making it a perfect candidate for GNN construction. However, the challenges of generalizing Euclidean convolution to graphs arise from the irregular structure of graphs. To bridge the gap between Euclidean space and graph topology, we propose a differentiable method that applies permutations to calibrate input graphs for Euclidean convolution. The permutations constrain all nodes in a row regardless of their input order and therefore enable the flexible generalization of Euclidean convolution to graphs. Based on the graph calibration, we propose the Compressed Convolution Network (CoCN) for hierarchical graph representation learning. CoCN follows local feature-learning and global parameter-sharing mechanisms of convolution neural networks. The whole model can be trained end-to-end, with compressed convolution applied to learn individual node features and their corresponding structure features. CoCN can further borrow successful practices from Euclidean convolution, including residual connection and inception mechanism. We validate CoCN on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks. CoCN achieves superior performance over competitive GNN baselines. Codes are available at https://github.com/sunjss/CoCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-turn Response Selection with Commonsense-enhanced Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18479v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a branch of advanced artificial intelligence, dialogue systems are prospering. Multi-turn response selection is a general research problem in dialogue systems. With the assistance of background information and pre-trained language models, the performance of state-of-the-art methods on this problem gains impressive improvement. However, existing studies neglect the importance of external commonsense knowledge. Hence, we design a Siamese network where a pre-trained Language model merges with a Graph neural network (SinLG). SinLG takes advantage of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to catch the word correlations in the context and response candidates and utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to reason helpful common sense from an external knowledge graph. The GNN aims to assist the PLM in fine-tuning, and arousing its related memories to attain better performance. Specifically, we first extract related concepts as nodes from an external knowledge graph to construct a subgraph with the context response pair as a super node for each sample. Next, we learn two representations for the context response pair via both the PLM and GNN. A similarity loss between the two representations is utilized to transfer the commonsense knowledge from the GNN to the PLM. Then only the PLM is used to infer online so that efficiency can be guaranteed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two variants of the PERSONA-CHAT dataset, which proves that our solution can not only improve the performance of the PLM but also achieve an efficient inference.</p></details> |  |

| **[AsEP: Benchmarking Deep Learning Methods for Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18184v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epitope identification is vital for antibody design yet challenging due to the inherent variability in antibodies. While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question. The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity. We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction). AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods. AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods. Based on this new dataset, we benchmarked various representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances are not satisfactory as expected for epitope prediction. We thus propose a new method, WALLE, that leverages both protein language models and graph neural networks. WALLE demonstrate about 5X performance gain over existing methods. Our empirical findings evidence that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential embeddings provided by language models and geometrical information from graph representations, providing a guideline for future method design. In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing easy model performance attribution and interpretability. We open-source our data and code at https://github.com/biochunan/AsEP-dataset.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we tackle this challenge by leveraging the single-cell BERT-based pre-trained transformer model (scBERT), trained on extensive unlabeled scRNA-seq data, to augment structured biological knowledge from existing GRNs. We introduce a novel joint graph learning approach that combines the rich contextual representations learned by pre-trained single-cell language models with the structured knowledge encoded in GRNs using graph neural networks (GNNs). By integrating these two modalities, our approach effectively reasons over boththe gene expression level constraints provided by the scRNA-seq data and the structured biological knowledge inherent in GRNs. We evaluate our method on human cell benchmark datasets from the BEELINE study with cell type-specific ground truth networks. The results demonstrate superior performance over current state-of-the-art baselines, offering a deeper understanding of cellular regulatory mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into the ICML 2024 AI for Science workshop</p></details> |

To help researchers develop more robust GNN models, it's essential to focus on designing strong attack models as foundational benchmarks and guiding references. Among adversarial attacks, gray-box poisoning attacks are noteworthy due to their effectiveness and fewer constraints. These attacks exploit GNNs' need for retraining on updated data, thereby impacting their performance by perturbing these datasets. However, current research overlooks the real-world scenario of incomplete graphs.To address this gap, we introduce the Robust Incomplete Deep Attack Framework (RIDA). It is the first algorithm for robust gray-box poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs. The approach innovatively aggregates distant vertex information and ensures powerful data utilization.Extensive tests against 9 SOTA baselines on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate RIDA's superiority in handling incompleteness and high attack performance on the incomplete graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expressivity and Generalization: Fragment-Biases for Molecular GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08210v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent advances in higher-order Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) improve the theoretical expressiveness and molecular property predictive performance, they often fall short of the empirical performance of models that explicitly use fragment information as inductive bias. However, for these approaches, there exists no theoretic expressivity study. In this work, we propose the Fragment-WL test, an extension to the well-known Weisfeiler & Leman (WL) test, which enables the theoretic analysis of these fragment-biased GNNs. Building on the insights gained from the Fragment-WL test, we develop a new GNN architecture and a fragmentation with infinite vocabulary that significantly boosts expressiveness. We show the effectiveness of our model on synthetic and real-world data where we outperform all GNNs on Peptides and have 12% lower error than all GNNs on ZINC and 34% lower error than other fragment-biased models. Furthermore, we show that our model exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to the latest transformer-based architectures, positioning it as a robust solution for a range of molecular modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized and Context-aware Route Planning for Edge-assisted Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17980v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional route planning services typically offer the same routes to all drivers, focusing primarily on a few standardized factors such as travel distance or time, overlooking individual driver preferences. With the inception of autonomous vehicles expected in the coming years, where vehicles will rely on routes decided by such planners, there arises a need to incorporate the specific preferences of each driver, ensuring personalized navigation experiences. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aimed at customizing routes to suit individual preferences. By analyzing the historical trajectories of individual drivers, we classify their driving behavior and associate it with relevant road attributes as indicators of driver preferences. The GNN is capable of representing the road network as graph-structured data effectively, while DRL is capable of making decisions utilizing reward mechanisms to optimize route selection with factors such as travel costs, congestion level, and driver satisfaction. We evaluate our proposed GNN-based DRL framework using a real-world road network and demonstrate its ability to accommodate driver preferences, offering a range of route options tailored to individual drivers. The results indicate that our framework can select routes that accommodate driver's preferences with up to a 17% improvement compared to a generic route planner, and reduce the travel time by 33% (afternoon) and 46% (evening) relatively to the shortest distance-based approach.</p></details> |  |

By fostering new levels of automation, efficiency, and predictive maintenance, IIoT is transforming traditional industries into intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems. However, achieving highly reliable IIoT can be hindered by factors such as the cost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting existing systems with sensors, or harsh environmental conditions that may make sensor installation impractical. Soft (virtual) sensing leverages mathematical models to estimate variables from physical sensor data, offering a solution to these challenges. Data-driven and physics-based modeling are the two main methodologies widely used for soft sensing. The choice between these strategies depends on the complexity of the underlying system, with the data-driven approach often being preferred when the physics-based inference models are intricate and present challenges for state estimation. However, conventional deep learning models are typically hindered by their inability to explicitly represent the complex interactions among various sensors. To address this limitation, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), renowned for their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between sensor measurements. In this research, we propose physics-enhanced GNNs, which integrate principles of physics into graph-based methodologies. This is achieved by augmenting additional nodes in the input graph derived from the underlying characteristics of the physical processes. Our evaluation of the proposed methodology on the case study of district heating networks reveals significant improvements over purely data-driven GNNs, even in the presence of noise and parameter inaccuracies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures.

However, current graph-based methodologies encounter two primary challenges: (1) Cellular Heterogeneity, where existing approaches fail to adequately address the inductive biases inherent in graphs, particularly the homophily characteristic observed in cellular connectivity and; (2) Scalability, where handling cellular graphs from high-dimensional images faces difficulties in managing a high number of cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Mew, a novel framework designed to efficiently process mIF images through the lens of multiplex network. Mew innovatively constructs a multiplex network comprising two distinct layers: a Voronoi network for geometric information and a Cell-type network for capturing cell-wise homogeneity. This framework equips a scalable and efficient Graph Neural Network (GNN), capable of processing the entire graph during training. Furthermore, Mew integrates an interpretable attention module that autonomously identifies relevant layers for image classification. Extensive experiments on a real-world patient dataset from various institutions highlight Mew's remarkable efficacy and efficiency, marking a significant advancement in mIF image analysis.

Existing GNN interpreters typically provide post-hoc explanations disjointed from GNNs' predictions, resulting in misrepresentations. Self-explainable GNNs offer built-in explanations during the training process. However, they cannot exploit the explanatory outcomes to augment prediction performance, and they fail to provide high-quality explanations of node features and require additional processes to generate explainable subgraphs, which is costly. To address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a self-explained and self-supervised graph neural network (SES) to bridge the gap between explainability and prediction. SES comprises two processes: explainable training and enhanced predictive learning. During explainable training, SES employs a global mask generator co-trained with a graph encoder and directly produces crucial structure and feature masks, reducing time consumption and providing node feature and subgraph explanations. In the enhanced predictive learning phase, mask-based positive-negative pairs are constructed utilizing the explanations to compute a triplet loss and enhance the node representations by contrastive learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[Your Graph Recommender is Provably a Single-view Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17723v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph recommender (GR) is a type of graph neural network (GNNs) encoder that is customized for extracting information from the user-item interaction graph. Due to its strong performance on the recommendation task, GR has gained significant attention recently. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is also a popular research direction that aims to learn, often unsupervised, GNNs with certain contrastive objectives. As a general graph representation learning method, GCLs have been widely adopted with the supervised recommendation loss for joint training of GRs. Despite the intersection of GR and GCL research, theoretical understanding of the relationship between the two fields is surprisingly sparse. This vacancy inevitably leads to inefficient scientific research. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the field of GR and GCL from the perspective of encoders and loss functions. With mild assumptions, we theoretically show an astonishing fact that graph recommender is equivalent to a commonly-used single-view graph contrastive model. Specifically, we find that (1) the classic encoder in GR is essentially a linear graph convolutional network with one-hot inputs, and (2) the loss function in GR is well bounded by a single-view GCL loss with certain hyperparameters. The first observation enables us to explain crucial designs of GR models, e.g., the removal of self-loop and nonlinearity. And the second finding can easily prompt many cross-field research directions. We empirically show a remarkable result that the recommendation loss and the GCL loss can be used interchangeably. The fact that we can train GR models solely with the GCL loss is particularly insightful, since before this work, GCLs were typically viewed as unsupervised methods that need fine-tuning. We also discuss some potential future works inspired by our theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware knowledge graph framework for traffic speed forecasting using graph neural network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17703v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to the lack of effective integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed using these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG's configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model surpasses benchmark models, achieving an average MAE of $3.46\pm0.01$ and a MAPE of $14.76\pm0.09\%$ for traffic speed predictions from 10 to 120 minutes. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model's ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. The CKG framework's model-agnostic nature suggests its potential applicability in various applications of intelligent transportation systems. Overall, this study underscores the importance of incorporating domain-specific contexts into traffic forecasting and merging context-aware knowledge graphs with neural networks to enhance accuracy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Systematic Reasoning About Relational Domains With Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17396v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing models that can learn to reason is a notoriously challenging problem. We focus on reasoning in relational domains, where the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) seems like a natural choice. However, previous work on reasoning with GNNs has shown that such models tend to fail when presented with test examples that require longer inference chains than those seen during training. This suggests that GNNs lack the ability to generalize from training examples in a systematic way, which would fundamentally limit their reasoning abilities. A common solution is to instead rely on neuro-symbolic methods, which are capable of reasoning in a systematic way by design. Unfortunately, the scalability of such methods is often limited and they tend to rely on overly strong assumptions, e.g.\ that queries can be answered by inspecting a single relational path. In this paper, we revisit the idea of reasoning with GNNs, showing that systematic generalization is possible as long as the right inductive bias is provided. In particular, we argue that node embeddings should be treated as epistemic states and that GNN should be parameterised accordingly. We propose a simple GNN architecture which is based on this view and show that it is capable of achieving state-of-the-art results. We furthermore introduce a benchmark which requires models to aggregate evidence from multiple relational paths. We show that existing neuro-symbolic approaches fail on this benchmark, whereas our considered GNN model learns to reason accurately.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+16...</summary><p>10+16 pages, 2+7 figures, 4+9 tables.

| **[Global and Local Confidence Based Fraud Detection Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17333v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Global and Local Confidence Graph Neural Network (GLC-GNN), an innovative approach to graph-based anomaly detection that addresses the challenges of heterophily and camouflage in fraudulent activities. By introducing a prototype to encapsulate the global features of a graph and calculating a Global Confidence (GC) value for each node, GLC-GNN effectively distinguishes between benign and fraudulent nodes. The model leverages GC to generate attention values for message aggregation, enhancing its ability to capture both homophily and heterophily. Through extensive experiments on four open datasets, GLC-GNN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models in accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining a compact model size and expedited training process. The integration of global and local confidence measures in GLC-GNN offers a robust solution for detecting anomalies in graphs, with significant implications for fraud detection across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Topological Structure Enhancers for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14324v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks).</p></details> | 10 pages |

Most commonly, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is appended to the feature extractor to facilitate end-to-end learning and downstream prediction tasks such as classification, thus representing the de facto standard. However, as graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a practicable choice for various tasks in medical research in the recent past, we direct attention to the question of how effective GNNs are compared to MLP prediction heads for the task of 3D medical image classification, proposing them as a potential alternative. In our experiments, we devise a subject-level graph for each volumetric dataset instance. Therein latent representations of all slices in the volume, encoded through a DINOv2 pretrained vision transformer (ViT), constitute the nodes and their respective node features. We use public datasets to compare the classification heads numerically and evaluate various graph construction and graph convolution methods in our experiments. Our findings show enhancements of the GNN in classification performance and substantial improvements in runtime compared to an MLP prediction head. Additional robustness evaluations further validate the promising performance of the GNN, promoting them as a suitable alternative to traditional MLP classification heads.

Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).

| **[Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and items providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raise the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve items' side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) fairnessaware attention which incorporates dot product in the normalization process of GNNs, to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees, and ii) heterophily feature weighting to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates the unfairness and popularity bias on items' side, but also achieves superior accuracy on users' side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the early detection of bots is crucial. Although there have been proposed methods for detecting bots in social media, there are still substantial limitations. For instance, existing research initiatives still extract a large number of features and train traditional machine learning algorithms or use GloVe embeddings and train LSTMs. However, feature extraction is a tedious procedure demanding domain expertise. Also, language models based on transformers have been proved to be better than LSTMs. Other approaches create large graphs and train graph neural networks requiring in this way many hours for training and access to computational resources. To tackle these limitations, this is the first study employing only the user description field and images of three channels denoting the type and content of tweets posted by the users. Firstly, we create digital DNA sequences, transform them to 3d images, and apply pretrained models of the vision domain, including EfficientNet, AlexNet, VGG16, etc. Next, we propose a multimodal approach, where we use TwHIN-BERT for getting the textual representation of the user description field and employ VGG16 for acquiring the visual representation for the image modality. We propose three different fusion methods, namely concatenation, gated multimodal unit, and crossmodal attention, for fusing the different modalities and compare their performances. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis of the behavior of our best performing model. Extensive experiments conducted on the Cresci'17 and TwiBot-20 datasets demonstrate valuable advantages of our introduced approaches over state-of-the-art ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (Accepted)</p></details> |
| **[Curriculum Negative Mining For Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17070v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks are effective in capturing the evolving interactions of networks over time, such as social networks and e-commerce networks. In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/zziyue83/CurNM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-stage Generative Question Answering on Temporal Knowledge Graph Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16568v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) poses a significant challenge task, due to the temporal constraints hidden in questions and the answers sought from dynamic structured knowledge. Although large language models (LLMs) have made considerable progress in their reasoning ability over structured data, their application to the TKGQA task is a relatively unexplored area. This paper first proposes a novel generative temporal knowledge graph question answering framework, GenTKGQA, which guides LLMs to answer temporal questions through two phases: Subgraph Retrieval and Answer Generation. First, we exploit LLM's intrinsic knowledge to mine temporal constraints and structural links in the questions without extra training, thus narrowing down the subgraph search space in both temporal and structural dimensions. Next, we design virtual knowledge indicators to fuse the graph neural network signals of the subgraph and the text representations of the LLM in a non-shallow way, which helps the open-source LLM deeply understand the temporal order and structural dependencies among the retrieved facts through instruction tuning. Experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL(Findings) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Symplectic Structure-Aware Hamiltonian (Graph) Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04885v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the assumption of a fixed embedding manifold often limits their adaptability to diverse graph geometries. Recently, Hamiltonian system-inspired GNNs have been proposed to address the dynamic nature of such embeddings by incorporating physical laws into node feature updates. We present Symplectic Structure-Aware Hamiltonian GNN (SAH-GNN), a novel approach that generalizes Hamiltonian dynamics for more flexible node feature updates. Unlike existing Hamiltonian approaches, SAH-GNN employs Riemannian optimization on the symplectic Stiefel manifold to adaptively learn the underlying symplectic structure, circumventing the limitations of existing Hamiltonian GNNs that rely on a pre-defined form of standard symplectic structure. This innovation allows SAH-GNN to automatically adapt to various graph datasets without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, it conserves energy during training meaning the implicit Hamiltonian system is physically meaningful. Finally, we empirically validate SAH-GNN's superiority and adaptability in node classification tasks across multiple types of graph datasets.</p></details> | A Note |
| **[Learning Networked Dynamical System Models with Weak Form and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16779v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that a simple approach to feature engineering - employing histogram aggregation of edge descriptors and one-hot encoding for atomic numbers and bond types - when combined with a Random Forest classifier, can establish a strong baseline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The novel algorithm, Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP), integrates Edge Betweenness Centrality, Adjusted Rand Index and SCAN Structural Similarity score. This approach proves to be remarkably competitive when compared to modern GNNs, while also being simple, fast, low-variance and hyperparameter-free. Our approach is rigorously tested on MoleculeNet datasets using fair evaluation protocol provided by Open Graph Benchmark. We additionally show out-of-domain generation capabilities on peptide classification task from Long Range Graph Benchmark. The evaluations across eleven benchmark datasets reveal MOLTOP's strong discriminative capabilities, surpassing the $1$-WL test and even $3$-WL test for some classes of graphs. Our conclusion is that descriptor-based baselines, such as the one we propose, are still crucial for accurately assessing advancements in the GNN domain.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while improving inference speed up to 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our tested benchmarks. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches either overlook the inherent permutation symmetry in the neural network or rely on intricate weight-sharing patterns to achieve equivariance, while ignoring the impact of the network architecture itself. In this work, we propose to represent neural networks as computational graphs of parameters, which allows us to harness powerful graph neural networks and transformers that preserve permutation symmetry. Consequently, our approach enables a single model to encode neural computational graphs with diverse architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of tasks, including classification and editing of implicit neural representations, predicting generalization performance, and learning to optimize, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

The dataset comprises 1,410 videos totaling nearly 24 hours and includes performances from 11 signers. Turkish, an agglutinative language, poses unique challenges for sign language translation, particularly with a vocabulary where 64% are singleton words and 85% are rare words, appearing less than five times. We developed two baseline models to address these challenges: the Pose to Text Transformer (P2T-T) and the Graph Neural Network based Transformer (GNN-T) models. The GNN-T model achieved 19.13% BLEU-1 score and 3.28% BLEU-4 score, presenting a significant challenge compared to existing benchmarks. The P2T-T model, while demonstrating slightly lower performance in BLEU scores, achieved a higher ROUGE-L score of 22.09%.

Recently, researchers have proposed using unsupervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, which can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. GNNs have demonstrated high performance with nearly linear scalability and significantly outperformed classic heuristic-based algorithms in terms of computational efficiency on large-scale problems. However, when utilizing standard node features, GNNs tend to get trapped to suboptimal local minima of the energy landscape, resulting in low quality solutions. We introduce a novel algorithm, denoted hereafter as QRF-GNN, leveraging the power of GNNs to efficiently solve CO problems with QUBO formulation. It relies on unsupervised learning by minimizing the loss function derived from QUBO relaxation. The proposed key components of the architecture include the recurrent use of intermediate GNN predictions, parallel convolutional layers and combination of static node features as input. Altogether, it helps to adapt the intermediate solution candidate to minimize QUBO-based loss function, taking into account not only static graph features, but also intermediate predictions treated as dynamic, i.e. iteratively changing recurrent features. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on the canonical benchmark datasets for maximum cut, graph coloring and maximum independent set problems. Results of experiments show that QRF-GNN drastically surpasses existing learning-based approaches and is comparable to the state-of-the-art conventional heuristics, improving their scalability on large instances.</p></details> |  |

Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in representation learning on graphs, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, GNNs have several drawbacks such as lacking interpretability, can easily inherit the bias of data and cannot model casual relations. Recently, counterfactual learning on graphs has shown promising results in alleviating these drawbacks. Various approaches have been proposed for counterfactual fairness, explainability, link prediction and other applications on graphs. To facilitate the development of this promising direction, in this survey, we categorize and comprehensively review papers on graph counterfactual learning. We divide existing methods into four categories based on problems studied. For each category, we provide background and motivating examples, a general framework summarizing existing works and a detailed review of these works. We point out promising future research directions at the intersection of graph-structured data, counterfactual learning, and real-world applications. To offer a comprehensive view of resources for future studies, we compile a collection of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. This survey aims to serve as a ``one-stop-shop'' for building a unified understanding of graph counterfactual learning categories and current resources.

Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time.

Most existing deep-learning methods consider a protein as a 3D image by spatially clustering its atoms into voxels and then feed the voxelized protein into a 3D CNN for prediction. However, the CNN-based methods encounter several critical issues: 1) defective in representing irregular protein structures; 2) sensitive to rotations; 3) insufficient to characterize the protein surface; 4) unaware of protein size shift. To address the above issues, this work proposes EquiPocket, an E(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binding site prediction, which comprises three modules: the first one to extract local geometric information for each surface atom, the second one to model both the chemical and spatial structure of protein and the last one to capture the geometry of the surface via equivariant message passing over the surface atoms. We further propose a dense attention output layer to alleviate the effect incurred by variable protein size.

Despite the popularity, a notable discrepancy remains between user expectations regarding the remaining battery range of SEBs and the reality, leading to a pronounced inclination among users to find an available SEB during emergency situations. In response to this challenge, the integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and battery-swap services has surfaced as a viable solution. In this paper, we propose a novel structural Transformer-based model, referred to as the SEB-Transformer, designed specifically for predicting the battery range of SEBs. The scenario is conceptualized as a dynamic heterogeneous graph that encapsulates the interactions between users and bicycles, providing a comprehensive framework for analysis. Furthermore, we incorporate the graph structure into the SEB-Transformer to facilitate the estimation of the remaining e-bike battery range, in conjunction with mean structural similarity, enhancing the prediction accuracy. By employing the predictions made by our model, we are able to dynamically adjust the optimal cycling routes for users in real-time, while also considering the strategic locations of charging stations, thereby optimizing the user experience. Empirically our results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model against nine competitive baselines. These innovations, powered by AIoT, not only bridge the gap between user expectations and the physical limitations of battery range but also significantly improve the operational efficiency and sustainability of SEB services. Through these advancements, the shared electric bicycle ecosystem is evolving, making strides towards a more reliable, user-friendly, and sustainable mode of transportation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9page...</summary><p>9pages, 6figures, accepted by IEEE ICWS 2024 The International Conference on Web Services</p></details> |
| **[Link Polarity Prediction from Sparse and Noisy Labels via Multiscale Social Balance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15643v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have recently gained attention as an effective tool for several learning tasks on signed networks, i.e., graphs where edges have an associated polarity. One of these tasks is to predict the polarity of the links for which this information is missing, starting from the network structure and the other available polarities. However, when the available polarities are few and potentially noisy, such a task becomes challenging. In this work, we devise a semi-supervised learning framework that builds around the novel concept of \emph{multiscale social balance} to improve the prediction of link polarities in settings characterized by limited data quantity and quality. Our model-agnostic approach can seamlessly integrate with any SGNN architecture, dynamically reweighting the importance of each data sample while making strategic use of the structural information from unlabeled edges combined with social balance theory. Empirical validation demonstrates that our approach outperforms established baseline models, effectively addressing the limitations imposed by noisy and sparse data. This result underlines the benefits of incorporating multiscale social balance into SGNNs, opening new avenues for robust and accurate predictions in signed network analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Condensation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11720v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of graph data poses significant challenges in storage, transmission, and particularly the training of graph neural networks (GNNs). To address these challenges, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as an innovative solution. GC focuses on synthesizing a compact yet highly representative graph, enabling GNNs trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large graph. The notable efficacy of GC and its broad prospects have garnered significant attention and spurred extensive research. This survey paper provides an up-to-date and systematic overview of GC, organizing existing research into five categories aligned with critical GC evaluation criteria: effectiveness, generalization, efficiency, fairness, and robustness. To facilitate an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of GC, this paper examines various methods under each category and thoroughly discusses two essential components within GC: optimization strategies and condensed graph generation. We also empirically compare and analyze representative GC methods with diverse optimization strategies based on the five proposed GC evaluation criteria. Finally, we explore the applications of GC in various fields, outline the related open-source libraries, and highlight the present challenges and novel insights, with the aim of promoting advancements in future research.

Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques have built upon these developments. However, most studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to incorporate risky firms and use all the firms in portfolio optimisation. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional features and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them particularly appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimization. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model that we train using custom layers which impose weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus directly maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period while also being informative of market dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 7 figures, v1</p></details> |
| **[GraphScale: A Framework to Enable Machine Learning over Billion-node Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15452v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for supervised machine learning over graph-structured data, while sampling-based node representation learning is widely utilized in unsupervised learning. However, scalability remains a major challenge in both supervised and unsupervised learning for large graphs (e.g., those with over 1 billion nodes). The scalability bottleneck largely stems from the mini-batch sampling phase in GNNs and the random walk sampling phase in unsupervised methods. These processes often require storing features or embeddings in memory. In the context of distributed training, they require frequent, inefficient random access to data stored across different workers. Such repeated inter-worker communication for each mini-batch leads to high communication overhead and computational inefficiency. We propose GraphScale, a unified framework for both supervised and unsupervised learning to store and process large graph data distributedly. The key insight in our design is the separation of workers who store data and those who perform the training. This separation allows us to decouple computing and storage in graph training, thus effectively building a pipeline where data fetching and data computation can overlap asynchronously. Our experiments show that GraphScale outperforms state-of-the-art methods for distributed training of both GNNs and node embeddings. We evaluate GraphScale both on public and proprietary graph datasets and observe a reduction of at least 40% in end-to-end training times compared to popular distributed frameworks, without any loss in performance. While most existing methods don't support billion-node graphs for training node embeddings, GraphScale is currently deployed in production at TikTok enabling efficient learning over such large graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2024), 8 Pages, 12 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Pre-Training and Prompting for Few-Shot Node Classification on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15431v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The text-attributed graph (TAG) is one kind of important real-world graph-structured data with each node associated with raw texts. For TAGs, traditional few-shot node classification methods directly conduct training on the pre-processed node features and do not consider the raw texts. The performance is highly dependent on the choice of the feature pre-processing method. In this paper, we propose P2TAG, a framework designed for few-shot node classification on TAGs with graph pre-training and prompting. P2TAG first pre-trains the language model (LM) and graph neural network (GNN) on TAGs with self-supervised loss. To fully utilize the ability of language models, we adapt the masked language modeling objective for our framework. The pre-trained model is then used for the few-shot node classification with a mixed prompt method, which simultaneously considers both text and graph information. We conduct experiments on six real-world TAGs, including paper citation networks and product co-purchasing networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing graph few-shot learning methods on these datasets with +18.98% ~ +35.98% improvements.</p></details> | Accepted to KDD'24 |

Our analysis reveals conceptual flaws within certain benchmark GNN models when operating under the assumption of edge-independent node labels, a condition commonly observed in benchmark graphs employed for node classification. Approaching neighborhood aggregation from a statistical signal processing perspective, our investigation provides novel insights which may be used to design more efficient GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSM-GNN: Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN Training by Optimizing Data Transfer Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15264v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used today in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and node/link classification tasks. Real world GNNs continue to scale in size and require a large memory footprint for storing graphs and embeddings that often exceed the memory capacities of the target GPUs used for training. To address limited memory capacities, traditional GNN training approaches use graph partitioning and sharding techniques to scale up across multiple GPUs within a node and/or scale out across multiple nodes. However, this approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning algorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs. To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that utilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function as a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid eviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and dynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance. Furthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a mechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU pinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices. Experimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and memory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior performance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x speed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[All Against Some: Efficient Integration of Large Language Models for Message Passing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14996v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted immense attention in the past decade due to their numerous real-world applications built around graph-structured data. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) with extensive pretrained knowledge and powerful semantic comprehension abilities have recently shown a remarkable ability to benefit applications using vision and text data. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged in a computationally efficient fashion to benefit rich graph-structured data, a modality relatively unexplored in LLM literature. Prior works in this area exploit LLMs to augment every node features in an ad-hoc fashion (not scalable for large graphs), use natural language to describe the complex structural information of graphs, or perform computationally expensive finetuning of LLMs in conjunction with GNNs. We propose E-LLaGNN (Efficient LLMs augmented GNNs), a framework with an on-demand LLM service that enriches message passing procedure of graph learning by enhancing a limited fraction of nodes from the graph. More specifically, E-LLaGNN relies on sampling high-quality neighborhoods using LLMs, followed by on-demand neighborhood feature enhancement using diverse prompts from our prompt catalog, and finally information aggregation using message passing from conventional GNN architectures. We explore several heuristics-based active node selection strategies to limit the computational and memory footprint of LLMs when handling millions of nodes. Through extensive experiments & ablation on popular graph benchmarks of varying scales (Cora, PubMed, ArXiv, & Products), we illustrate the effectiveness of our E-LLaGNN framework and reveal many interesting capabilities such as improved gradient flow in deep GNNs, LLM-free inference ability etc.</p></details> |  |

This data presents significant challenges due to its volume and complex reconstruction, necessitating the use of advanced analysis techniques for analysis. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks, have shown promising results in addressing the challenges but remain computationally expensive. The study presented in this paper uses a simulated particle collision dataset to integrate influence analysis inside the graph classification pipeline aiming at improving the accuracy and efficiency of collision event prediction tasks. By using a Graph Neural Network for initial training, we applied a gradient-based data influence method to identify influential training samples and then we refined the dataset by removing non-contributory elements: the model trained on this new reduced dataset can achieve good performances at a reduced computational cost. The method is completely agnostic to the specific influence method: different influence modalities can be easily integrated into our methodology. Moreover, by analyzing the discarded elements we can provide further insights about the event classification task. The novelty of integrating data attribution techniques together with Graph Neural Networks in high-energy physics tasks can offer a robust solution for managing large-scale data problems, capturing critical patterns, and maximizing accuracy across several high-data demand domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

GSN employs k-means clustering to group graph nodes into clusters, facilitating the creation of subgraphs. These subgraphs are then utilized to learn representative `atoms` for dictionary learning, enabling the identification of sparse, class-distinguishable features. This integrated approach is particularly relevant in domains like medical imaging, where discerning subtle feature differences is crucial for accurate classification. To evaluate the performance of our proposed GSN, we conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, including PascalVOC and HAM10000. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our model in optimizing dictionary configurations across varied classes, which contributes to its effectiveness in medical classification tasks. This performance enhancement is primarily attributed to the integration of CNNs, GNNs, and graph learning techniques, which collectively improve the handling of datasets with limited labeled examples. Specifically, our experiments show that the model achieves a higher accuracy on benchmark datasets such as Pascal VOC and HAM10000 compared to conventional CNN approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in AI model accuracy, there is still a significant need among domain experts for interpretive paths and mechanism explorations that align better with domain-specific knowledge, particularly due to the high costs of experimentation. To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework with two key components: 1) Human-Engaged Knowledge Graph Refinement based on Metapath Strategies, which leverages insights from interpretive paths and domain expertise to refine the knowledge graph through metapath strategies with appropriate granularity. 2) Cross-Granularity SL Interpretation Enhancement and Mechanism Analysis, which aids experts in organizing and comparing predictions and interpretive paths across different granularities, uncovering new SL relationships, enhancing result interpretation, and elucidating potential mechanisms inferred by Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. These components cyclically optimize model predictions and mechanism explorations, enhancing expert involvement and intervention to build trust. Facilitated by SLInterpreter, this framework ensures that newly generated interpretive paths increasingly align with domain knowledge and adhere more closely to real-world biological principles through iterative Human-AI collaboration. We evaluate the framework's efficacy through a case study and expert interviews.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teach Harder, Learn Poorer: Rethinking Hard Sample Distillation for GNN-to-MLP Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14768v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the gaps between powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs), GNN-to-MLP Knowledge Distillation (KD) proposes to distill knowledge from a well-trained teacher GNN into a student MLP. In this paper, we revisit the knowledge samples (nodes) in teacher GNNs from the perspective of hardness, and identify that hard sample distillation may be a major performance bottleneck of existing graph KD algorithms. The GNN-to-MLP KD involves two different types of hardness, one student-free knowledge hardness describing the inherent complexity of GNN knowledge, and the other student-dependent distillation hardness describing the difficulty of teacher-to-student distillation. However, most of the existing work focuses on only one of these aspects or regards them as one thing. This paper proposes a simple yet effective Hardness-aware GNN-to-MLP Distillation (HGMD) framework, which decouples the two hardnesses and estimates them using a non-parametric approach. Finally, two hardness-aware distillation schemes (i.e., HGMD-weight and HGMD-mixup) are further proposed to distill hardness-aware knowledge from teacher GNNs into the corresponding nodes of student MLPs. As non-parametric distillation, HGMD does not involve any additional learnable parameters beyond the student MLPs, but it still outperforms most of the state-of-the-art competitors. HGMD-mixup improves over the vanilla MLPs by 12.95% and outperforms its teacher GNNs by 2.48% averaged over seven real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Achieving high-quality graph representation is important for identifying linked patterns, leading to improvements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to better capture data structures. However, challenges such as data scarcity, high collection costs, and ethical concerns limit progress. As a result, generative models and data augmentation have become more and more popular. This study explores using generated graphs for data augmentation, comparing the performance of combining generated graphs with real graphs, and examining the effect of different quantities of generated graphs on graph classification tasks. The experiments show that balancing scalability and quality requires different generators based on graph size. Our results introduce a new approach to graph data augmentation, ensuring consistent labels and enhancing classification performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperdimensional Computing for Node Classification and Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17073v2)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method for transductive learning on graphs using hyperdimensional representations. The proposed approach encodes data samples using random projections into a very high-dimensional space (hyperdimensional or HD space for short). It obviates the need for expensive iterative training of the sort required by deep learning methods. Specifically, we propose a Hyperdimensional Graph Learning (HDGL) algorithm. HDGL leverages the \emph{injectivity} property of node representations of a family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to map node features to the HD space and then uses HD operators such as bundling and binding to aggregate information from the local neighborhood of each node. The resulting latent node representations support both node classification and link prediction tasks, unlike typical deep learning methods, which often require separate models for these tasks. We report results of experiments using widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrate that, on the node classification task, HDGL is competitive with the SOTA GNN methods with respect to accuracy, at substantially reduced computational cost. Furthermore, HDGL is well-suited for class incremental learning where the model has to learn to effectively discriminate between a growing number of classes. Our experiments also show that the HD representation constructed by HDGL supports link prediction at accuracies comparable to that of DeepWalk and related methods, although it falls short of SOTA Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods that rely on computationally expensive iterative training. We conclude that HDGL offers a computationally efficient alternative to graph neural networks for node classification, especially in settings that call for class-incremental learning or in applications that demand high accuracy models at significantly lower computational cost and learning time than possible with the SOTA GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANDA: Expanded Width-Aware Message Passing Beyond Rewiring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03671v2)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in the field of graph neural network (GNN) has identified a critical issue known as "over-squashing," resulting from the bottleneck phenomenon in graph structures, which impedes the propagation of long-range information. Prior works have proposed a variety of graph rewiring concepts that aim at optimizing the spatial or spectral properties of graphs to promote the signal propagation. However, such approaches inevitably deteriorate the original graph topology, which may lead to a distortion of information flow. To address this, we introduce an expanded width-aware (PANDA) message passing, a new message passing paradigm where nodes with high centrality, a potential source of over-squashing, are selectively expanded in width to encapsulate the growing influx of signals from distant nodes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing rewiring methods, suggesting that selectively expanding the hidden state of nodes can be a compelling alternative to graph rewiring for addressing the over-squashing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |

However, many models typically obtain unsatisfactory performance when applied to few-shot scenarios. Some studies have attempted to combine meta-learning with graph neural networks to solve few-shot node classification on graphs. Despite their promising performance, some limitations remain. First, they employ the node encoding mechanism of homophilic graphs to learn node embeddings, even in heterophilic graphs. Second, existing models based on meta-learning ignore the interference of randomness in the learning process. Third, they are trained using only limited labeled nodes within the specific task, without explicitly utilizing numerous unlabeled nodes. Finally, they treat almost all sampled tasks equally without customizing them for their uniqueness. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for few-shot node classification called Meta-GPS++. Specifically, we first adopt an efficient method to learn discriminative node representations on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Then, we leverage a prototype-based approach to initialize parameters and contrastive learning for regularizing the distribution of node embeddings. Moreover, we apply self-training to extract valuable information from unlabeled nodes. Additionally, we adopt S$^2$ (scaling & shifting) transformation to learn transferable knowledge from diverse tasks. The results on real-world datasets show the superiority of Meta-GPS++.

However, many current methods focus on employing shared polynomial coefficients for all nodes, i.e., learning node-unified filters, which limits the filters' flexibility for node-level tasks. The recent DSF attempts to overcome this limitation by learning node-wise coefficients based on positional encoding. However, the initialization and updating process of the positional encoding are burdensome, hindering scalability on large-scale graphs. In this work, we propose a scalable node-wise filter, PolyAttn. Leveraging the attention mechanism, PolyAttn can directly learn node-wise filters in an efficient manner, offering powerful representation capabilities. Building on PolyAttn, we introduce the whole model, named PolyFormer. In the lens of Graph Transformer models, PolyFormer, which calculates attention scores within nodes, shows great scalability. Moreover, the model captures spectral information, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining efficiency. With these advantages, PolyFormer offers a desirable balance between scalability and expressiveness for node-level tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods excel at learning arbitrary node-wise filters, showing superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, and handling graphs containing up to 100 million nodes.

Towards this research line, graph contrastive learning (GCL) demonstrates robust capabilities to address the supervision label shortage issue through generating massive self-supervised signals. Despite its effectiveness, GCL for recommendation suffers seriously from two main challenges: i) GCL relies on graph augmentation to generate semantically different views for contrasting, which could potentially disrupt key information and introduce unwanted noise; ii) current works for GCL primarily focus on contrasting representations using sophisticated networks architecture (usually deep) to capture high-order interactions, which leads to increased computational complexity and suboptimal training efficiency. To this end, we propose L2CL, a principled Layer-to-Layer Contrastive Learning framework that contrasts representations from different layers. By aligning the semantic similarities between different layers, L2CL enables the learning of complex structural relationships and gets rid of the noise perturbation in stochastic data augmentation. Surprisingly, we find that L2CL, using only one-hop contrastive learning paradigm, is able to capture intrinsic semantic structures and improve the quality of node representation, leading to a simple yet effective architecture. We also provide theoretical guarantees for L2CL in minimizing task-irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over various state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods.

Indeed, a wide number of DLWP architectures -- based on various backbones, including U-Net, Transformer, Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) -- have demonstrated their potential at forecasting atmospheric states. However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. In terms of accuracy, memory consumption, and runtime, our results illustrate various tradeoffs. For example, on synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO; and on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 365 days, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO. In addition, we observe that all of these model backbones ``saturate,'' i.e., none of them exhibit so-called neural scaling, which highlights an important direction for future work on these and related models.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, as the evolution of cancers is a continuous process, the correlations and differences across various stages, anatomical locations and patients should be taken into account. However, recent research mainly focuses on the inner-contextual information in a single WSI, ignoring the correlations between slides. To verify whether introducing the slide inter-correlations can bring improvements to WSI representation learning, we propose a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that considers the existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods as the backbone and forge the WSI classification task as a node classification problem. More specifically, SlideGCD declares a node buffer that stores previous slide embeddings for subsequent extensive slide-based graph construction and conducts graph learning to explore the inter-correlations implied in the slide-based graph. Moreover, we frame the MIL classifier and graph learning into two parallel workflows and deploy the knowledge distillation to transfer the differentiable information to the graph neural network. The consistent performance boosting, brought by SlideGCD, of four previous state-of-the-art MIL methods is observed on two TCGA benchmark datasets.

Node classification, a fundamental task in this context, is typically tackled using graph neural networks (GNNs). Unfortunately, conventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes, despite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer learning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to exploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based methods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the quality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm to enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with considerably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 Figures |
| **[EggNet: An Evolving Graph-based Graph Attention Network for Particle Track Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13925v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Track reconstruction is a crucial task in particle experiments and is traditionally very computationally expensive due to its combinatorial nature. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach that can improve scalability. Most of these GNN-based methods, including the edge classification (EC) and the object condensation (OC) approach, require an input graph that needs to be constructed beforehand. In this work, we consider a one-shot OC approach that reconstructs particle tracks directly from a set of hits (point cloud) by recursively applying graph attention networks with an evolving graph structure. This approach iteratively updates the graphs and can better facilitate the message passing across each graph. Preliminary studies on the TrackML dataset show better track performance compared to the methods that require a fixed input graph.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Conformalized Link Prediction on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18763v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in diverse tasks, yet their applications in high-stakes domains are often hampered by unreliable predictions. Although numerous uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often lack \textit{rigorous} uncertainty estimates. This work makes the first attempt to introduce a distribution-free and model-agnostic uncertainty quantification approach to construct a predictive interval with a statistical guarantee for GNN-based link prediction. We term it as \textit{conformalized link prediction.} Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals. We first theoretically and empirically establish a permutation invariance condition for the application of CP in link prediction tasks, along with an exact test-time coverage. Leveraging the important structural information in graphs, we then identify a novel and crucial connection between a graph's adherence to the power law distribution and the efficiency of CP. This insight leads to the development of a simple yet effective sampling-based method to align the graph structure with a power law distribution prior to the standard CP procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that for conformalized link prediction, our approach achieves the desired marginal coverage while significantly improving the efficiency of CP compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Malware Detection with Adversarial Domain Adaptation and Control Flow Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13918v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the application of deep learning for malware classification, it is crucial to account for the prevalence of malware evolution, which can cause trained classifiers to fail on drifted malware. Existing solutions to combat concept drift use active learning: they select new samples for analysts to label, and then retrain the classifier with the new labels. Our key finding is, the current retraining techniques do not achieve optimal results. These models overlook that updating the model with scarce drifted samples requires learning features that remain consistent across pre-drift and post-drift data. Furthermore, the model should be capable of disregarding specific features that, while beneficial for classification of pre-drift data, are absent in post-drift data, thereby preventing prediction degradation. In this paper, we propose a method that learns retained information in malware control flow graphs post-drift by leveraging graph neural network with adversarial domain adaptation. Our approach considers drift-invariant features within assembly instructions and flow of code execution. We further propose building blocks for more robust evaluation of drift adaptation techniques that computes statistically distant malware clusters. Our approach is compared with the previously published training methods in active learning systems, and the other domain adaptation technique. Our approach demonstrates a significant enhancement in predicting unseen malware family in a binary classification task and predicting drifted malware families in a multi-class setting. In addition, we assess alternative malware representations. The best results are obtained when our adaptation method is applied to our graph representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temperature Distribution Prediction in Laser Powder Bed Fusion using Transferable and Scalable Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13838v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents novel predictive models using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for simulating thermal dynamics in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) processes. By developing and validating Single-Laser GNN (SL-GNN) and Multi-Laser GNN (ML-GNN) surrogates, the research introduces a scalable data-driven approach that learns fundamental physics from small-scale Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations and applies them to larger domains. Achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.77% with the baseline SL-GNN model, GNNs effectively learn from high-resolution simulations and generalize well across larger geometries. The proposed models capture the complexity of the heat transfer process in L-PBF while significantly reducing computational costs. For example, a thermomechanical simulation for a 2 mm x 2 mm domain typically requires about 4 hours, whereas the SL-GNN model can predict thermal distributions almost instantly. Calibrating models to larger domains enhances predictive performance, with significant drops in MAPE for 3 mm x 3 mm and 4 mm x 4 mm domains, highlighting the scalability and efficiency of this approach. Additionally, models show a decreasing trend in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) when tuned to larger domains, suggesting potential for becoming geometry-agnostic. The interaction of multiple lasers complicates heat transfer, necessitating larger model architectures and advanced feature engineering. Using hyperparameters from Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization, the best ML-GNN model demonstrates a 46.4% improvement in MAPE over the baseline ML-GNN model. In summary, this approach enables more efficient and flexible predictive modeling in L-PBF additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.
