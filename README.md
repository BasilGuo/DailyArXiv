| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Interconnections between Corruption and Economic Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08132v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the dynamic relationship between corruption and economic growth through an approach based on a system of stochastic equations. In the context of globalization and economic interdependencies, corruption not only affects investment and distorts markets, but it can also, under certain conditions, temporarily boost economic activity. Using data from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), we implement a time-series-based model to capture the interactions between these two variables. Through a coupled vector autoregressive equations system, our model identifies patterns of interdependence between economic fluctuations and perceptions of corruption at a global level. Employing graph theory and Granger causality, we build a network of interconnections that illustrates how corruption dynamics in one country can influence economic growth and corruption perception in others. The results provide a robust tool for analyzing international political-economic relationships and can serve as a basis for designing policies that promote transparency and sustainable development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Euclidean mirrors and first-order changepoints in network time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11111v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a model for a network time series whose evolution is governed by an underlying stochastic process, known as the latent position process, in which network evolution can be represented in Euclidean space by a curve, called the Euclidean mirror. We define the notion of a first-order changepoint for a time series of networks, and construct a family of latent position process networks with underlying first-order changepoints. We prove that a spectral estimate of the associated Euclidean mirror localizes these changepoints, even when the graph distribution evolves continuously, but at a rate that changes. Simulated and real data examples on organoid networks show that this localization captures empirically significant shifts in network evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up Your Kernels: Large Kernel Design in ConvNets towards Universal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08049v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes the paradigm of large convolutional kernels in designing modern Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We establish that employing a few large kernels, instead of stacking multiple smaller ones, can be a superior design strategy. Our work introduces a set of architecture design guidelines for large-kernel ConvNets that optimize their efficiency and performance. We propose the UniRepLKNet architecture, which offers systematical architecture design principles specifically crafted for large-kernel ConvNets, emphasizing their unique ability to capture extensive spatial information without deep layer stacking. This results in a model that not only surpasses its predecessors with an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, an ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and a COCO box AP of 56.4% but also demonstrates impressive scalability and performance on various modalities such as time-series forecasting, audio, point cloud, and video recognition. These results indicate the universal modeling abilities of large-kernel ConvNets with faster inference speed compared with vision transformers. Our findings reveal that large-kernel ConvNets possess larger effective receptive fields and a higher shape bias, moving away from the texture bias typical of smaller-kernel CNNs. All codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/AILab-CVC/UniRepLKNet promoting further research and development in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the journal version of arXiv:2203.06717 and arXiv:2311.15599</p></details> |
| **[MOMENT: A Family of Open Time-series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03885v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time series analysis. Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML'24.

| **[On the Convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent for Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08041v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), a recently proposed neural network architecture, have gained significant attention in the deep learning community, due to their potential as a viable alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and their broad applicability to various scientific tasks. Empirical investigations demonstrate that KANs optimized via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are capable of achieving near-zero training loss in various machine learning (e.g., regression, classification, and time series forecasting, etc.) and scientific tasks (e.g., solving partial differential equations). In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical success by conducting a rigorous convergence analysis of gradient descent (GD) and SGD for two-layer KANs in solving both regression and physics-informed tasks. For regression problems, we establish using the neural tangent kernel perspective that GD achieves global linear convergence of the objective function when the hidden dimension of KANs is sufficiently large. We further extend these results to SGD, demonstrating a similar global convergence in expectation. Additionally, we analyze the global convergence of GD and SGD for physics-informed KANs, which unveils additional challenges due to the more complex loss structure. This is the first work establishing the global convergence guarantees for GD and SGD applied to optimize KANs and physics-informed KANs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSS: Co-optimizing Sensor and Sampling Rate for Data-Efficient AI in Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05426v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Artificial Neural Networks have significantly improved human activity recognition using multiple time-series sensors. While employing numerous sensors with high-frequency sampling rates usually improves the results, it often leads to data inefficiency and unnecessary expansion of the ANN, posing a challenge for their practical deployment on edge devices. Addressing these issues, our work introduces a pragmatic framework for data-efficient utilization in HAR tasks, considering the optimization of both sensor modalities and sampling rate simultaneously. Central to our approach are the designed trainable parameters, termed 'Weight Scores,' which assess the significance of each sensor modality and sampling rate during the training phase. These scores guide the sensor modalities and sampling rate selection. The pruning method allows users to make a trade-off between computational budgets and performance by selecting the sensor modalities and sampling rates according to the weight score ranking. We tested our framework's effectiveness in optimizing sensor modality and sampling rate selection using three public HAR benchmark datasets. The results show that the sensor and sampling rate combination selected via CoSS achieves similar classification performance to configurations using the highest sampling rate with all sensors but at a reduced hardware cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted by the 2nd Workshop on Sustainable AI (AAAI24)</p></details> |
| **[HierarchicalForecast: A Reference Framework for Hierarchical Forecasting in Python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03517v6)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large collections of time series data are commonly organized into structures with different levels of aggregation; examples include product and geographical groupings. It is often important to ensure that the forecasts are coherent so that the predicted values at disaggregate levels add up to the aggregate forecast. The growing interest of the Machine Learning community in hierarchical forecasting systems indicates that we are in a propitious moment to ensure that scientific endeavors are grounded on sound baselines. For this reason, we put forward the HierarchicalForecast library, which contains preprocessed publicly available datasets, evaluation metrics, and a compiled set of statistical baseline models. Our Python-based reference framework aims to bridge the gap between statistical and econometric modeling, and Machine Learning forecasting research. Code and documentation are available in https://github.com/Nixtla/hierarchicalforecast.</p></details> |  |
| **[panelPomp: Analysis of Panel Data via Partially Observed Markov Processes in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07934v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panel data arise when time series measurements are collected from multiple, dynamically independent but structurally related systems. In such cases, each system's time series can be modeled as a partially observed Markov process (POMP), and the ensemble of these models is called a PanelPOMP. If the time series are relatively short, statistical inference for each time series must draw information from across the entire panel. Every time series has a name, called its unit label, which may correspond to an object on which that time series was collected. Differences between units may be of direct inferential interest or may be a nuisance for studying the commonalities. The R package panelPomp supports analysis of panel data via a general class of PanelPOMP models. This includes a suite of tools for manipulation of models and data that take advantage of the panel structure. The panelPomp package currently emphasizes recent advances enabling likelihood-based inference via simulation-based algorithms. However, the general framework provided by panelPomp supports development of additional, new inference methodology for panel data.</p></details> |  |

With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning to evaluate predictions. This enables the model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By integrating selected news events with time series data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Task-oriented Time Series Imputation Evaluation via Generalized Representers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06652v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is widely used in many fields such as power energy, economics, and transportation, including different tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. Missing values are widely observed in these tasks, and often leading to unpredictable negative effects on existing methods, hindering their further application. In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Counterfactual Interpretability in Deep Learning Models for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12666v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popularity of deep learning methods in the time series domain boosts interest in interpretability studies, including counterfactual (CF) methods. CF methods identify minimal changes in instances to alter the model predictions. Despite extensive research, no existing work benchmarks CF methods in the time series domain. Additionally, the results reported in the literature are inconclusive due to the limited number of datasets and inadequate metrics. In this work, we redesign quantitative metrics to accurately capture desirable characteristics in CFs. We specifically redesign the metrics for sparsity and plausibility and introduce a new metric for consistency. Combined with validity, generation time, and proximity, we form a comprehensive metric set. We systematically benchmark 6 different CF methods on 20 univariate datasets and 10 multivariate datasets with 3 different classifiers. Results indicate that the performance of CF methods varies across metrics and among different models. Finally, we provide case studies and a guideline for practical usage.</p></details> | 15 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07550v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow. The proposed method leverages the (conditional) optimal transport theory to learn the probability flow in a simulation-free manner, in which the initial noise, missing data, and observations are treated as the source distribution, target distribution, and conditional information, respectively. According to the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to incorporate more prior information into the model, we parameterize the derivative of a task-specific potential function via a variational autoencoder, and combine it with the base estimator to formulate a Rao-Blackwellized sampler. The propose model allows us to take less intermediate steps to produce high-quality samples for inference compared to existing diffusion methods. Finally, the experimental results on the real-word datasets show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on time series imputation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05218v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rank Supervised Contrastive Learning for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18057v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various contrastive learning techniques have been developed to categorize time series data and exhibit promising performance. A general paradigm is to utilize appropriate augmentations and construct feasible positive samples such that the encoder can yield robust and discriminative representations by mapping similar data points closer together in the feature space while pushing dissimilar data points farther apart. Despite its efficacy, the fine-grained relative similarity (e.g., rank) information of positive samples is largely ignored, especially when labeled samples are limited. To this end, we present Rank Supervised Contrastive Learning (RankSCL) to perform time series classification. Different from conventional contrastive learning frameworks, RankSCL augments raw data in a targeted way in the embedding space and adopts certain filtering rules to select more informative positive and negative pairs of samples. Moreover, a novel rank loss is developed to assign different weights for different levels of positive samples, enable the encoder to extract the fine-grained information of the same class, and produce a clear boundary among different classes. Thoroughly empirical studies on 128 UCR datasets and 30 UEA datasets demonstrate that the proposed RankSCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[The FIX Benchmark: Extracting Features Interpretable to eXperts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13684v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based methods are commonly used to explain model predictions, but these methods often implicitly assume that interpretable features are readily available. However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalisable Time Series Understanding Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07299v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In natural language processing and computer vision, self-supervised pre-training on large datasets unlocks foundational model capabilities across domains and tasks. However, this potential has not yet been realised in time series analysis, where existing methods disregard the heterogeneous nature of time series characteristics. Time series are prevalent in many domains, including medicine, engineering, natural sciences, and finance, but their characteristics vary significantly in terms of variate count, inter-variate relationships, temporal dynamics, and sampling frequency. This inherent heterogeneity across domains prevents effective pre-training on large time series corpora. To address this issue, we introduce OTiS, an open model for general time series analysis, that has been specifically designed to handle multi-domain heterogeneity. We propose a novel pre-training paradigm including a tokeniser with learnable domain-specific signatures, a dual masking strategy to capture temporal causality, and a normalised cross-correlation loss to model long-range dependencies. Our model is pre-trained on a large corpus of 640,187 samples and 11 billion time points spanning 8 distinct domains, enabling it to analyse time series from any (unseen) domain. In comprehensive experiments across 15 diverse applications - including classification, regression, and forecasting - OTiS showcases its ability to accurately capture domain-specific data characteristics and demonstrates its competitiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/oetu/otis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Population Transformer: Learning Population-level Representations of Neural Activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03044v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for arbitrary ensembles of neural recordings at scale. We address two key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data: sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained representations and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight and more interpretable, while still retaining competitive performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained PopT and fine-tuned models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from massive amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Feature-centric nonlinear autoregressive models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07293v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel feature-centric approach to surrogate modeling of dynamical systems driven by time-varying exogenous excitations. This approach, named Functional Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (F-NARX), aims to approximate the system response based on temporal features of both the exogenous inputs and the system response, rather than on their values at specific time lags. This is a major step away from the discrete-time-centric approach of classical NARX models, which attempts to determine the relationship between selected time steps of the input/output time series. By modeling the system in a time-feature space instead of the original time axis, F-NARX can provide more stable long-term predictions and drastically reduce the reliance of the model performance on the time discretization of the problem. F-NARX, like NARX, acts as a framework and is not tied to a single implementation. In this work, we introduce an F-NARX implementation based on principal component analysis and polynomial basis functions. To further improve prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, we also introduce a strategy to identify and fit a sparse model structure, thanks to a modified hybrid least angle regression approach that minimizes the expected forecast error, rather than the one-step-ahead prediction error. Since F-NARX is particularly well-suited to modeling engineering structures typically governed by physical processes, we investigate the behavior and capabilities of our F-NARX implementation on two case studies: an eight-story building under wind loading and a three-story steel frame under seismic loading. Our results demonstrate that F-NARX has several favorable properties over classical NARX, making it well suited to emulate engineering systems with high accuracy over extended time periods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs learn governing principles of dynamical systems, revealing an in-context neural scaling law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00795v4)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot tasks, including time-series forecasting. However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models. We study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest. Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Its primary goal is to enhance the adaptability and resilience of machine learning models when faced with new, unseen, and potentially adversarial data that significantly diverges from their original training datasets. In this paper, we investigate time series OOD generalization via pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We first propose a novel \textbf{T}ri-level learning framework for \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries \textbf{O}OD generalization, termed TTSO, which considers both sample-level and group-level uncertainties. This formula offers a fresh theoretic perspective for formulating and analyzing OOD generalization problem. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis to justify this method is well motivated. We then develop a stratified localization algorithm tailored for this tri-level optimization problem, theoretically demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis also reveals that the iteration complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is bounded by O($\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Applying Quantum Autoencoders for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04154v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition or medical diagnosis. Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches. However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time series data is a widely unexplored research field. This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with their simulated counterparts.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[ROSE: Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting with Decomposed Frequency Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17478v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing collection of time series data from various domains, there arises a strong demand for general time series forecasting models pre-trained on a large number of time-series datasets to support a variety of downstream prediction tasks. Enabling general time series forecasting faces two challenges: how to obtain unified representations from multi-domian time series data, and how to capture domain-specific features from time series data across various domains for adaptive transfer in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting Model with Decomposed Frequency Learning (ROSE), a novel pre-trained model for time series forecasting. ROSE employs Decomposed Frequency Learning for the pre-training task, which decomposes coupled semantic and periodic information in time series with frequency-based masking and reconstruction to obtain unified representations across domains. We also equip ROSE with a Time Series Register, which learns to generate a register codebook to capture domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances domain-adaptive transfer by selecting related register tokens on downstream tasks. After pre-training on large-scale time series data, ROSE achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 8 real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, even in few-shot scenarios, it demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods trained with full data.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLA-DA: Global-Local Alignment Domain Adaptation for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06671v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike images and natural language tokens, time series data is highly semantically sparse, resulting in labor-intensive label annotations. Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation (UDA and SSDA) have demonstrated efficiency in addressing this issue by utilizing pre-labeled source data to train on unlabeled or partially labeled target data. However, in domain adaptation methods designed for downstream classification tasks, directly adapting labeled source samples with unlabelled target samples often results in similar distributions across various classes, thereby compromising the performance of the target classification task. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a Global-Local Alignment Domain Adaptation (GLA-DA) method for multivariate time series data. Data from two domains were initially encoded to align in an intermediate feature space adversarially, achieving Global Feature Alignment (GFA). Subsequently, GLA-DA leveraged the consistency between similarity-based and deep learning-based models to assign pseudo labels to unlabeled target data. This process aims to preserve differences among data with distinct labels by aligning the samples with the same class labels together, achieving Local Class Alignment (LCA). We implemented GLA-DA in both UDA and SSDA scenarios, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on various public datasets. Ablation experiments underscored the significance of key components within GLA-DA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Physics-guided Time Series Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06651v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various scientific and engineering fields, the primary research areas have revolved around physics-based dynamical systems modeling and data-driven time series analysis. According to the embedding theory, dynamical systems and time series can be mutually transformed using observation functions and physical reconstruction techniques. Based on this, we propose Embedding Duality Theory, where the parameterized embedding layer essentially provides a linear estimation of the non-linear time series dynamics. This theory enables us to bypass the parameterized embedding layer and directly employ physical reconstruction techniques to acquire a data embedding representation. Utilizing physical priors results in a 10X reduction in parameters, a 3X increase in speed, and maximum performance boosts of 18% in expert, 22% in few-shot, and 53\% in zero-shot tasks without any hyper-parameter tuning. All methods are encapsulated as a plug-and-play module</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Time Series Feature Understanding: A Comprehensive Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16563v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for automatic time series analysis and reporting, which is a critical task across many domains, spanning healthcare, finance, climate, energy, and many more. In this paper, we propose a framework for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of LLMs on time series understanding, encompassing both univariate and multivariate forms. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of time series features, a critical framework that delineates various characteristics inherent in time series data. Leveraging this taxonomy, we have systematically designed and synthesized a diverse dataset of time series, embodying the different outlined features, each accompanied by textual descriptions.

While green bubbles may be examined through a social bubble hypothesis, it is essential not to neglect a Climate Minsky moment triggered by sudden asset price changes. The significant increase in green investments highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of these market dynamics. Therefore, the current paper introduces a novel paradigm for studying such phenomena. Focusing on the renewable energy sector, Statistical Process Control (SPC) methodologies are employed to identify green bubbles within time series data. Furthermore, search volume indexes and social factors are incorporated into established econometric models to reveal potential implications for the financial system. Inspired by Joseph Schumpeter's perspectives on business cycles, this study recognizes green bubbles as a necessary evil for facilitating a successful transition towards a more sustainable future.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Ventilator pressure prediction using recurrent neural network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06552v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a recurrent neural network approach to simulating mechanical ventilator pressure. The traditional mechanical ventilator has a control pressure that is monitored by a medical practitioner and can behave incorrectly if the proper pressure is not applied. This paper takes advantage of recent research and develops a simulator based on a deep sequence model to predict airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the inspiratory phase of a breath given a time series of control parameters and lung attributes. This method demonstrates the effectiveness of neural network-based controllers in tracking pressure wave forms significantly better than the current industry standard and provides insights into the development of effective and robust pressure-controlled mechanical ventilators. The paper will measure as the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual pressures during the inspiratory phase of each breath.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient representation learning of scintillation signal characteristics with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear radiation detectors based on scintillators are widely used in particle and high energy physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks are superior to traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation signal characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. By directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals without data embedding, including the zero-frequency component, adjusting convolution scheme for low-frequency components, and unbiasedly re-weighting features from different frequencies, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea on simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and on experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models without representation learning.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

EUR/USD case study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06476v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper focuses on the link between information, investors' expectations and market price movement. EUR/USD market is examined from communication-theoretical perspective on the dynamics of information and meaning. We build upon the quantitative theory of meaning as a complement to the quantitative theory of information. Different groups of investors entertain different criteria to process information, so that the same information can be supplied with different meanings. Meanings shape investors' expectations which are revealed in market asset price movement. This dynamics can be captured by non-linear evolutionary equation. We use a computationally efficient technique of logistic Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT) to analyze EUR/USD market. The results reveal the latent EUR/USD trend structure which coincides with the model predicted time series indicating that proposed model can adequately describe some patterns of investors' behavior. Proposed methodology can be used to better understand and forecast future market assets' price movement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Sparse Sampling: A Framework for Variable-Length Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06412v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the majority of time series classification research has focused on modeling fixed-length sequences, variable-length time series classification (VTSC) remains critical in healthcare, where sequence length may vary among patients and events. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{S}$tochastic $\textbf{S}$parse $\textbf{S}$ampling (SSS), a novel VTSC framework developed for medical time series. SSS manages variable-length sequences by sparsely sampling fixed windows to compute local predictions, which are then aggregated and calibrated to form a global prediction. We apply SSS to the task of seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, a critical VTSC problem requiring identification of seizure-inducing brain regions from variable-length electrophysiological time series. We evaluate our method on the Epilepsy iEEG Multicenter Dataset, a heterogeneous collection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings obtained from four independent medical centers. SSS demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across most medical centers, and superior performance on all out-of-distribution (OOD) unseen medical centers. Additionally, SSS naturally provides post-hoc insights into local signal characteristics related to the SOZ, by visualizing temporally averaged local predictions throughout the signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Forecasting: Compositional Time Series Reasoning for End-to-End Task Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04047v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent decades, there has been substantial advances in time series models and benchmarks across various individual tasks, such as time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. Meanwhile, compositional reasoning in time series is prevalent in real-world applications (e.g., decision-making and compositional question answering) and is in great demand. Unlike simple tasks that primarily focus on predictive accuracy, compositional reasoning emphasizes the synthesis of diverse information from both time series data and various domain knowledge, making it distinct and extremely more challenging. In this paper, we introduce Compositional Time Series Reasoning, a new task of handling intricate multistep reasoning tasks from time series data. Specifically, this new task focuses on various question instances requiring structural and compositional reasoning abilities on time series data, such as decision-making and compositional question answering. As an initial attempt to tackle this novel task, we developed TS-Reasoner, a program-aided approach that utilizes large language model (LLM) to decompose a complex task into steps of programs that leverage existing time series models and numerical subroutines. Unlike existing reasoning work which only calls off-the-shelf modules, TS-Reasoner allows for the creation of custom modules and provides greater flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge as well as user-specified constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive set of experiments. These promising results indicate potential opportunities in the new task of time series reasoning and highlight the need for further research.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stabilized Neural Prediction of Potential Outcomes in Continuous Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03514v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patient trajectories from electronic health records are widely used to predict potential outcomes of treatments over time, which then allows to personalize care. Yet, existing neural methods for this purpose have a key limitation: while some adjust for time-varying confounding, these methods assume that the time series are recorded in discrete time. In other words, they are constrained to settings where measurements and treatments are conducted at fixed time steps, even though this is unrealistic in medical practice. In this work, we aim to predict potential outcomes in continuous time. The latter is of direct practical relevance because it allows for modeling patient trajectories where measurements and treatments take place at arbitrary, irregular timestamps. We thus propose a new method called stabilized continuous time inverse propensity network (SCIP-Net). For this, we further derive stabilized inverse propensity weights for robust prediction of the potential outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, our SCIP-Net is the first neural method that performs proper adjustments for time-varying confounding in continuous time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free LLM-generated Text Detection by Mining Token Probability Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06072v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality texts across diverse domains. However, the potential misuse of LLMs has raised significant concerns, underscoring the urgent need for reliable detection of LLM-generated texts. Conventional training-based detectors often struggle with generalization, particularly in cross-domain and cross-model scenarios. In contrast, training-free methods, which focus on inherent discrepancies through carefully designed statistical features, offer improved generalization and interpretability. Despite this, existing training-free detection methods typically rely on global text sequence statistics, neglecting the modeling of local discriminative features, thereby limiting their detection efficacy. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free detector, termed \textbf{Lastde} that synergizes local and global statistics for enhanced detection. For the first time, we introduce time series analysis to LLM-generated text detection, capturing the temporal dynamics of token probability sequences. By integrating these local statistics with global ones, our detector reveals significant disparities between human and LLM-generated texts. We also propose an efficient alternative, \textbf{Lastde++} to enable real-time detection. Extensive experiments on six datasets involving cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-lingual detection scenarios, under both white-box and black-box settings, demonstrated that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness against paraphrasing attacks compared to existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enforcing Interpretability in Time Series Transformers: A Concept Bottleneck Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06070v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent push of research on Transformer-based models for long-term time series forecasting, even though they are inherently difficult to interpret and explain. While there is a large body of work on interpretability methods for various domains and architectures, the interpretability of Transformer-based forecasting models remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we develop a framework based on Concept Bottleneck Models to enforce interpretability of time series Transformers. We modify the training objective to encourage a model to develop representations similar to predefined interpretable concepts. In our experiments, we enforce similarity using Centered Kernel Alignment, and the predefined concepts include time features and an interpretable, autoregressive surrogate model (AR). We apply the framework to the Autoformer model, and present an in-depth analysis for a variety of benchmark tasks. We find that the model performance remains mostly unaffected, while the model shows much improved interpretability. Additionally, interpretable concepts become local, which makes the trained model easily intervenable. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a successful intervention in the scenario of a time shift in the data, which eliminates the need to retrain.</p></details> |  |

Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 11 figures, 3 tables.

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks. In addition, we provide the original code to replicate the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Towards a General Time Series Anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15273v3)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly increasing stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniform Convergence Rate of the Nonparametric Estimator for Integrated Diffusion Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05822v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonparametric estimation of integrated diffusion processes has been thoroughly studied, primarily focusing on point-wise convergence. This paper firstly obtains the uniform convergence rates of the Nadaraya-Watson estimators for the coefficients of the integrated diffusion processes. We derive the uniform convergence rates over unbounded support under the shrinking observation interval and long time span assumption. While existing literature suggests that the convergence rate for the diffusion coefficient estimator in continuous-time diffusion processes can reach $(\log n/n)^{2/5}$, which corresponds to the minimax lower bound in sup-norm risk for nonparametric estimation with i.i.d. data. However, we find that the diffusion coefficient estimator of integrated diffusion processes can not attain this rate. Our results are necessary tools for specification testing and semiparametric estimation of certain types of diffusion processes and time series, based on nonparametric estimators, with applications in fields such as finance, geology, and physics.</p></details> |  |

The covariance matrix is assumed to be well-approximable in a linear space of lower dimension $K_n$ with eigenvalues uniformly bounded away from zero and infinity. We prove asymptotic equivalence of this experiment and a class of $K_n$-dimensional Gaussian models with informative expectation in Le Cam's sense when $n$ tends to infinity and $K_n$ is allowed to increase moderately in $n$ at a polynomial rate. For this purpose we derive a new localization technique for non-i.i.d. data and a novel high-dimensional Central Limit Law in total variation distance. These results are key ingredients to show asymptotic equivalence between the experiments of locally stationary Gaussian time series and a bivariate Wiener process with the log spectral density as its drift. Therein a novel class of matrices is introduced which generalizes circulant Toeplitz matrices traditionally used for strictly stationary time series.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach converts MTS into one-dimensional sequences of spatially evolving events, preserving the complex coupling relationships between dimensions. By employing a variable-length tuple mining method, key spatiotemporal features are extracted, enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of time series analysis. Unlike conventional models, this unsupervised method does not rely on large training datasets, making it adaptable across different domains. Experimental results from motion sequence classification validate the model's superior performance in capturing intricate patterns within the data. The proposed framework has significant potential for applications across various fields, including backend services for monitoring and optimizing IT infrastructure, medical diagnosis through continuous patient monitoring and health trend analysis, and internet businesses for tracking user behavior and forecasting sales. This work offers a new theoretical foundation and technical support for advancing time series data mining and its practical applications in human behavior recognition and other domains.</p></details> |  |

But time series data generated from real-world applications always exhibits high variance and lots of noise, which makes it difficult to capture the inherent periodic patterns of the data, hurting the prediction accuracy significantly. To address this issue, we propose the Esiformer, which apply interpolation on the original data, decreasing the overall variance of the data and alleviating the influence of noise. What's more, we enhanced the vanilla transformer with a robust Sparse FFN. It can enhance the representation ability of the model effectively, and maintain the excellent robustness, avoiding the risk of overfitting compared with the vanilla implementation. Through evaluations on challenging real-world datasets, our method outperforms leading model PatchTST, reducing MSE by 6.5% and MAE by 5.8% in multivariate time series forecasting.

However, effectively capturing both the global sequence dependence and local detail features within time series data remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel generative self-supervised method called TimeDART, denoting Diffusion Auto-regressive Transformer for Time series forecasting. In TimeDART, we treat time series patches as basic modeling units. Specifically, we employ an self-attention based Transformer encoder to model the dependencies of inter-patches. Additionally, we introduce diffusion and denoising mechanisms to capture the detail locality features of intra-patch. Notably, we design a cross-attention-based denoising decoder that allows for adjustable optimization difficulty in the self-supervised task, facilitating more effective self-supervised pre-training. Furthermore, the entire model is optimized in an auto-regressive manner to obtain transferable representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeDART achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance compared to the most advanced competitive methods in forecasting tasks.

LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures.

Existing methods for detecting abnormal graphs can suffer from multiple limitations, such as high false positive rates as well as difficulties with handling variable-sized graphs and non-trivial temporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a technique where temporal dependencies are explicitly modelled via time series analysis of a large set of pertinent graph features, followed by using residuals to remove the dependencies. Extreme Value Theory is then used to robustly model and classify any remaining extremes, aiming to produce low false positives rates. Comparative evaluations on a multitude of graph instances show that the proposed approach obtains considerably better accuracy than TensorSplat and Laplacian Anomaly Detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended and revised version of arXiv:2210.07407</p></details> |

Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2024)</p></details> |

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification and estimation for matrix time series CP-factor models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05634v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the identification and the estimation for matrix time series CP-factor models. Unlike the generalized eigenanalysis-based method of Chang et al. (2023) which requires the two factor loading matrices to be full-ranked, the newly proposed estimation can handle rank-deficient factor loading matrices. The estimation procedure consists of the spectral decomposition of several matrices and a matrix joint diagonalization algorithm, resulting in low computational cost. The theoretical guarantee established without the stationarity assumption shows that the proposed estimation exhibits a faster convergence rate than that of Chang et al. (2023). In fact the new estimator is free from the adverse impact of any eigen-gaps, unlike most eigenanalysis-based methods such as that of Chang et al. (2023). Furthermore, in terms of the error rates of the estimation, the proposed procedure is equivalent to handling a vector time series of dimension $\max(p,q)$ instead of $p \times q$, where $(p, q)$ are the dimensions of the matrix time series concerned. We have achieved this without assuming the "near orthogonality" of the loadings under various incoherence conditions often imposed in the CP-decomposition literature, see Han and Zhang (2022), Han et al. (2024) and the references within. Illustration with both simulated and real matrix time series data shows the usefulness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

We explore whether these capabilities can be extended to continuous vectors from diverse domains, obtained from black-box pretrained encoders. By aligning input data with an LLM's embedding space through lightweight projectors, we observe that LLMs can effectively process and learn from these projected vectors, which we term Vector-ICL. In particular, we find that pretraining projectors with general language modeling objectives enables Vector-ICL, while task-specific finetuning further enhances performance. In our experiments across various tasks and modalities, including text reconstruction, numerical function regression, text classification, summarization, molecule captioning, time-series classification, graph classification, and fMRI decoding, Vector-ICL often surpasses both few-shot ICL and domain-specific model or tuning. We further conduct analyses and case studies, indicating the potential of LLMs to process vector representations beyond traditional token-based paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05602v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM employs amortized inference to decouple representation learning from the latent dynamics. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Identification and Visualization of Group Training Activities Using Wearable Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05452v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) identifies daily activities from time-series data collected by wearable devices like smartwatches. Recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and low-cost sensors have broadened HAR applications across fields like healthcare, biometrics, sports, and personal fitness. However, challenges remain in efficiently processing the vast amounts of data generated by these devices and developing models that can accurately recognize a wide range of activities from continuous recordings, without relying on predefined activity training sessions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for imputing, analyzing, and identifying activities from wearable data, specifically targeting group training scenarios without explicit activity sessions. Our approach is based on data collected from 135 soldiers wearing Garmin 55 smartwatches over six months. The framework integrates multiple data streams, handles missing data through cross-domain statistical methods, and identifies activities with high accuracy using machine learning (ML). Additionally, we utilized statistical analysis techniques to evaluate the performance of each individual within the group, providing valuable insights into their respective positions in the group in an easy-to-understand visualization. These visualizations facilitate easy understanding of performance metrics, enhancing group interactions and informing individualized training programs. We evaluate our framework through traditional train-test splits and out-of-sample scenarios, focusing on the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, we address sleep data imputation without relying on ML, improving recovery analysis. Our findings demonstrate the potential of wearable data for accurately identifying group activities, paving the way for intelligent, data-driven training solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Understand Time Series Anomalies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05440v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: 1. LLMs understand time series better as *images* rather than as text 2. LLMs did not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in *explicit reasoning* about time series analysis 3. Contrary to common beliefs, LLM's understanding of time series *do not* stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities 4. LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis *vary significantly* across different model architectures This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand time series anomalies, many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold. These insights pave the way for more effective LLM-based approaches in time series analysis, bridging the gap between forecasting and anomaly detection applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regression Conformal Prediction under Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05263v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is crucial to account for the imperfect predictions of machine learning algorithms for high-impact applications. Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for uncertainty quantification that generates calibrated prediction intervals with valid coverage. In this work, we study how CP intervals are affected by bias - the systematic deviation of a prediction from ground truth values - a phenomenon prevalent in many real-world applications. We investigate the influence of bias on interval lengths of two different types of adjustments -- symmetric adjustments, the conventional method where both sides of the interval are adjusted equally, and asymmetric adjustments, a more flexible method where the interval can be adjusted unequally in positive or negative directions. We present theoretical and empirical analyses characterizing how symmetric and asymmetric adjustments impact the "tightness" of CP intervals for regression tasks. Specifically for absolute residual and quantile-based non-conformity scores, we prove: 1) the upper bound of symmetrically adjusted interval lengths increases by $2|b|$ where $b$ is a globally applied scalar value representing bias, 2) asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are not affected by bias, and 3) conditions when asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are guaranteed to be smaller than symmetric ones. Our analyses suggest that even if predictions exhibit significant drift from ground truth values, asymmetrically adjusted intervals are still able to maintain the same tightness and validity of intervals as if the drift had never happened, while symmetric ones significantly inflate the lengths. We demonstrate our theoretical results with two real-world prediction tasks: sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction and time-series weather forecasting. Our work paves the way for more bias-robust machine learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, code available at: https://github.com/matthewyccheung/conformal-metric</p></details> |

In particular, identifying causal relationships in situations that include hidden factors is a major challenge for methods that rely solely on observational data for building causal models. This paper proposes CAnDOIT, a causal discovery method to reconstruct causal models using both observational and interventional time-series data. The use of interventional data in the causal analysis is crucial for real-world applications, such as robotics, where the scenario is highly complex and observational data alone are often insufficient to uncover the correct causal structure. Validation of the method is performed initially on randomly generated synthetic models and subsequently on a well-known benchmark for causal structure learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can effectively handle data from interventions and exploit them to enhance the accuracy of the causal analysis. A Python implementation of CAnDOIT has also been developed and is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/lcastri/causalflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> |

In this paper, we present PF-GAP, an extension of RF-GAP proximities to proximity forests, an accurate and efficient time series classification model. We use the forest proximities in connection with Multi-Dimensional Scaling to obtain vector embeddings of univariate time series, comparing the embeddings to those obtained using various time series distance measures. We also use the forest proximities alongside Local Outlier Factors to investigate the connection between misclassified points and outliers, comparing with nearest neighbor classifiers which use time series distance measures. We show that the forest proximities may exhibit a stronger connection between misclassified points and outliers than nearest neighbor classifiers.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, the framework for the statistical analysis of such models is still incomplete. In contrast, multiple versions of the law of large numbers and the (functional) central limit theorem have been established for weakly dependent variables. We prove the transition of mixing properties of the exogenous regressor to the response through a coupling argument, leveraging these established results. Furthermore, we study Markov chains in random environments under a suitable form of drift and minorization condition when the environment process is non-stationary, merely having favorable mixing properties. Following a novel statistical estimation theory approach and using the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, we also establish the functional central limit theorem. Additionally, we apply our framework to single-server queuing models. Overall, these results open the door to the statistical analysis of a large class of random iterative models.</p></details> | 33 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Testing procedures based on maximum likelihood estimation for Marked Hawkes processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05008v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hawkes model is a past-dependent point process, widely used in various fields for modeling temporal clustering of events. Extending this framework, the multidimensional marked Hawkes process incorporates multiple interacting event types and additional marks, enhancing its capability to model complex dependencies in multivariate time series data. However, increasing the complexity of the model also increases the computational cost of the associated estimation methods and may induce an overfitting of the model. Therefore, it is essential to find a trade-off between accuracy and artificial complexity of the model. In order to find the appropriate version of Hawkes processes, we address, in this paper, the tasks of model fit evaluation and parameter testing for marked Hawkes processes. This article focuses on parametric Hawkes processes with exponential memory kernels, a popular variant for its theoretical and practical advantages. Our work introduces robust testing methodologies for assessing model parameters and complexity, building upon and extending previous theoretical frameworks. We then validate the practical robustness of these tests through comprehensive numerical studies, especially in scenarios where theoretical guarantees remains incomplete.</p></details> |  |

Detecting them has scientific value for environmental psychology but comes with challenges of its own: namely, privacy preservation and limited labeled data. In this paper, we address these two challenges via a combination of edge computing and cloud computing. For privacy preservation, we have designed an acoustic sensor which computes third-octave spectrograms on the fly instead of recording audio waveforms. For sample-efficient machine learning, we have repurposed a pretrained audio neural network (PANN) via spectral transcoding and label space adaptation. A small-scale study in a neonatological intensive care unit (NICU) confirms that the time series of detected events align with another modality of measurement: i.e., electronic badges for parents and healthcare professionals. Hence, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of polyphonic machine listening in a hospital ward while guaranteeing privacy by design.</p></details> |  |

We trained a gated recurrent unit with decay mechanisms, called GRU-D, for a binary classification between elderly - and young patients. We extracted time series for 5 vital signs from MIMIC-IV as model inputs. GRU-D was evaluated with means of 0.780 AUROC and 0.810 AUPRC on bootstrapped data. Interpreting trained model parameters, we found differences in blood pressure missingness and respiratory rate missingness as important predictors learned by parameterized hidden gated units.

| **[TimeCNN: Refining Cross-Variable Interaction on Time Point for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04853v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is extensively applied across diverse domains. Transformer-based models demonstrate significant potential in modeling cross-time and cross-variable interaction. However, we notice that the cross-variable correlation of multivariate time series demonstrates multifaceted (positive and negative correlations) and dynamic progression over time, which is not well captured by existing Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we propose a TimeCNN model to refine cross-variable interactions to enhance time series forecasting. Its key innovation is timepoint-independent, where each time point has an independent convolution kernel, allowing each time point to have its independent model to capture relationships among variables. This approach effectively handles both positive and negative correlations and adapts to the evolving nature of variable relationships over time. Extensive experiments conducted on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, our model achieves significant reductions in computational requirements (approximately 60.46%) and parameter count (about 57.50%), while delivering inference speeds 3 to 4 times faster than the benchmark iTransformer model</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Interpretable Hierarchical Dynamical Systems Models from Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04814v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In science, we are often interested in obtaining a generative model of the underlying system dynamics from observed time series. While powerful methods for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single domain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage it for generalization is still an open question. This becomes particularly important when individual time series are short, and group-level information may help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. At the same time, averaging is not an option in DSR, as it will wipe out crucial dynamical properties (e.g., limit cycles in one domain vs. chaos in another). Hence, a framework is needed that enables to efficiently harvest group-level (multi-domain) information while retaining all single-domain dynamical characteristics. Here we provide such a hierarchical approach and showcase it on popular DSR benchmarks, as well as on neuroscientific and medical time series. In addition to faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our unsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in which datasets with similar dynamics cluster. The features spanning these spaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often linear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the underlying system. Finally, we illustrate transfer learning and generalization to new parameter regimes.</p></details> | Preprint |

To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem. We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity, multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate generative Transformers on time series, which can effectively capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches) and is further strengthened by position embeddings in both temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. As a large time series model, it demonstrates notable model transferability by large-scale pre-training, as well as contextual flexibility in token lengths, positioning it as a one-for-all forecaster.</p></details> |  |

To address its operational challenges, we propose a physics-informed hybrid time-series neural network (NN) surrogate to predict the dynamic performance of IESs across multiple time scales. This neural network-based modeling approach develops time-series multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for the operating units and integrates them with prior process knowledge about system structure and fundamental dynamics. This integration forms three hybrid NNs (long-term, slow, and fast MLPs) that predict the entire system dynamics across multiple time scales. Leveraging these MLPs, we design an NN-based scheduler and an NN-based economic model predictive control (NEMPC) framework to meet global operational requirements: rapid electrical power responsiveness to operators requests, adequate cooling supply to customers, and increased system profitability, while addressing the dynamic time-scale multiplicity present in IESs. The proposed day-ahead scheduler is formulated using the ReLU network-based MLP, which effectively represents IES performance under a broad range of conditions from a long-term perspective. The scheduler is then exactly recast into a mixed-integer linear programming problem for efficient evaluation. The real-time NEMPC, based on slow and fast MLPs, comprises two sequential distributed control agents: a slow NEMPC for the cooling-dominant subsystem with slower transient responses and a fast NEMPC for the power-dominant subsystem with faster responses. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the developed scheduler and NEMPC schemes outperform their respective benchmark scheduler and controller by about 25% and 40%. Together, they enhance overall system performance by over 70% compared to benchmark approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Fourier Modelling: A Highly Compact Approach to Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04703v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural time-series analysis has traditionally focused on modeling data in the time domain, often with some approaches incorporating equivalent Fourier domain representations as auxiliary spectral features. In this work, we shift the main focus to frequency representations, modeling time-series data fully and directly in the Fourier domain. We introduce Neural Fourier Modelling (NFM), a compact yet powerful solution for time-series analysis. NFM is grounded in two key properties of the Fourier transform (FT): (i) the ability to model finite-length time series as functions in the Fourier domain, treating them as continuous-time elements in function space, and (ii) the capacity for data manipulation (such as resampling and timespan extension) within the Fourier domain. We reinterpret Fourier-domain data manipulation as frequency extrapolation and interpolation, incorporating this as a core learning mechanism in NFM, applicable across various tasks. To support flexible frequency extension with spectral priors and effective modulation of frequency representations, we propose two learning modules: Learnable Frequency Tokens (LFT) and Implicit Neural Fourier Filters (INFF). These modules enable compact and expressive modeling in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks (forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification), including challenging time-series scenarios with previously unseen sampling rates at test time. Moreover, NFM is highly compact, requiring fewer than 40K parameters in each task, with time-series lengths ranging from 100 to 16K.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to conference (currently under review)</p></details> |
| **[TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

| **[FredNormer: Frequency Domain Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01860v2)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</p></details> |  |

Persistent homology serves as a tool to track changes of homology in the filtration. The outcome of the topological analysis of data varies depending on the choice of filtration, making the selection of filtration crucial. Filtration learning is an attempt to find an optimal filtration that minimizes the loss function. Exact Multi-parameter Persistent Homology (EMPH) has been recently proposed, particularly for topological time-series analysis, that utilizes the exact formula of rank invariant instead of calculating it. In this paper, we propose a framework for filtration learning of EMPH. We formulate an optimization problem and propose an algorithm for solving the problem. We then apply the proposed algorithm to several classification problems. Particularly, we derive the exact formula of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the filtration parameters, which makes it possible to directly update the filtration without using automatic differentiation, significantly enhancing the learning process.</p></details> | 26 pages, Version 2 |

In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning methods offered unprecedented performance in medical signal processing but at a cost: they were compute-intensive and lacked interpretability. We propose Sparse Mixture of Learned Kernels (SMoLK), an interpretable architecture for medical time series processing. SMoLK learns a set of lightweight flexible kernels that form a single-layer sparse neural network, providing not only interpretability, but also efficiency, robustness, and generalization to unseen data distributions. We introduce a parameter reduction techniques to reduce the size of SMoLK's networks while maintaining performance. We test SMoLK on two important tasks common to many consumer wearables: photoplethysmography (PPG) artifact detection and atrial fibrillation detection from single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We find that SMoLK matches the performance of models orders of magnitude larger. It is particularly suited for real-time applications using low-power devices, and its interpretability benefits high-stakes situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as an article in Nature Machine Intelligence (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00898-4). 23 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

To accurately identify causal connectivity for such specified objectives, it is necessary to properly address the influence of all other nodes within the network. The proposed procedure herein starts with the estimation of a low-dimensional representation of the other nodes in the network utilizing (frequency-domain-based) spectral dynamic principal component analysis (sDPCA). The resulting scores can then be removed from the nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the HDN. Accordingly, causal interactions can be dissected between nodes that are isolated from the effects of the network. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been shown to be applicable to multichannel EEG networks.</p></details> |  |

Discrete-time dynamic models are widely used to model biological processes, but it is often difficult to determine these parameters. In this paper, we propose a symbolic-numeric approach for parameter estimation in discrete-time models that involve univariate non-algebraic (locally) analytic functions such as exp. We illustrate the performance (precision) of our approach by applying our approach to two archetypal discrete-time models in biology (the flour beetle 'LPA' model and discrete Lotka-Volterra competition model). Unlike optimization-based methods, our algorithm guarantees to find all solutions of the parameter values up to a specified precision given time-series data for the measured variables provided that there are finitely many parameter values that fit the data and that the used polynomial system solver can find all roots of the associated polynomial system with interval coefficients.</p></details> |  |

Despite its proficiency in capturing time series characteristics, these techniques often overlook a critical factor - the inherent noise in this type of data, a consideration usually emphasized in general time series analysis. Moreover, there is a notable absence of attention to developing efficient yet lightweight encoder architectures, with an undue focus on delivering contrastive losses. Our work address these gaps by proposing an innovative training strategy that promotes consistent representation learning, accounting for the presence of noise-prone signals in natural time series. Furthermore, we propose an encoder architecture that incorporates dilated convolution within the Inception block, resulting in a scalable and robust network with a wide receptive field. Experimental findings underscore the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across various tasks, including forecasting, classification, and abnormality detection. Notably, our method attains the top rank in over two-thirds of the classification UCR datasets, utilizing only 40% of the parameters compared to the second-best approach.

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |
| **[Oscillatory State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03943v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba by nearly 2x and LRU by 2.5x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAS-Norm: Score-Driven Adaptive Normalization for Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03935v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their popularity, deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to time series forecasting often fail to beat simpler statistical models. One of the main causes of this suboptimal performance is the data non-stationarity present in many processes. In particular, changes in the mean and variance of the input data can disrupt the predictive capability of a DNN. In this paper, we first show how DNN forecasting models fail in simple non-stationary settings. We then introduce GAS-Norm, a novel methodology for adaptive time series normalization and forecasting based on the combination of a Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) model and a Deep Neural Network. The GAS approach encompasses a score-driven family of models that estimate the mean and variance at each new observation, providing updated statistics to normalize the input data of the deep model. The output of the DNN is eventually denormalized using the statistics forecasted by the GAS model, resulting in a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both statistical modeling and deep learning. The adaptive normalization improves the performance of the model in non-stationary settings. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to any DNN forecasting model. To empirically validate our proposal, we first compare GAS-Norm with other state-of-the-art normalization methods. We then combine it with state-of-the-art DNN forecasting models and test them on real-world datasets from the Monash open-access forecasting repository. Results show that deep forecasting models improve their performance in 21 out of 25 settings when combined with GAS-Norm compared to other normalization methods.</p></details> | Accepted at CIKM '24 |
| **[Hierarchical Ensemble-Based Feature Selection for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17544v3)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel ensemble approach for feature selection based on hierarchical stacking for non-stationarity and/or a limited number of samples with a large number of features. Our approach exploits the co-dependency between features using a hierarchical structure. Initially, a machine learning model is trained using a subset of features, and then the output of the model is updated using other algorithms in a hierarchical manner with the remaining features to minimize the target loss. This hierarchical structure allows for flexible depth and feature selection. By exploiting feature co-dependency hierarchically, our proposed approach overcomes the limitations of traditional feature selection methods and feature importance scores. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on synthetic and well-known real-life datasets, providing significant scalable and stable performance improvements compared to the traditional methods and the state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide the source code of our approach to facilitate further research and replicability of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-destructive Fault Diagnosis of Electronic Interconnects by Learning Signal Patterns of Reflection Coefficient in the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10207v3)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault detection and diagnosis of the interconnects are crucial for prognostics and health management (PHM) of electronics. Traditional methods, which rely on electronic signals as prognostic factors, often struggle to accurately identify the root causes of defects without resorting to destructive testing. Furthermore, these methods are vulnerable to noise interference, which can result in false alarms. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel, non-destructive approach for early fault detection and accurate diagnosis of interconnect defects, with improved noise resilience. Our approach uniquely utilizes the signal patterns of the reflection coefficient across a range of frequencies, enabling both root cause identification and severity assessment. This approach departs from conventional time-series analysis and effectively transforms the signal data into a format suitable for advanced learning algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a novel severity rating ensemble learning (SREL) approach, which enhances diagnostic accuracy and robustness in noisy environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for fault detection and diagnosis and has the potential to extend to real-world industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Microelectronics Reliability</p></details> |
| **[Functional Singular Value Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03619v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous functional data are commonly seen in time series and longitudinal data analysis. To capture the statistical structures of such data, we propose the framework of Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), a unified framework with structure-adaptive interpretability for the analysis of heterogeneous functional data. We establish the mathematical foundation of FSVD by proving its existence and providing its fundamental properties using operator theory. We then develop an implementation approach for noisy and irregularly observed functional data based on a novel joint kernel ridge regression scheme and provide theoretical guarantees for its convergence and estimation accuracy. The framework of FSVD also introduces the concepts of intrinsic basis functions and intrinsic basis vectors, which represent two fundamental statistical structures for random functions and connect FSVD to various tasks including functional principal component analysis, factor models, functional clustering, and functional completion. We compare the performance of FSVD with existing methods in several tasks through extensive simulation studies. To demonstrate the value of FSVD in real-world datasets, we apply it to extract temporal patterns from a COVID-19 case count dataset and perform data completion on an electronic health record dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning models that rely on massive labeled data have been utilized for TSM successfully. However, constructing a large-scale well-labeled dataset is difficult due to data annotation costs. Recently, pre-trained models have gradually attracted attention in the time series domain due to their remarkable performance in computer vision and natural language processing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of Time-Series Pre-Trained Models (TS-PTMs), aiming to guide the understanding, applying, and studying TS-PTMs. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the typical deep learning models employed in TSM. Then, we give an overview of TS-PTMs according to the pre-training techniques. The main categories we explore include supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised TS-PTMs. Further, extensive experiments involving 27 methods, 434 datasets, and 679 transfer learning scenarios are conducted to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of transfer learning strategies, Transformer-based models, and representative TS-PTMs. Finally, we point out some potential directions of TS-PTMs for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

While recent state-space models (SSMs) have made significant progress in this area, they often lack input-dependent filtering or require substantial increases in model complexity to handle input variability. We address this gap by introducing S7, a simplified yet powerful SSM that can handle input dependence while incorporating stable reparameterization and specific design choices to dynamically adjust state transitions based on input content, maintaining efficiency and performance. We prove that this reparameterization ensures stability in long-sequence modeling by keeping state transitions well-behaved over time. Additionally, it controls the gradient norm, enabling efficient training and preventing issues like exploding or vanishing gradients. S7 significantly outperforms baselines across various sequence modeling tasks, including neuromorphic event-based datasets, Long Range Arena benchmarks, and various physical and biological time series. Overall, S7 offers a more straightforward approach to sequence modeling without relying on complex, domain-specific inductive biases, achieving significant improvements across key benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables.

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

Leveraging a novel annotation pipeline, we are able to scale the annotated trajectories and generate a trajectory dataset with minimized difficulty bias. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLMs on AgentBank to get a series of agent models, Samoyed. Our comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of scaling the interaction trajectory data to acquire generalized agent capabilities.

| **[Reliable Probabilistic Human Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06905v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, like vehicles or robots, require reliable, accurate, fast, resource-efficient, scalable, and low-latency trajectory predictions to get initial knowledge about future locations and movements of surrounding objects for safe human-machine interaction. Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keepout constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements.

Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits. We deploy our approach on Husky UGV mobile platform, which move through the office corridors under proposed MPC local trajectory planner.

While prior works mostly rely on human feedback in the form of comparisons, language is a preferable modality that provides more informative insights into user preferences. In this work, we aim to incorporate comparative language feedback to iteratively improve robot trajectories and to learn reward functions that encode human preferences. To achieve this goal, we learn a shared latent space that integrates trajectory data and language feedback, and subsequently leverage the learned latent space to improve trajectories and learn human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate comparative language feedback into reward learning. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned latent space and the success of our learning algorithms.

In this paper, we study the problem of computing joint torques and grasping forces for time-optimal motion of an object, while ensuring that the grasp is not lost and any constraints on the motion of the object, either due to dynamics, environment contact, or no-slip requirements, are also satisfied. We present a second-order cone program (SOCP) formulation of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem that considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the hand-object and object-environment contacts. Since SOCPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved optimally in polynomial time using interior point methods, we can solve the trajectory optimization problem efficiently. We present simulation results on three examples, including a non-prehensile manipulation task, which shows the generality and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME). PREDICT more accurately infers nuanced human preferences improving over existing baselines by 66.2\% (gridworld environment) and 41.0\% (PLUME).</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Collaborative Filtering to Detect Anomalies in Human Semantic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18427v3)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |
| **[SplaTraj: Camera Trajectory Generation with Semantic Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06014v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent developments for robots to represent environments have focused on photorealistic reconstructions. This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Cyclists' Visual Preferences Through Shared Bike Trajectories and Street View Images Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03148v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cycling has gained global popularity for its health benefits and positive urban impacts. To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated visual preferences by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning(MEDIRL)and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing(DBS) trajectory and street view images(SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' visual preferences. We find that cyclists focus on specific street visual elements when making route decisions, which can be summarized as their attention to safety, street enclosure, and cycling comfort. Further analysis reveals the complex nonlinear effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a cost-effective perspective on streetscapes design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis. Our results demonstrate UAVDB's potential as a critical resource for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite recent research, planning three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories over a continuous temporal-spatial domain remains challenging due to the need to solve computationally intensive optimization problems. In this paper, we study UAV-assisted IoT data collection aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while accounting for the UAV's physical capabilities, the heterogeneous data demands of IoT nodes, and 3D terrain. We propose a matrix-based differential evolution with constraint handling (MDE-CH), a computation-efficient evolutionary algorithm designed to address non-convex constrained optimization problems with several different types of constraints. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed MDE-CH algorithm provides a continuous 3D temporal-spatial UAV trajectory capable of efficiently minimizing energy consumption under various practical constraints and outperforms the conventional fly-hover-fly model for both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |

This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 50% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

This necessitates advanced interactive multi-agent motion planning techniques. Generalized Nash equilibrium(GNE), a solution concept in constrained game theory, provides a mathematical model to predict the outcome of interactive motion planning, where each agent needs to account for other agents in the environment. However, in practice, multiple local GNEs may exist. Finding a single GNE itself is complex as it requires solving coupled constrained optimal control problems. Furthermore, finding all such local GNEs requires exploring the solution space of GNEs, which is a challenging task. This work proposes the MultiNash-PF framework to efficiently compute multiple local GNEs in constrained trajectory games. Potential games are a class of games for which a local GNE of a trajectory game can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem. We propose MultiNash-PF that integrates the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We first formulate the underlying game as a constrained potential game and then utilize the implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline approach.</p></details> |  |

Here, we extend by a significant step this proposal. Instead of using the explicit knowledge of the underlying equations of motion, we develop the method directly from system trajectories. This is crucial towards enhancing the practical implementation of the method in scenarios where solely data reflecting discrete snapshots of the system are available. We showcase the results of the method and the number of associated conservation laws obtained in a diverse range of examples including 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, the Toda lattice, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and the Calogero-Moser system.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners must rely on reliable uncertainty information about the predicted future behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. This paper addresses the so-far neglected problem of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction. We adopt a holistic approach that focuses on uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the influence of model composition. Our method is based on a theoretically grounded information-theoretic approach to measure uncertainty, allowing us to decompose total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components.

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

Specifically, the treble-functional UAVs are capable of offering communication and edge computing services to mobile users (MUs) in proximity, alongside their target sensing capabilities by using multi-input multi-output arrays. For the purpose of enhance the computation efficiency, we consider task compression, where each MU can partially compress their offloaded data prior to transmission to trim its size. The objective is to minimize the weighted energy consumption by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the UAVs' trajectories, the compression and offloading partition, the computation resource allocation, while fulfilling the causal-effect correlation between communication and computation as well as adhering to the constraints on sensing quality. To tackle it, we first reformulate the original problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP), which involves heterogeneous agents to decompose the large state spaces and action spaces of MDP. Then, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with attention mechanism to handle the decision-making problem. Simulation results validate the significant effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing energy consumption. Moreover, it demonstrates superior performance compared to the baselines in relation to resource utilization and convergence speed.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed trajectory is constructed by the concatenation of three circular arcs of varying radii. Such a trajectory guarantees a complete coverage of the maximum set of reachable lengths while minimising the number of changeover points in the trajectory to a maximum of two under all scenarios. Additionally, by using the notion of internally tangent circles, we expand the set of Circle-Circle-Circle trajectories to eight kinds, consisting of {LLL, LLR, LRR, LRL, RRL, RLL, RLR, RRR} paths. The paper presents a mathematical formulation of the proposed trajectory and the conditions for the existence and classification of each kind of trajectory. We also analyse the variation of the length of the trajectory using suitable elongation strategies and derive the set of reachable lengths for all pairs of oriented points.

| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This approach is the first of its kind to be applied to spatiotemporal data. By embedding $2+1$-dimensional spatiotemporal data into $\mathbb{R}^3$, we utilize persistent homology to detect loops within the trajectories in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our research reveals that, under normal conditions, trajectory data embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ over time do not form loops. Consequently, we can effectively identify anomalies characterized by the presence of loops within the trajectories. This method is robust and capable of detecting loops that are invariant to small perturbations, variations in geometric shape, and local coordinate projections. Additionally, our approach provides a novel perspective on anomaly detection, offering enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying atypical patterns in geospatial data. This approach has significant implications for various applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title: Identification of Anomalous Geospatial Trajectories via Persistent Homology Authors: Kyle Evans-Lee, Kevin Lamb Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures We present a method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies, commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data</p></details> |
| **[DOTS: Learning to Reason Dynamically in LLMs via Optimal Reasoning Trajectories Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03864v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Driven Parallel Trajectory Optimization in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06021v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground robots navigating in complex, dynamic environments must compute collision-free trajectories to avoid obstacles safely and efficiently. Nonconvex optimization is a popular method to compute a trajectory in real-time. However, these methods often converge to locally optimal solutions and frequently switch between different local minima, leading to inefficient and unsafe robot motion. In this work, We propose a novel topology-driven trajectory optimization strategy for dynamic environments that plans multiple distinct evasive trajectories to enhance the robot's behavior and efficiency. A global planner iteratively generates trajectories in distinct homotopy classes. These trajectories are then optimized by local planners working in parallel. While each planner shares the same navigation objectives, they are locally constrained to a specific homotopy class, meaning each local planner attempts a different evasive maneuver. The robot then executes the feasible trajectory with the lowest cost in a receding horizon manner. We demonstrate, on a mobile robot navigating among pedestrians, that our approach leads to faster and safer trajectories than existing planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, the application of B-spline curves for path-velocity coupled trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been highly limited because it is challenging to reduce the over-approximation of the vehicle shape and to create a collision-free trajectory using B-spline curves while satisfying kinodynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes novel disc-type swept volume (SV), incremental path flattening (IPF), and kinodynamic feasibility penalty methods. The disc-type SV estimation method is a new technique to reduce SV over-approximation and is used to find collision points for IPF. In IPF, the collision points are used to push the trajectory away from obstacles and to iteratively increase the curvature weight, thereby reducing SV and generating a collision-free trajectory. Additionally, to satisfy kinodynamic constraints for AVs using B-spline curves, we apply a clamped B-spline curvature penalty along with longitudinal and lateral velocity and acceleration penalties. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various simulated environments. We also conducted a real-world experiment using an AV, and our results validate the simulated tracking performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 21 figures, 5 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> |  |

The challenge arises from the non-convex nature of the optimization problem with multiple local optima, which usually requires a global search. Traditional numerical solvers struggle to find diverse solutions efficiently without appropriate initial guesses. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSolve, a general diffusion model-based solver for non-convex trajectory optimization. An expressive diffusion model is trained on pre-collected locally optimal solutions and efficiently samples initial guesses, which then warm-starts numerical solvers to fine-tune the feasibility and optimality. We also present DiffuSolve+, a novel constrained diffusion model with an additional loss in training that further reduces the problem constraint violations of diffusion samples. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved robustness, diversity, and a 2$\times$ to 11$\times$ increase in computational efficiency with our proposed method, which generalizes well to trajectory optimization problems of varying challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> |  |

Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction (FMTP) model, inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, we design a learnable memory array by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using defined quantization operations during the training phase. This approach further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, we develop an advanced reasoning engine based on language models to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recently, C-ADMM has been studied in robotics applications such as multi-vehicle target tracking and collaborative manipulation tasks. However, few works have investigated the performance of C-ADMM applied to non-convex problems in robotics applications due to a lack of theoretical guarantees. For this project, we aim to quantitatively explore and examine the convergence behavior of non-convex C-ADMM through the scope of distributed multi-robot trajectory planning. We propose a convex trajectory planning problem by leveraging C-ADMM and Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVCs) to get around the non-convex collision avoidance constraint and compare this convex C-ADMM algorithm to a non-convex C-ADMM baseline with non-convex collision avoidance constraints. We show that the convex C-ADMM algorithm requires 1000 fewer iterations to achieve convergence in a multi-robot waypoint navigation scenario. We also confirm that the non-convex C-ADMM baseline leads to sub-optimal solutions and violation of safety constraints in trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording. We propose a two-stage process. In the first stage we extract the demonstration trajectory offline. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. In the online trajectory generation stage, we first re-detect all objects, then warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene and execute it on the robot. To complete these steps, our method leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect and quantitatively test on demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at http://ditto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> |

This approach utilizes the contact-implicit differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework, merging the hard contact model with a linear complementarity constraint. We propose the analytical gradient of the contact impulse based on relaxed complementarity constraints to further the exploration of a variety of contact modes. By leveraging a hard contact model-based simulation and computation of search direction through a smooth gradient, our methodology identifies dynamically feasible state trajectories, control inputs, and contact forces while simultaneously unveiling new contact mode sequences. However, the broadened scope of contact modes does not always ensure real-world applicability. Recognizing this, we implemented differentiable cost terms to guide foot trajectories and make gait patterns. Furthermore, to address the challenge of unstable initial roll-outs in an MPC setting, we employ the multiple shooting variant of DDP. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world demonstrations using a 45 kg HOUND quadruped robot, performing various tasks in simulation and showcasing actual experiments involving a forward trot and a front-leg rearing motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version for The International Journal of Robotics Research (2024); published version at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241273645 / Videos at https://youtu.be/SXD4BJIfyoY</p></details> |
| **[Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |
| **[CVVLSNet: Vehicle Location and Speed Estimation Using Partial Connected Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00132v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time estimation of vehicle locations and speeds is crucial for developing many beneficial transportation applications in traffic management and control, e.g., adaptive signal control. Recent advances in communication technologies facilitate the emergence of connected vehicles (CVs), which can share traffic information with nearby CVs or infrastructures. At the early stage of connectivity, only a portion of vehicles are CVs. The locations and speeds for those non-CVs (NCs) are not accessible and must be estimated to obtain the full traffic information. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel CV-based Vehicle Location and Speed estimation network, CVVLSNet, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle locations and speeds exclusively using partial CV trajectory data. A road cell occupancy (RCO) method is first proposed to represent the variable vehicle state information. Spatiotemporal interactions can be integrated by simply fusing the RCO representations. Then, CVVLSNet, taking the Coding-RAte TransformEr (CRATE) network as a backbone, is introduced to estimate the vehicle locations and speeds. Moreover, physical vehicle size constraints are also considered in loss functions. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly outperformed the existing method under various CV penetration rates, signal timings, and volume-to-capacity ratios.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEADS-UP: Head-Mounted Egocentric Dataset for Trajectory Prediction in Blind Assistance Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20324v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce HEADS-UP, the first egocentric dataset collected from head-mounted cameras, designed specifically for trajectory prediction in blind assistance systems. With the growing population of blind and visually impaired individuals, the need for intelligent assistive tools that provide real-time warnings about potential collisions with dynamic obstacles is becoming critical. These systems rely on algorithms capable of predicting the trajectories of moving objects, such as pedestrians, to issue timely hazard alerts. However, existing datasets fail to capture the necessary information from the perspective of a blind individual. To address this gap, HEADS-UP offers a novel dataset focused on trajectory prediction in this context. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a semi-local trajectory prediction approach to assess collision risks between blind individuals and pedestrians in dynamic environments. Unlike conventional methods that separately predict the trajectories of both the blind individual (ego agent) and pedestrians, our approach operates within a semi-local coordinate system, a rotated version of the camera's coordinate system, facilitating the prediction process. We validate our method on the HEADS-UP dataset and implement the proposed solution in ROS, performing real-time tests on an NVIDIA Jetson GPU through a user study. Results from both dataset evaluations and live tests demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In the Violina framework, we optimize the coefficient matrices of state-space model and memory kernel in the given space using a projected gradient descent method so that its model prediction matches the set of multiple observed data. Using Violina we can identify a linear non-Markovian dynamical system with constraints corresponding to a priori knowledge on the model parameters and memory effects. Using synthetic data, we numerically demonstrate that the Markovian and non-Markovian state-space models identified by the proposed method have considerably better generalization performances compared to the models identified by an existing dynamic decomposition-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 18.9% to 23.4%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ACC 2025.

This paper proposes a suboptimal joint trajectory replanning (SJTR) method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of target orbit and flight trajectory after a fault within a convex optimization framework. By incorporating penalty coefficients for terminal constraints, the optimization solution adheres to the orbit redecision principle, thereby avoiding complex decision-making processes and resulting in a concise and rapid solution to the replanning problem. A learning-based warm-start scheme is proposed in conjunction with the designed SJTR method. Offline, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a dataset generated by the SJTR method. Online, the DNN provides initial guesses for the time optimization variables based on the current fault situation, enhancing the solving efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Numerical simulations of the MAV flight scenario under the thrust drop faults are performed, and Monte Carlo experiments and case studies across all orbit types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |

Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual "kinematic profile" which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.</p></details> |  |

There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

Methods for trajectory classification are particularly important to detect different movement patterns, while methods for regression to compute motility metrics and forecasting. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the processing of trajectories rendered as images via artificial neural networks with 2d convolutional layers (CNNs). This approach leverages the capability of CNNs to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, necessary to recognize complex shapes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitation of other machine learning methods that require input trajectories with a fixed number of points. However, rendering trajectories as images can introduce poorly investigated artifacts such as information loss due to the plotting of coordinates on a discrete grid, and spectral changes due to line thickness and aliasing. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CNNs for solving classification and regression problems from synthetic trajectories that have been rendered as images using different modalities. The parameters considered in this study include line thickness, image resolution, usage of motion history (color-coding of the temporal component) and anti-aliasing. Results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate image resolution according to model depth and motion history in applications where movement direction is critical.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

This paper introduces BoT-Drive, a planning algorithm that addresses uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. BoT-Drive employs driver models to characterize unknown behavioral intentions and utilizes their model parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By also treating driver models as decision-making actions for the autonomous vehicle, BoT-Drive effectively tackles the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To enhance safety and robustness, the planner further applies importance sampling to refine the driving trajectory conditioned on the planned high-level behavior. Evaluation on real-world data shows that BoT-Drive consistently outperforms both existing planning methods and learning-based methods in regular and complex urban driving scenes, demonstrating significant improvements in driving safety and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving on Unstructured Roads using Deep Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18399v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the application of autonomous driving in open-pit mining has garnered increasing attention for achieving safe and efficient mineral transportation. Compared to urban structured roads, unstructured roads in mining sites have uneven boundaries and lack clearly defined lane markings. This leads to a lack of sufficient constraint information for predicting the trajectories of other human-driven vehicles, resulting in higher uncertainty in trajectory prediction problems. A method is proposed to predict multiple possible trajectories and their probabilities of the target vehicle. The surrounding environment and historical trajectories of the target vehicle are encoded as a rasterized image, which is used as input to our deep convolutional network to predict the target vehicle's multiple possible trajectories.

Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |

However, due to the mobility of the vehicles and the limited computational resources for performing task offloading in near-real-time, such schemes may require high latency, thus, become even infeasible. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a Trajectory Prediction-based Pre-offloading Decision (TPPD) algorithm for analyzing the historical trajectories of vehicles to predict their future coordinates, thereby allowing for computational resource allocation in advance. We first utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict each vehicle's movement trajectory. Then, based on the task requirements and the predicted trajectories, we devise a dynamic resource allocation algorithm using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) that enables the edge server to minimize task processing delay, while ensuring effective utilization of the available computational resources. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing that, as compared with traditional real-time task offloading strategies, the proposed TPPD algorithm significantly reduces task processing delay while improving resource utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Trajectory Prediction via Coreset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a data-driven learning framework, that leverages the predictive and feature extraction capabilities of the mixture models and seq2seq-based neural networks while addressing prevalent challenges caused by error propagation and dimensionality reduction. After training with this framework, the learned model can improve long-step prediction accuracy significantly given the past trajectories and the context information. The accuracy and effectiveness of the approach are evaluated by comparing the predicted trajectories with the ground truth. The results indicate that the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art predicting methods on a terminal airspace flight trajectory dataset. The trajectories generated by the proposed method have a higher temporal resolution(1 timestep per second vs 0.1 timestep per second) and are closer to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AIAA-JAIS</p></details> |

Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15586v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

| **[Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15182v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving, as it significantly affects vehicle behavior planning and control, thereby influencing traffic safety and efficiency. Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack</p></details> |

However, this convenience comes with a trade-off: a substantial rise in fraudulent activities. Traditional machine learning methods for fraud detection often struggle to capture the inherent interconnectedness within financial data. This paper proposes a novel approach for credit card fraud detection that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms applied to heterogeneous graph representations of financial data. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs capture intricate relationships between various entities in the financial ecosystem, such as cardholders, merchants, and transactions, providing a richer and more comprehensive data representation for fraud analysis. To address the inherent class imbalance in fraud data, where genuine transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones, the proposed approach integrates an autoencoder. This autoencoder, trained on genuine transactions, learns a latent representation and flags deviations during reconstruction as potential fraud. This research investigates two key questions: (1) How effectively can a GNN with an attention mechanism detect and prevent credit card fraud when applied to a heterogeneous graph? (2) How does the efficacy of the autoencoder with attention approach compare to traditional methods? The results are promising, demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms benchmark algorithms such as Graph Sage and FI-GRL, achieving a superior AUC-PR of 0.89 and an F1-score of 0.81. This research significantly advances fraud detection systems and the overall security of financial transactions by leveraging GNNs with attention mechanisms and addressing class imbalance through an autoencoder.</p></details> |  |

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks. EG-XC combines semi-local functionals with a non-local feature density parametrized by an equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud representation of the electron density to capture long-range interactions. By differentiating through a self-consistent field solver, we train EG-XC requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> |  |

These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, after reviewing existing adapters, we find they generally fail to fully explore the interactions between different modalities in constructing task-specific knowledge. Also, existing works usually only focus on similarity matching between positive text prompts, making it challenging to distinguish the classes with high similar visual contents. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Adapter to achieve tuning VLMs for the downstream tasks. To be specific, we first construct a unified heterogeneous graph mode, which contains i) visual nodes, positive text nodes and negative text nodes, and ii) several types of edge connections to comprehensively model the intra-modality, inter-modality and inter-class structure knowledge together. Next, we employ a specific Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to excavate multi-modality structure knowledge for adapting both visual and textual features for the downstream tasks. Finally, after HeGraphAdapter, we construct both text-based and visual-based classifiers simultaneously to comprehensively enhance the performance of the CLIP model. Experimental results on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed HeGraphAdapter.</p></details> |  |

While the expressivity of GNNs, particularly their equivalence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) isomorphism test, has been well-documented, understanding their generalization capabilities remains critical. This paper focuses on the generalization of GNNs by investigating their Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We extend previous results to demonstrate that 1-dimensional GNNs with a single parameter have an infinite VC dimension for unbounded graphs. Furthermore, we show that this also holds for GNNs using analytic non-polynomial activation functions, including the 1-dimensional GNNs that were recently shown to be as expressive as the 1-WL test. These results suggest inherent limitations in the generalization ability of even the most simple GNNs, when viewed from the VC dimension perspective.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We prove that the graph queries that can be computed by a polynomial-size bounded-depth family of GNNs are exactly those definable in the guarded fragment GFO+C of first-order logic with counting and with built-in relations. This puts GNNs in the circuit complexity class (non-uniform) TC^0. Remarkably, the GNN families may use arbitrary real weights and a wide class of activation functions that includes the standard ReLU, logistic "sigmod", and hyperbolic tangent functions. If the GNNs are allowed to use random initialisation and global readout (both standard features of GNNs widely used in practice), they can compute exactly the same queries as bounded depth Boolean circuits with threshold gates, that is, exactly the queries in TC^0. Moreover, we show that queries computable by a single GNN with piecewise linear activations and rational weights are definable in GFO+C without built-in relations. Therefore, they are contained in uniform TC^0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable and Certifiable Graph Unlearning: Overcoming the Approximation Error Barrier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09212v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal research area for ensuring privacy protection, given the widespread adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in applications involving sensitive user data. Among existing studies, certified graph unlearning is distinguished by providing robust privacy guarantees. However, current certified graph unlearning methods are impractical for large-scale graphs because they necessitate the costly re-computation of graph propagation for each unlearning request. Although numerous scalable techniques have been developed to accelerate graph propagation for GNNs, their integration into certified graph unlearning remains uncertain as these scalable approaches introduce approximation errors into node embeddings. In contrast, certified graph unlearning demands bounded model error on exact node embeddings to maintain its certified guarantee. To address this challenge, we present ScaleGUN, the first approach to scale certified graph unlearning to billion-edge graphs. ScaleGUN integrates the approximate graph propagation technique into certified graph unlearning, offering certified guarantees for three unlearning scenarios: node feature, edge, and node unlearning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and unlearning efficacy of ScaleGUN. Remarkably, ScaleGUN accomplishes $(\epsilon,\delta)=(1,10^{-4})$ certified unlearning on the billion-edge graph ogbn-papers100M in 20 seconds for a 5,000 random edge removal request -- of which only 5 seconds are required for updating the node embeddings -- compared to 1.91 hours for retraining and 1.89 hours for re-propagation.

| **[Generalizable Indoor Human Activity Recognition Method Based on Micro-Doppler Corner Point Cloud and Dynamic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07542v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Through-the-wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition can be achieved by fusing micro-Doppler signature extraction and intelligent decision-making algorithms. However, limited by the insufficient priori of tester in practical indoor scenarios, the trained models on one tester are commonly difficult to inference well on other testers, which causes poor generalization ability. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a generalizable indoor human activity recognition method based on micro-Doppler corner point cloud and dynamic graph learning. In the proposed method, DoG-{\mu}D-CornerDet is used for micro-Doppler corner extraction on two types of radar profiles. Then, a micro-Doppler corner filtering method based on polynomial fitting smoothing is proposed to maximize the feature distance under the constraints of the kinematic model. The extracted corners from the two types of radar profiles are concatenated together into three-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the paper proposes a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN)-based recognition method for data-to-activity label mapping. Visualization, comparison and ablation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results prove that the proposed method has strong generalization ability on radar data collected from different testers.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables, in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronics Systems, 2024</p></details> |

We show that certain measures on the spectrum of the empirical neural tangent kernel, specifically entropy and trace, yield insight into the representations learned by a neural network and how these can be improved through architecture scaling. These results are demonstrated first on test cases before being shown on more complex networks, including transformers, auto-encoders, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning studies. In testing on a wide range of architectures, we highlight the universal nature of training dynamics and further discuss how it can be used to understand the mechanisms behind learning in neural networks. We identify two such dominant mechanisms present throughout machine learning training. The first, information compression, is seen through a reduction in the entropy of the NTK spectrum during training, and occurs predominantly in small neural networks. The second, coined structure formation, is seen through an increasing entropy and thus, the creation of structure in the neural network representations beyond the prior established by the network at initialization. Due to the ubiquity of the latter in deep neural network architectures and its flexibility in the creation of feature-rich representations, we argue that this form of evolution of the network's entropy be considered the onset of a deep learning regime.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[On the Hölder Stability of Multiset and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06984v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an innovative methodology for detecting and predicting collusion patterns in different national markets using neural networks (NNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs are particularly well suited to this task because they can exploit the inherent network structures present in collusion and many other economic problems. Our approach consists of two phases: In Phase I, we develop and train models on individual market datasets from Japan, the United States, two regions in Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil, focusing on predicting collusion in single markets. In Phase II, we extend the models' applicability through zero-shot learning, employing a transfer learning approach that can detect collusion in markets in which training data is unavailable. This phase also incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to evaluate the models' performance on unseen datasets from other countries and regions. In our empirical study, we show that GNNs outperform NNs in detecting complex collusive patterns. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on preventing collusion and optimizing detection methodologies, providing valuable guidance on the use of NNs and GNNs in economic applications to enhance market fairness and economic welfare.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN's superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGMAN: Stability Analysis of Graph Neural Networks on the Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08653v4)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern graph neural networks (GNNs) can be sensitive to changes in the input graph structure and node features, potentially resulting in unpredictable behavior and degraded performance. In this work, we introduce a spectral framework known as SAGMAN for examining the stability of GNNs. This framework assesses the distance distortions that arise from the nonlinear mappings of GNNs between the input and output manifolds: when two nearby nodes on the input manifold are mapped (through a GNN model) to two distant ones on the output manifold, it implies a large distance distortion and thus a poor GNN stability. We propose a distance-preserving graph dimension reduction (GDR) approach that utilizes spectral graph embedding and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to create low-dimensional input/output graph-based manifolds for meaningful stability analysis. Our empirical evaluations show that SAGMAN effectively assesses the stability of each node when subjected to various edge or feature perturbations, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the stability of GNNs, extending to applications within recommendation systems. Furthermore, we illustrate its utility in downstream tasks, notably in enhancing GNN stability and facilitating adversarial targeted attacks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaRC: Mitigating Graph Structure Shifts during Test-Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06976v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Powerful as they are, graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to distribution shifts. Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has attracted attention due to its ability to adapt a pre-trained model to a target domain without re-accessing the source domain. However, existing TTA algorithms are primarily designed for attribute shifts in vision tasks, where samples are independent. These methods perform poorly on graph data that experience structure shifts, where node connectivity differs between source and target graphs. We attribute this performance gap to the distinct impact of node attribute shifts versus graph structure shifts: the latter significantly degrades the quality of node representations and blurs the boundaries between different node categories. To address structure shifts in graphs, we propose AdaRC, an innovative framework designed for effective and efficient adaptation to structure shifts by adjusting the hop-aggregation parameters in GNNs. To enhance the representation quality, we design a prediction-informed clustering loss to encourage the formation of distinct clusters for different node categories. Additionally, AdaRC seamlessly integrates with existing TTA algorithms, allowing it to handle attribute shifts effectively while improving overall performance under combined structure and attribute shifts. We validate the effectiveness of AdaRC on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its robustness across various combinations of structure and attribute shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLGNet: Hyperedge Classification through Directed Line Graphs for Chemical Reactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06969v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs and hypergraphs provide powerful abstractions for modeling interactions among a set of entities of interest and have been attracting a growing interest in the literature thanks to many successful applications in several fields. In particular, they are rapidly expanding in domains such as chemistry and biology, especially in the areas of drug discovery and molecule generation. One of the areas witnessing the fasted growth is the chemical reactions field, where chemical reactions can be naturally encoded as directed hyperedges of a hypergraph. In this paper, we address the chemical reaction classification problem by introducing the notation of a Directed Line Graph (DGL) associated with a given directed hypergraph. On top of it, we build the Directed Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG transformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the Directed Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of the interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph thanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many desirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being positive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a spectral-based GNN. Through extensive experiments on chemical reaction datasets, we show that DGLNet significantly outperforms the existing approaches, achieving on a collection of real-world datasets an average relative-percentage-difference improvement of 33.01%, with a maximum improvement of 37.71%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faithful Interpretation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06950v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, attention mechanisms have garnered increasing attention in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Transformers (GTs). It is not only due to the commendable boost in performance they offer but also its capacity to provide a more lucid rationale for model behaviors, which are often viewed as inscrutable. However, Attention-based GNNs have demonstrated instability in interpretability when subjected to various sources of perturbations during both training and testing phases, including factors like additional edges or nodes. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing a novel notion called Faithful Graph Attention-based Interpretation (FGAI). In particular, FGAI has four crucial properties regarding stability and sensitivity to interpretation and final output distribution. Built upon this notion, we propose an efficient methodology for obtaining FGAI, which can be viewed as an ad hoc modification to the canonical Attention-based GNNs. To validate our proposed solution, we introduce two novel metrics tailored for graph interpretation assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that FGAI exhibits superior stability and preserves the interpretability of attention under various forms of perturbations and randomness, which makes FGAI a more faithful and reliable explanation tool.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings.

| **[RoCP-GNN: Robust Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Networks in Node-Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13825v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data. However, a notable limitation of GNNs is their inability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, which undermines their reliability in contexts where errors are costly. One way to address this issue is by providing prediction sets that contain the true label with a predefined probability margin. Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals. There are two primary challenges: first, given dependent data like graphs, it is unclear whether the critical assumption in CP - exchangeability - still holds when applied to node classification. Second, even if the exchangeability assumption is valid for conformalized link prediction, we need to ensure high efficiency, i.e., the resulting prediction set or the interval length is small enough to provide useful information. In this article, we propose a novel approach termed Robust Conformal Prediction for GNNs (RoCP-GNN), which integrates conformal prediction (CP) directly into the GNN training process. This method generates prediction sets, instead of just point predictions, that are valid at a user-defined confidence level, assuming only exchangeability. Our approach robustly predicts outcomes with any predictive GNN model while quantifying the uncertainty in predictions within the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models with size loss provide a statistically significant increase in performance. We validate our approach on standard graph benchmark datasets by coupling it with various state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification. The code will be made available after publication.</p></details> | 12, 6 figures |

And program error diagnosis can often be too abstract or technical for developers to understand, especially for beginners. The goal of this paper is to present a novel machine-learning approach for Multi-task Program Error Repair and Explanatory Diagnosis (mPRED). A pre-trained language model is used to encode the source code, and a downstream model is specifically designed to identify and repair errors. Programs and test cases will be augmented and optimized from several perspectives. Additionally, our approach incorporates a "chain of thoughts" method, which enables the models to produce intermediate reasoning explanations before providing the final correction. To aid in visualizing and analyzing the program structure, we use a graph neural network for program structure visualization. Overall, our approach offers a promising approach for repairing program errors across different programming languages and providing helpful explanations to programmers.</p></details> |  |

However, many complex systems--such as biological or social networks--involve multiway complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological spaces. The emerging field of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) aims to accommodate and leverage these higher-order structures. Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs), fairly general TDL models, have been shown to be more expressive and better performing than GNNs. However, differently from the graph deep learning ecosystem, TDL lacks a principled and standardized framework for easily defining new architectures, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a novel simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software that allows practitioners to define, build, and train GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.</p></details> |  |

However, DGRL remains relatively unexplored, especially in the hardware domain, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive and user-friendly benchmarks. This study presents a novel benchmark comprising five hardware design datasets and 13 prediction tasks spanning various levels of circuit abstraction. We evaluate 21 DGRL models, employing diverse graph neural networks and graph transformers (GTs) as backbones, enhanced by positional encodings (PEs) tailored for directed graphs. Our results highlight that bidirected (BI) message passing neural networks (MPNNs) and robust PEs significantly enhance model performance. Notably, the top-performing models include PE-enhanced GTs interleaved with BI-MPNN layers and BI-Graph Isomorphism Network, both surpassing baselines across the 13 tasks. Additionally, our investigation into out-of-distribution (OOD) performance emphasizes the urgent need to improve OOD generalization in DGRL models. This benchmark, implemented with a modular codebase, streamlines the evaluation of DGRL models for both hardware and ML practitioners</p></details> |  |

Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion. For this, the task's loss function does not have to be differentiable. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.</p></details> |  |

It must achieve high accuracy within the constraints of molecular mechanics' (MM) limited functional forms, which offers high computational efficiency. With the rapid expansion of synthetically accessible chemical space, traditional look-up table approaches face significant challenges. In this study, we address this issue using a modern data-driven approach, developing ByteFF, an Amber-compatible force field for drug-like molecules. To create ByteFF, we generated an expansive and highly diverse molecular dataset at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/DZVP level of theory. This dataset includes 2.4 million optimized molecular fragment geometries with analytical Hessian matrices, along with 3.2 million torsion profiles. We then trained an edge-augmented, symmetry-preserving molecular graph neural network (GNN) on this dataset, employing a carefully optimized training strategy. Our model predicts all bonded and non-bonded MM force field parameters for drug-like molecules simultaneously across a broad chemical space. ByteFF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, excelling in predicting relaxed geometries, torsional energy profiles, and conformational energies and forces. Its exceptional accuracy and expansive chemical space coverage make ByteFF a valuable tool for multiple stages of computational drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>ByteF...</summary><p>ByteFF, a machine learning parametrized MMFF.

Motivated by the recent success of Vision transformers (ViT) in various computer vision tasks, we propose an unsupervised segmentation framework with a pre-trained ViT. Moreover, by harnessing the graph structure inherent within the image, the proposed method achieves a notable performance in segmentation, especially in medical images. We further introduce a modularity-based loss function coupled with an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) filter to capture the inherent graph topology within the image. Finally, we observe that employing Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) and SILU (Swish) activation functions within the proposed Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture enhances the performance of segmentation. The proposed method provides state-of-the-art performance (even comparable to supervised methods) on benchmark image segmentation datasets such as ECSSD, DUTS, and CUB, as well as challenging medical image segmentation datasets such as KVASIR, CVC-ClinicDB, ISIC-2018.

| **[Clarify Confused Nodes via Separated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02285v4)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods.

Initially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error accumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention mechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of diffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at the forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In this paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space Models (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically, we utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like mechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that integrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to achieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these architectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present Time series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models (TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios and performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value situations and three real-world datasets. We also evaluate how the performance of our model varies with different amounts of missing values and analyse its performance on downstream tasks.

While both traditional and learning-based registration approaches have succeeded, leveraging the intrinsic symmetry of point cloud data, including rotation equivariance, has received insufficient attention. This prohibits the model from learning effectively, resulting in a requirement for more training data and increased model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a graph neural network model embedded with a local Spherical Euclidean 3D equivariance property through SE(3) message passing based propagation. Our model is composed mainly of a descriptor module, equivariant graph layers, match similarity, and the final regression layers. Such modular design enables us to utilize sparsely sampled input points and initialize the descriptor by self-trained or pre-trained geometric feature descriptors easily. Experiments conducted on the 3DMatch and KITTI datasets exhibit the compelling and robust performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while the model complexity remains relatively low at the same time.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 ma...</summary><p>18 main body pages, and 9 pages for supplementary part</p></details> |

Usually, a comprehensive hyperparameter tuning is essential for fully unlocking GNN's top performance, especially for complicated tasks such as node classification on large graphs and long-range graphs. This is usually associated with high computational and time costs and careful design of appropriate search spaces. This work introduces a graph-conditioned latent diffusion framework (GNN-Diff) to generate high-performing GNNs based on the model checkpoints of sub-optimal hyperparameters selected by a light-tuning coarse search. We validate our method through 166 experiments across four graph tasks: node classification on small, large, and long-range graphs, as well as link prediction. Our experiments involve 10 classic and state-of-the-art target models and 20 publicly available datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that GNN-Diff: (1) boosts the performance of GNNs with efficient hyperparameter tuning; and (2) presents high stability and generalizability on unseen data across multiple generation runs.

Recent studies have drawn analogies between GNN feature propagation and diffusion processes, which can be interpreted as dynamical systems. In this paper, we delve deeper into this perspective by connecting the dynamics in GNNs to modern Koopman theory and its numerical method, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). We illustrate how DMD can estimate a low-rank, finite-dimensional linear operator based on multiple states of the system, effectively approximating potential nonlinear interactions between nodes in the graph. This approach allows us to capture complex dynamics within the graph accurately and efficiently. We theoretically establish a connection between the DMD-estimated operator and the original dynamic operator between system states. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a family of DMD-GNN models that effectively leverage the low-rank eigenfunctions provided by the DMD algorithm. We further discuss the potential of enhancing our approach by incorporating domain-specific constraints such as symmetry into the DMD computation, allowing the corresponding GNN models to respect known physical properties of the underlying system. Our work paves the path for applying advanced dynamical system analysis tools via GNNs. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various learning tasks, including directed graphs, large-scale graphs, long-range interactions, and spatial-temporal graphs. We also empirically verify that our proposed models can serve as powerful encoders for link prediction tasks. The results demonstrate that our DMD-enhanced GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating DMD into GNN frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Group-convolutional architectures, which encode symmetries as inductive bias, have shown great success in applications, but can suffer from instabilities as their depth increases and often struggle to learn long range dependencies in data. For instance, graph neural networks experience instability due to the convergence of node representations (over-smoothing), which can occur after only a few iterations of message-passing, reducing their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Here, we propose and study unitary group convolutions, which allow for deeper networks that are more stable during training. The main focus of the paper are graph neural networks, where we show that unitary graph convolutions provably avoid over-smoothing. Our experimental results confirm that unitary graph convolutional networks achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art graph neural networks. We complement our analysis of the graph domain with the study of general unitary convolutions and analyze their role in enhancing stability in general group convolutional architectures.</p></details> |  |

A class of promising GNN training algorithms take advantage of historical embeddings to reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining the model expressiveness of GNNs. However, they incur significant computation bias due to the stale feature history. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their staleness and inferior performance on large-scale problems. Motivated by our discoveries, we propose a simple yet highly effective training algorithm (REST) to effectively reduce feature staleness, which leads to significantly improved performance and convergence across varying batch sizes. The proposed algorithm seamlessly integrates with existing solutions, boasting easy implementation, while comprehensive experiments underscore its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks. Specifically, our improvements to state-of-the-art historical embedding methods result in a 2.7% and 3.6% performance enhancement on the ogbn-papers100M and ogbn-products dataset respectively, accompanied by notably accelerated convergence.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches utilize graph neural networks (GNNs)to capture both user profle and structural features,achieving promising progress. However, they still face limitations including the expensive training on large underlying graph, the performance degration when similar neighborhood patterns' assumption preferred by GNNs is not satisfied, and the dynamic features of bots in a highly adversarial context. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method named BSG4Bot with an intuition that GNNs training on Biased SubGraphs can improve both performance and time/space efficiency in bot detection. Specifically, BSG4Bot first pre-trains a classifier on node features efficiently to define the node similarities, and constructs biased subgraphs by combining the similarities computed by the pre-trained classifier and the node importances computed by Personalized PageRank (PPR scores). BSG4Bot then introduces a heterogeneous GNN over the constructed subgraphs to detect bots effectively and efficiently. The relatively stable features, including the content category and temporal activity features, are explored and incorporated into BSG4Bot after preliminary verification on sample data. The extensive experimental studies show that BSG4Bot outperforms the state-of-the-art bot detection methods, while only needing nearly 1/5 training time.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, graph transformers (GTs) enable global information exchange but often oversimplify the graph structure by representing graphs as sets of fixed-length vectors. This work introduces a novel architecture that overcomes the shortcomings of both approaches by combining the long-range information of random walks with local message passing. By treating random walks as sequences, our architecture leverages recent advances in sequence models to effectively capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures.

| **[Taming Gradient Oversmoothing and Expansion in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04824v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing has been claimed as a primary bottleneck for multi-layered graph neural networks (GNNs). Multiple analyses have examined how and why oversmoothing occurs. However, none of the prior work addressed how optimization is performed under the oversmoothing regime. In this work, we show the presence of $\textit{gradient oversmoothing}$ preventing optimization during training. We further analyze that GNNs with residual connections, a well-known solution to help gradient flow in deep architecture, introduce $\textit{gradient expansion}$, a phenomenon of the gradient explosion in diverse directions. Therefore, adding residual connections cannot be a solution for making a GNN deep. Our analysis reveals that constraining the Lipschitz bound of each layer can neutralize the gradient expansion. To this end, we provide a simple yet effective normalization method to prevent the gradient expansion. An empirical study shows that the residual GNNs with hundreds of layers can be efficiently trained with the proposed normalization without compromising performance. Additional studies show that the empirical observations corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, addressing the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) effectively becomes increasingly essential. The AC-OPF, which is a fundamental optimization problem in power systems, must be solved more frequently to ensure the safe and cost-effective operation of power systems. Due to its non-linear nature, AC-OPF is often solved in its linearized form, despite inherent inaccuracies. Non-linear solvers, such as the interior point method, are typically employed to solve the full OPF problem. However, these iterative methods may not converge for large systems and do not guarantee global optimality. This work explores a physics-informed graph neural network, PINCO, to solve the AC-OPF. We demonstrate that this method provides accurate solutions in a fraction of the computational time when compared to the established non-linear programming solvers. Remarkably, PINCO generalizes effectively across a diverse set of loading conditions in the power system. We show that our method can solve the AC-OPF without violating inequality constraints. Furthermore, it can function both as a solver and as a hybrid universal function approximator. Moreover, the approach can be easily adapted to different power systems with minimal adjustments to the hyperparameters, including systems with multiple generators at each bus. Overall, this work demonstrates an advancement in the field of power system optimization to tackle the challenges of the energy transition.

However, the development of diverse, high-quality datasets for structural analysis remains a challenge. Traditional datasets, like the jet engine bracket dataset, are limited by small sample sizes, hindering the creation of robust surrogate models. This study introduces the DeepJEB dataset, generated through deep generative models and automated simulation pipelines, to address these limitations. DeepJEB offers comprehensive 3D geometries and corresponding structural analysis data. Key experiments validated its effectiveness, showing significant improvements in surrogate model performance. Models trained on DeepJEB achieved up to a 23% increase in the coefficient of determination and over a 70% reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to those trained on traditional datasets. These results underscore the superior generalization capabilities of DeepJEB. By supporting advanced modeling techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), DeepJEB enables more accurate predictions in structural performance.

| **[When GDD meets GNN: A Knowledge-driven Neural Connection for Effective Entity Resolution in Property Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04783v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the entity resolution (ER) problem in property graphs. ER is the task of identifying and linking different records that refer to the same real-world entity. It is commonly used in data integration, data cleansing, and other applications where it is important to have accurate and consistent data. In general, two predominant approaches exist in the literature: rule-based and learning-based methods. On the one hand, rule-based techniques are often desired due to their explainability and ability to encode domain knowledge. Learning-based methods, on the other hand, are preferred due to their effectiveness in spite of their black-box nature. In this work, we devise a hybrid ER solution, GraphER, that leverages the strengths of both systems for property graphs. In particular, we adopt graph differential dependency (GDD) for encoding the so-called record-matching rules, and employ them to guide a graph neural network (GNN) based representation learning for the task. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation of our proposal on benchmark ER datasets including 17 graph datasets and 7 relational datasets in comparison with 10 state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. The results show that our approach provides a significantly better solution to addressing ER in graph data, both quantitatively and qualitatively, while attaining highly competitive results on the benchmark relational datasets w.r.t. the SOTA solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Clifford Algebraic Approach to E(n)-Equivariant High-order Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04692v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing neural network architectures that can handle data symmetry is crucial. This is especially important for geometric graphs whose properties are equivariance under Euclidean transformations. Current equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), particularly those using message passing, have a limitation in expressive power. Recent high-order graph neural networks can overcome this limitation, yet they lack equivariance properties, representing a notable drawback in certain applications in chemistry and physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce the Clifford Group Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (CG-EGNNs), a novel EGNN that enhances high-order message passing by integrating high-order local structures in the context of Clifford algebras. As a key benefit of using Clifford algebras, CG-EGNN can learn functions that capture equivariance from positional features. By adopting the high-order message passing mechanism, CG-EGNN gains richer information from neighbors, thus improving model performance. Furthermore, we establish the universality property of the $k$-hop message passing framework, showcasing greater expressive power of CG-EGNNs with additional $k$-hop message passing mechanism. We empirically validate that CG-EGNNs outperform previous methods on various benchmarks including n-body, CMU motion capture, and MD17, highlighting their effectiveness in geometric deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FARM: Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02082v2)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into the representations. This strategic reduction in tokenization granularity is intentionally aligned with key drivers of functional properties (i.e., functional groups), enhancing the model's understanding of chemical language. By expanding the chemical lexicon, FARM more effectively bridges SMILES and natural language, ultimately advancing the model's capacity to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and by employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. By leveraging contrastive learning, FARM aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning, with promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, much work remains to be done to improve the generalization ability, accuracy, and inference time for critical applications. The traditional machine learning models predict properties based on the features extracted from the molecules, which are often not easily available. In this work, a novel Deep Learning method, the Edge Conditioned Residual Graph Neural Network (ECRGNN), has been applied, allowing us to predict properties directly only the Graph-based structures of the molecules. SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation of the molecules has been used in the present study as input data format, which has been further converted into a graph database, which constitutes the training data. This manuscript highlights a detailed description of the novel GRU-based methodology, ECRGNN, to map the inputs that have been used. Emphasis is placed on highlighting both the regressive property and the classification efficacy of the same. A detailed description of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and the end-to-end learning method used for multi-class multi-label property prediction has been provided as well. The results have been compared with standard benchmark datasets as well as some newly developed datasets.

Understanding these algorithms is essential but challenging due to the complex, distributed nature of social media networks as well as limited access to real-world data. This study proposes to use academic social networks as a proxy for investigating recommendation systems in social media. By employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we develop a model that separates the prediction of academic infosphere from behavior prediction, allowing us to simulate recommender-generated infospheres and assess the model's performance in predicting future co-authorships. Our approach aims to improve our understanding of recommendation systems' roles and social networks modeling.

In this work, we propose a framework that achieves the aforementioned by generating semantically edited inputs, known as counterfactual interventions, which change the model prediction, thus providing a form of counterfactual explanations for the model. We test our framework on two NLP tasks - binary sentiment classification and topic classification - and show that the generated edits are contrastive, fluent and minimal, while the whole process remains significantly faster that other state-of-the-art counterfactual editors.</p></details> |  |

We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. Under the hood, gRNAde is a multi-state Graph Neural Network that generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. [2010], gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent ribozyme.

This condensed graph has shown promise in accelerating graph neural networks while preserving performance comparable to those achieved with the original, larger graphs. Additionally, this technique facilitates downstream applications like neural architecture search and deepens our understanding of redundancies in large graphs. Despite the rapid development of GC methods, particularly for node classification, a unified evaluation framework is still lacking to systematically compare different GC methods or clarify key design choices for improving their effectiveness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{GC4NC}, a comprehensive framework for evaluating diverse GC methods on node classification across multiple dimensions including performance, efficiency, privacy preservation, denoising ability, NAS effectiveness, and transferability. Our systematic evaluation offers novel insights into how condensed graphs behave and the critical design choices that drive their success. These findings pave the way for future advancements in GC methods, enhancing both performance and expanding their real-world applications.

However, existing models typically sacrifice either accuracy or efficiency. Moreover, lightweight models are highly demanded for offering simulating systems on a considerably larger scale at reduced computational costs. Here, we introduce a lightweight equivariant interaction graph neural network (LEIGNN) that can enable accurate and efficient interatomic potential and force predictions for molecules and crystals. Rather than relying on higher-order representations, LEIGNN employs a scalar-vector dual representation to encode equivariant features. By learning geometric symmetry information, our model remains lightweight while ensuring prediction accuracy and robustness through the equivariance. Our results show that LEIGNN consistently outperforms the prediction performance of the representative baselines and achieves significant efficiency across diverse datasets, which include catalysts, molecules, and organic isomers. Furthermore, we conduct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the LEIGNN force field across solid, liquid, and gas systems. It is found that LEIGNN can achieve the accuracy of \textit{ab initio} MD across all examined systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Impact of Local Homophily on GNN Fairness: In-Depth Analysis and New Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04287v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to generalize when graphs exhibit both homophily (same-class connections) and heterophily (different-class connections). Specifically, GNNs tend to underperform for nodes with local homophily levels that differ significantly from the global homophily level. This issue poses a risk in user-centric applications where underrepresented homophily levels are present. Concurrently, fairness within GNNs has received substantial attention due to the potential amplification of biases via message passing. However, the connection between local homophily and fairness in GNNs remains underexplored. In this work, we move beyond global homophily and explore how local homophily levels can lead to unfair predictions. We begin by formalizing the challenge of fair predictions for underrepresented homophily levels as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. We then conduct a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how local homophily levels can alter predictions for differing sensitive attributes. We additionally introduce three new GNN fairness benchmarks, as well as a novel semi-synthetic graph generator, to empirically study the OOD problem. Across extensive analysis we find that two factors can promote unfairness: (a) OOD distance, and (b) heterophilous nodes situated in homophilous graphs. In cases where these two conditions are met, fairness drops by up to 24% on real world datasets, and 30% in semi-synthetic datasets. Together, our theoretical insights, empirical analysis, and algorithmic contributions unveil a previously overlooked source of unfairness rooted in the graph's homophily information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Applying Hybrid Graph Neural Networks to Strengthen Credit Risk Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04283v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to credit risk prediction by employing Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. Leveraging the power of big data and artificial intelligence, the proposed method addresses the challenges faced by traditional credit risk assessment models, particularly in handling imbalanced datasets and extracting meaningful features from complex relationships. The paper begins by transforming raw borrower data into graph-structured data, where borrowers and their relationships are represented as nodes and edges, respectively. A classic subgraph convolutional model is then applied to extract local features, followed by the introduction of a hybrid GCNN model that integrates both local and global convolutional operators to capture a comprehensive representation of node features. The hybrid model incorporates an attention mechanism to adaptively select features, mitigating issues of over-smoothing and insufficient feature consideration. The study demonstrates the potential of GCNNs in improving the accuracy of credit risk prediction, offering a robust solution for financial institutions seeking to enhance their lending decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-omics data integration poses significant challenges due to the high dimensionality, data complexity, and distinct characteristics of various omics types. This study addresses these challenges and evaluates three graph neural network architectures for multi-omics (MO) integration based on graph-convolutional networks (GCN), graph-attention networks (GAT), and graph-transformer networks (GTN) for classifying 31 cancer types and normal tissues. To address the high-dimensionality of multi-omics data, we employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression for feature selection, leading to the creation of LASSO-MOGCN, LASSO-MOGAT, and LASSO-MOTGN models. Graph structures for the networks were constructed using gene correlation matrices and protein-protein interaction networks for multi-omics integration of messenger-RNA, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation data. Such data integration enables the networks to dynamically focus on important relationships between biological entities, improving both model performance and interpretability. Among the models, LASSO-MOGAT with a correlation-based graph structure achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (95.9%) and outperformed the LASSO-MOGCN and LASSO-MOTGN models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings demonstrate that integrating multi-omics data in graph-based architectures enhances cancer classification performance by uncovering distinct molecular patterns that contribute to a better understanding of cancer biology and potential biomarkers for disease progression.</p></details> |  |

For two different graphs with the same number of nodes, our framework leverages a spectral graph matching procedure to find node correspondence so that the geodesic distance between them can be subsequently computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem associated with their Laplacian matrices. For graphs with different sizes, a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme is introduced to reduce the size of the bigger graph while preserving the original spectral properties. We show that the proposed GGD metric can effectively quantify dissimilarities between two graphs by encapsulating their differences in key structural (spectral) properties, such as effective resistances between nodes, cuts, the mixing time of random walks, etc. Through extensive experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art metrics, such as the latest Tree-Mover's Distance (TMD) metric, the proposed GGD metric shows significantly improved performance for stability evaluation of GNNs especially when only partial node features are available.</p></details> |  |

Although previous methods have demonstrated the importance of relative encodings for effective temporal link prediction, computational efficiency remains a major concern in constructing these encodings. Moreover, existing relative encodings are usually constructed based on structural connectivity, where temporal information is seldom considered. To address the aforementioned issues, we first analyze existing relative encodings and unify them as a function of temporal walk matrices. This unification establishes a connection between relative encodings and temporal walk matrices, providing a more principled way for analyzing and designing relative encodings. Based on this analysis, we propose a new temporal graph neural network called TPNet, which introduces a temporal walk matrix that incorporates the time decay effect to simultaneously consider both temporal and structural information. Moreover, TPNet designs a random feature propagation mechanism with theoretical guarantees to implicitly maintain the temporal walk matrices, which improves the computation and storage efficiency. Experimental results on 13 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TPNet, where TPNet outperforms other baselines on most datasets and achieves a maximum speedup of $33.3 \times$ compared to the SOTA baseline.

In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances the efficiency of these methods by utilizing low-discrepancy distributions generated through Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC). MPMC leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate point sets that uniformly cover the space, with uniformity assessed using the the $\cL_p$-discrepancy measure, which quantifies the irregularity of sample distributions. By improving the uniformity of the point sets, our approach significantly reduces computational overhead and the number of samples required for solving motion planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional sampling techniques in terms of planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first propose \emph{generalized folklore Weisfeiler-Leman (GFWL)} algorithms as a flexible design basis for expressive GNNs, and then provide a theoretical framework to algorithmically determine the homomorphism counting power of an arbitrary class of GNN within the GFWL design space. As the considered design space is large enough to accommodate almost all known powerful GNNs, our result greatly extends all existing works, and may find its application in the automation of GNN model design.</p></details> |  |

Our experimental analysis demonstrates our approach's superiority in accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we speed up the prior state-of-the-art by more than $100\times$ on the benchmark datasets while maintaining an error rate below $0.1\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on IEEE VIS 2024 with Best Paper Award</p></details> |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |

To address this problem, prior work suggests rewiring the graph structure to improve information flow. Alternatively, a significant body of research has dedicated itself to discovering and precomputing bottleneck-free graph structures to ameliorate over-squashing. One well regarded family of bottleneck-free graphs within the mathematical community are expander graphs, with prior work$\unicode{x2014}$Expander Graph Propagation (EGP)$\unicode{x2014}$proposing the use of a well-known expander graph family$\unicode{x2014}$the Cayley graphs of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ special linear group$\unicode{x2014}$as a computational template for GNNs. However, in EGP the computational graphs used are truncated to align with a given input graph. In this work, we show that truncation is detrimental to the coveted expansion properties. Instead, we propose CGP, a method to propagate information over a complete Cayley graph structure, thereby ensuring it is bottleneck-free to better alleviate over-squashing. Our empirical evidence across several real-world datasets not only shows that CGP recovers significant improvements as compared to EGP, but it is also akin to or outperforms computationally complex graph rewiring techniques.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, ROMs provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Are Good Positional Encodings for Directed Graphs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20912v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positional encodings (PEs) are essential for building powerful and expressive graph neural networks and graph transformers, as they effectively capture the relative spatial relationships between nodes. Although extensive research has been devoted to PEs in undirected graphs, PEs for directed graphs remain relatively unexplored. This work seeks to address this gap. We first introduce the notion of Walk Profile, a generalization of walk-counting sequences for directed graphs. A walk profile encompasses numerous structural features crucial for directed graph-relevant applications, such as program analysis and circuit performance prediction. We identify the limitations of existing PE methods in representing walk profiles and propose a novel Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian PE, which extends the Magnetic Laplacian eigenvector-based PE by incorporating multiple potential factors. The new PE can provably express walk profiles. Furthermore, we generalize prior basis-invariant neural networks to enable the stable use of the new PE in the complex domain. Our numerical experiments validate the expressiveness of the proposed PEs and demonstrate their effectiveness in solving sorting network satisfiability and performing well on general circuit benchmarks.

| **[Verbalized Graph Representation Learning: A Fully Interpretable Graph Model Based on Large Language Models Throughout the Entire Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01457v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has attracted significant interest due to its wide-ranging real-world applications, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Traditional GNN methods focus on encoding the structural information of graphs, often using shallow text embeddings for node or edge attributes. This limits the model to understand the rich semantic information in the data and its reasoning ability for complex downstream tasks, while also lacking interpretability. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), an increasing number of studies are combining them with GNNs for graph representation learning and downstream tasks. While these approaches effectively leverage the rich semantic information in TAGs datasets, their main drawback is that they are only partially interpretable, which limits their application in critical fields. In this paper, we propose a verbalized graph representation learning (VGRL) method which is fully interpretable. In contrast to traditional graph machine learning models, which are usually optimized within a continuous parameter space, VGRL constrains this parameter space to be text description which ensures complete interpretability throughout the entire process, making it easier for users to understand and trust the decisions of the model. We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VGRL and we believe these method can serve as a stepping stone in graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review. corresponding author: Zeyu Zhang</p></details> |

[2018]), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. [2019]). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Graph Neural Network (BPB-GNN), an architecture that resembles residual networks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-GNN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-GNN in the narrow width limit is generally superior or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general.</p></details> |  |

LLM inference requests vary in batch size, prompt length, and token generation number, while cloud providers employ different GPU types and quantities to meet diverse service-level objectives for accuracy and latency. It is crucial for both users and cloud providers to have a tool that quickly and accurately estimates the carbon impact of LLM inferences based on a combination of inference request and hardware configurations before execution. Estimating the carbon footprint of LLM inferences is more complex than training due to lower and highly variable model FLOPS utilization, rendering previous equation-based models inaccurate. Additionally, existing machine learning (ML) prediction methods either lack accuracy or demand extensive training data, as they inadequately handle the distinct prefill and decode phases, overlook hardware-specific features, and inefficiently sample uncommon inference configurations. We introduce \coo, a graph neural network (GNN)-based model that greatly improves the accuracy of LLM inference carbon footprint predictions compared to previous methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |

However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al. (2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight nowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts (predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron interaction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers, modeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and other limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50% in vision and language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>added...</summary><p>added Llama3-based results and other updates, code is https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/nino</p></details> |

Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation, reflection, and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how E(n)-equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different scales: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, as they match or surpass SotA equivariant TDL models with a significantly smaller computational burden, thus highlighting the benefits of a principled geometric inductive bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 11 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique. However, they are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs, but most existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DYGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and temporal variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DYGPROMPT through extensive experiments on four public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we introduce the Local Euler Characteristic Transform ($\ell$-ECT), a novel extension of the ECT particularly designed to enhance expressivity and interpretability in graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which may lose critical local details through aggregation, the $\ell$-ECT provides a lossless representation of local neighborhoods. This approach addresses key limitations in GNNs by preserving nuanced local structures while maintaining global interpretability. Moreover, we construct a rotation-invariant metric based on $\ell$-ECTs for spatial alignment of data spaces. Our method exhibits superior performance than standard GNNs on a variety of node classification tasks, particularly in graphs with high heterophily.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Message Passing Hierarchies for Mesh-Based Physics Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03779v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for large-scale mesh-based physics simulation. Existing approaches primarily employ hierarchical, multi-scale message passing to capture long-range dependencies within the graph. However, these graph hierarchies are typically fixed and manually designed, which do not adapt to the evolving dynamics present in complex physical systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural network named DHMP, which learns Dynamic Hierarchies for Message Passing networks through a differentiable node selection method. The key component is the anisotropic message passing mechanism, which operates at both intra-level and inter-level interactions. Unlike existing methods, it first supports directionally non-uniform aggregation of dynamic features between adjacent nodes within each graph hierarchy. Second, it determines node selection probabilities for the next hierarchy according to different physical contexts, thereby creating more flexible message shortcuts for learning remote node relations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DHMP, achieving 22.7% improvement on average compared to recent fixed-hierarchy message passing networks across five classic physics simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Sparsification via Mixture of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14260v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance across various graph learning tasks but face significant computational challenges when applied to large-scale graphs. One effective approach to mitigate these challenges is graph sparsification, which involves removing non-essential edges to reduce computational overhead. However, previous graph sparsification methods often rely on a single global sparsity setting and uniform pruning criteria, failing to provide customized sparsification schemes for each node's complex local context. In this paper, we introduce Mixture-of-Graphs (MoG), leveraging the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), to dynamically select tailored pruning solutions for each node. Specifically, MoG incorporates multiple sparsifier experts, each characterized by unique sparsity levels and pruning criteria, and selects the appropriate experts for each node. Subsequently, MoG performs a mixture of the sparse graphs produced by different experts on the Grassmann manifold to derive an optimal sparse graph. One notable property of MoG is its entirely local nature, as it depends on the specific circumstances of each individual node. Extensive experiments on four large-scale OGB datasets and two superpixel datasets, equipped with five GNN backbones, demonstrate that MoG (I) identifies subgraphs at higher sparsity levels ($8.67\%\sim 50.85\%$), with performance equal to or better than the dense graph, (II) achieves $1.47-2.62\times$ speedup in GNN inference with negligible performance drop, and (III) boosts ``top-student'' GNN performance ($1.02\%\uparrow$ on RevGNN+\textsc{ogbn-proteins} and $1.74\%\uparrow$ on DeeperGCN+\textsc{ogbg-ppa}).</p></details> |  |

While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p></details> |  |

These patterns are used to produce a rich set of transaction features for downstream machine learning training and inference tasks such as detection of fraudulent financial transactions. We show that our enriched transaction features dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of gradient-boosting-based machine learning models. Our library exploits multicore parallelism, maintains a dynamic in-memory graph, and efficiently mines subgraph patterns in the incoming transaction stream, which enables it to be operated in a streaming manner. Our solution, which combines our Graph Feature Preprocessor and gradient-boosting-based machine learning models, can detect illicit transactions with higher minority-class F1 scores than standard graph neural networks in anti-money laundering and phishing datasets. In addition, the end-to-end throughput rate of our solution executed on a multicore CPU outperforms the graph neural network baselines executed on a powerful V100 GPU. Overall, the combination of high accuracy, a high throughput rate, and low latency of our solution demonstrates the practical value of our library in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM I...</summary><p>ACM ICAIF'24, extended version</p></details> |

Following this trend, we propose a novel approach that empowers off-the-shelf LMs to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art GNNs on node classification tasks, without requiring any architectural modification. By preserving the LM's original architecture, our approach retains a key benefit of LM instruction tuning: the ability to jointly train on diverse datasets, fostering greater flexibility and efficiency. To achieve this, we introduce two key augmentation strategies: (1) Enriching LMs' input using topological and semantic retrieval methods, which provide richer contextual information, and (2) guiding the LMs' classification process through a lightweight GNN classifier that effectively prunes class candidates. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that backbone Flan-T5 models equipped with these augmentation strategies outperform state-of-the-art text-output node classifiers and are comparable to top-performing vector-output node classifiers. By bridging the gap between specialized task-specific node classifiers and general LMs, this work paves the way for more versatile and widely applicable graph learning models. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art models often struggle to consider the data in the best way possible, as well as intrinsic uncertainties and the actual physics of the traffic. In this study, we propose a novel framework to incorporate travel times between stations into a weighted adjacency matrix of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture with information from traffic stations based on their data availability. To handle uncertainty, we utilized the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) method that adjusts prediction intervals based on real-time validation residuals. To validate our results, we model a microscopic traffic scenario and perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to get a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT), and this distribution is compared against the real-world data. Experiments show that the proposed model outperformed the next-best model by approximately 24% in MAE and 8% in RMSE and validation showed the simulated travel time closely matches the 95th percentile of the observed travel time value.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted at the IEEE International Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC) 2024 which will be held September 24- 27, 2024 in Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

This scheme involves iteratively calculating a node's representation vector by aggregating and transforming the representation vectors of its adjacent nodes. Despite their effectiveness, MPGNNs face significant issues, such as oversquashing, oversmoothing, and underreaching, which hamper their effectiveness. Additionally, the reliance of MPGNNs on the homophily assumption, where edges typically connect nodes with similar labels and features, limits their performance in heterophilic contexts, where connected nodes often have significant differences. This necessitates the development of models that can operate effectively in both homophilic and heterophilic settings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ClassContrast, grounded in Energy Landscape Theory from Chemical Physics, to overcome these limitations. ClassContrast combines spatial and contextual information, leveraging a physics-inspired energy landscape to model node embeddings that are both discriminative and robust across homophilic and heterophilic settings. Our approach introduces contrast-based homophily matrices to enhance the understanding of class interactions and tendencies. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ClassContrast outperforms traditional GNNs in node classification and link prediction tasks, proving its effectiveness and versatility in diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

This paper reviews various propagation models, from traditional deterministic frameworks to advanced data-driven and deep learning approaches. We differentiate between static and dynamic networks, noting that static models provide foundational insights, while dynamic models capture real-world temporal changes. Deterministic models like the SIR framework offer clear mathematical insights but often lack adaptability to randomness, whereas stochastic models enhance realism at the cost of interpretability. Behavior-based models focus on individual decision-making, demanding more computational resources. Data-driven approaches improve accuracy in nonlinear scenarios by adapting to evolving networks, using either traditional models or model-free machine learning techniques. We explore supervised and unsupervised learning methods, as well as reinforcement learning, which operates without predefined datasets. The application of graph neural networks (GNNs) is also discussed, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling propagation in complex networks.

However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index.

Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for many problems and can be used when the mainstream preconditioners perform poorly. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable and can be much shorter than that of other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES.

Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01910v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo & al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</p></details> |  |

In the widely adopted message-passing GNN framework, nodes refine their representations by aggregating information from neighboring nodes iteratively. While GNNs excel in various domains, recent theoretical studies have raised concerns about their capabilities. GNNs aim to address various graph-related tasks by utilizing such node representations, however, this one-size-fits-all approach proves suboptimal for diverse tasks. Motivated by these observations, we conduct empirical tests to compare the performance of current GNN models with more conventional and direct methods in link prediction tasks. Introducing our model, PROXI, which leverages proximity information of node pairs in both graph and attribute spaces, we find that standard machine learning (ML) models perform competitively, even outperforming cutting-edge GNN models when applied to these proximity metrics derived from node neighborhoods and attributes. This holds true across both homophilic and heterophilic networks, as well as small and large benchmark datasets, including those from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Moreover, we show that augmenting traditional GNNs with PROXI significantly boosts their link prediction performance. Our empirical findings corroborate the previously mentioned theoretical observations and imply that there exists ample room for enhancement in current GNN models to reach their potential.</p></details> |  |

As the name implies, the focus is on enabling scalable operations that satisfy physical consistency via halo nodes at sub-graph boundaries. Here, consistency refers to the fact that a GNN trained and evaluated on one rank (one large graph) is arithmetically equivalent to evaluations on multiple ranks (a partitioned graph). This concept is demonstrated by interfacing GNNs with NekRS, a GPU-capable exascale CFD solver developed at Argonne National Laboratory. It is shown how the NekRS mesh partitioning can be linked to the distributed GNN training and inference routines, resulting in a scalable mesh-based data-driven modeling workflow. We study the impact of consistency on the scalability of mesh-based GNNs, demonstrating efficient scaling in consistent GNNs for up to O(1B) graph nodes on the Frontier exascale supercomputer.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, a wide number of DLWP architectures -- based on various backbones, including U-Net, Transformer, Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) -- have demonstrated their potential at forecasting atmospheric states. However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. In terms of accuracy, memory consumption, and runtime, our results illustrate various tradeoffs. For example, on synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO; and on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 365 days, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO. In addition, we observe that all of these model backbones "saturate," i.e., none of them exhibit so-called neural scaling, which highlights an important direction for future work on these and related models.

| **[Dynamic Graph Representation Learning via Edge Temporal States Modeling and Structure-reinforced Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10079v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph representation learning has emerged as a crucial research area, driven by the growing need for analyzing time-evolving graph data in real-world applications. While recent approaches leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, they often fail to adequately capture the impact of temporal edge states on inter-node relationships, consequently overlooking the dynamic changes in node features induced by these evolving relationships. Furthermore, these methods suffer from GNNs' inherent over-smoothing problem, which hinders the extraction of global structural features. To address these challenges, we introduce the Recurrent Structure-reinforced Graph Transformer (RSGT), a novel framework for dynamic graph representation learning. It first designs a heuristic method to explicitly model edge temporal states by employing different edge types and weights based on the differences between consecutive snapshots, thereby integrating varying edge temporal states into the graph's topological structure. We then propose a structure-reinforced graph transformer that captures temporal node representations encoding both graph topology and evolving dynamics through a recurrent learning paradigm, enabling the extraction of both local and global structural features. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate RSGT's superior performance in discrete dynamic graph representation learning, consistently outperforming existing methods in dynamic link prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Elsevier for possible publication.

| **[Dynamic Portfolio Rebalancing: A Hybrid new Model Using GNNs and Pathfinding for Cost Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01864v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to optimizing portfolio rebalancing by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting transaction costs and Dijkstra's algorithm for identifying cost-efficient rebalancing paths. Using historical stock data from prominent technology firms, the GNN is trained to forecast future transaction costs, which are then applied as edge weights in a financial asset graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the least costly path for reallocating capital between assets. Empirical results show that this hybrid approach significantly reduces transaction costs, offering a powerful tool for portfolio managers, especially in high-frequency trading environments. This methodology demonstrates the potential of combining advanced machine learning techniques with classical optimization algorithms to improve financial decision-making processes. Future research will explore expanding the asset universe and incorporating reinforcement learning for continuous portfolio optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Dynamic Graph Neural Networks with Provably High-Order Expressive Power](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01367v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DyGNNs) have garnered increasing research attention for learning representations on evolving graphs. Despite their effectiveness, the limited expressive power of existing DyGNNs hinders them from capturing important evolving patterns of dynamic graphs. Although some works attempt to enhance expressive capability with heuristic features, there remains a lack of DyGNN frameworks with provable and quantifiable high-order expressive power. To address this research gap, we firstly propose the k-dimensional Dynamic WL tests (k-DWL) as the referencing algorithms to quantify the expressive power of DyGNNs. We demonstrate that the expressive power of existing DyGNNs is upper bounded by the 1-DWL test. To enhance the expressive power, we propose Dynamic Graph Neural Network with High-order expressive power (HopeDGN), which updates the representation of central node pair by aggregating the interaction history with neighboring node pairs. Our theoretical results demonstrate that HopeDGN can achieve expressive power equivalent to the 2-DWL test. We then present a Transformer-based implementation for the local variant of HopeDGN. Experimental results show that HopeDGN achieved performance improvements of up to 3.12%, demonstrating the effectiveness of HopeDGN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Expressiveness of GNNs: A Computational Model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01308v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are extensively employed in graph machine learning, with considerable research focusing on their expressiveness. Current studies often assess GNN expressiveness by comparing them to the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests or classical graph algorithms. However, we identify three key issues in existing analyses: (1) some studies use preprocessing to enhance expressiveness but overlook its computational costs; (2) some claim the anonymous WL test's limited power while enhancing expressiveness using non-anonymous features, creating a mismatch; and (3) some characterize message-passing GNNs (MPGNNs) with the CONGEST model but make unrealistic assumptions about computational resources, allowing $\textsf{NP-Complete}$ problems to be solved in $O(m)$ depth. We contend that a well-defined computational model is urgently needed to serve as the foundation for discussions on GNN expressiveness. To address these issues, we introduce the Resource-Limited CONGEST (RL-CONGEST) model, incorporating optional preprocessing and postprocessing to form a framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness. Our framework sheds light on computational aspects, including the computational hardness of hash functions in the WL test and the role of virtual nodes in reducing network capacity. Additionally, we suggest that high-order GNNs correspond to first-order model-checking problems, offering new insights into their expressiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **["No Matter What You Do!": Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01272v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have exposed that GNNs are vulnerable to several adversarial attacks, among which backdoor attack is one of the toughest. Similar to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), backdoor attacks in GNNs lie in the fact that the attacker modifies a portion of graph data by embedding triggers and enforces the model to learn the trigger feature during the model training process. Despite the massive prior backdoor defense works on DNNs, defending against backdoor attacks in GNNs is largely unexplored, severely hindering the widespread application of GNNs in real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we present GCleaner, the first backdoor mitigation method on GNNs. GCleaner can mitigate the presence of the backdoor logic within backdoored GNNs by reversing the backdoor learning procedure, aiming to restore the model performance to a level similar to that is directly trained on the original clean dataset. To achieve this objective, we ask: How to recover universal and hard backdoor triggers in GNNs? How to unlearn the backdoor trigger feature while maintaining the model performance? We conduct the graph trigger recovery via the explanation method to identify optimal trigger locations, facilitating the search of universal and hard backdoor triggers in the feature space of the backdoored model through maximal similarity. Subsequently, we introduce the backdoor unlearning mechanism, which combines knowledge distillation and gradient-based explainable knowledge for fine-grained backdoor erasure. Extensive experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCleaner can reduce the backdoor attack success rate to 10% with only 1% of clean data, and has almost negligible degradation in model performance, which far outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

While Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have advanced, they face challenges like graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles. The authors propose using data augmentation (DA) techniques to address these issues, although many existing methods are not suitable for signed graphs due to a lack of side information. They highlight that the random DropEdge method, a rare DA approach applicable to signed graphs, does not enhance link sign prediction performance. In response, they introduce the Signed Graph Augmentation (SGA) framework, which includes a structure augmentation module to identify candidate edges and a strategy for selecting beneficial candidates, ultimately improving SGNN training. Experimental results show that SGA significantly boosts the performance of SGNN models, with a notable 32.3% improvement in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

As the complexity and adoption of blockchain networks continue to grow, traditional analytical methods are proving inadequate in capturing the intricate relationships and dynamic behaviors of decentralized systems. To address these limitations, deep learning models such as GNNs, GCNs, and CNNs offer robust solutions by leveraging the unique graph-based and temporal structures inherent in blockchain architectures. GNNs and GCNs, in particular, excel in modeling the relational data of blockchain nodes and transactions, making them ideal for applications such as fraud detection, transaction verification, and smart contract analysis. Meanwhile, CNNs can be adapted to analyze blockchain data when represented as structured matrices, revealing hidden temporal and spatial patterns in transaction flows. This paper explores how these models enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of both linear blockchains and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based systems, providing a comprehensive overview of their strengths and future research directions. By integrating advanced neural network techniques, we aim to demonstrate the potential of these models in revolutionizing blockchain analytics, paving the way for more sophisticated decentralized applications and improved network performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[WiGNet: Windowed Vision Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00807v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong adaptability to various real-world challenges, with architectures such as Vision GNN (ViG) achieving state-of-the-art performance in several computer vision tasks. However, their practical applicability is hindered by the computational complexity of constructing the graph, which scales quadratically with the image size. In this paper, we introduce a novel Windowed vision Graph neural Network (WiGNet) model for efficient image processing. WiGNet explores a different strategy from previous works by partitioning the image into windows and constructing a graph within each window. Therefore, our model uses graph convolutions instead of the typical 2D convolution or self-attention mechanism. WiGNet effectively manages computational and memory complexity for large image sizes. We evaluate our method in the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset and test the adaptability of WiGNet using the CelebA-HQ dataset as a downstream task with higher-resolution images. In both of these scenarios, our method achieves competitive results compared to previous vision GNNs while keeping memory and computational complexity at bay. WiGNet offers a promising solution toward the deployment of vision GNNs in real-world applications. We publicly released the code at https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/WiGNet.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to represent this data due to their prominent performance in capturing pairwise relationships. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of multi-modal medical data still pose significant challenges for standard GNNs, which struggle with learning higher-order, non-pairwise relationships. This paper proposes GAMMA-PD (Graph-based Analysis of Multi-modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease), a novel heterogeneous hypergraph fusion framework for multi-modal clinical data analysis. GAMMA-PD integrates imaging and non-imaging data into a "hypernetwork" (patient population graph) by preserving higher-order information and similarity between patient profiles and symptom subtypes. We also design a feature-based attention-weighted mechanism to interpret feature-level contributions towards downstream decision tasks. We evaluate our approach with clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a private dataset. We demonstrate gains in predicting motor impairment symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Our end-to-end framework also learns associations between subsets of patient characteristics to generate clinically relevant explanations for disease and symptom profiles.

| **[Stabilizing the Kumaraswamy Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00660v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale latent variable models require expressive continuous distributions that support efficient sampling and low-variance differentiation, achievable through the reparameterization trick. The Kumaraswamy (KS) distribution is both expressive and supports the reparameterization trick with a simple closed-form inverse CDF. Yet, its adoption remains limited. We identify and resolve numerical instabilities in the inverse CDF and log-pdf, exposing issues in libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow. We then introduce simple and scalable latent variable models based on the KS, improving exploration-exploitation trade-offs in contextual multi-armed bandits and enhancing uncertainty quantification for link prediction with graph neural networks. Our results support the stabilized KS distribution as a core component in scalable variational models for bounded latent variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Camera Data Association via GNN for Supervised Graph Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00643v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-camera data association is one of the cornerstones of the multi-camera computer vision field. Although often integrated into detection and tracking tasks through architecture design and loss definition, it is also recognized as an independent challenge. The ultimate goal is to connect appearances of one item from all cameras, wherever it is visible. Therefore, one possible perspective on this task involves supervised clustering of the affinity graph, where nodes are instances captured by all cameras. They are represented by appropriate visual features and positional attributes. We leverage the advantages of GNN (Graph Neural Network) architecture to examine nodes' relations and generate representative edge embeddings. These embeddings are then classified to determine the existence or non-existence of connections in node pairs. Therefore, the core of this approach is graph connectivity prediction. Experimental validation was conducted on multicamera pedestrian datasets across diverse environments such as the laboratory, basketball court, and terrace. Our proposed method, named SGC-CCA, outperformed the state-of-the-art method named GNN-CCA across all clustering metrics, offering an end-to-end clustering solution without the need for graph post-processing.
