The majority of the world's freshwater resources have inadequate monitoring of critical environmental variables needed for management. Yet, the need to have widespread predictions of hydrological variables such as river flow and water quality has become increasingly urgent due to climate and land use change over the past decades, and their associated impacts on water resources. Modern machine learning methods increasingly outperform their process-based and empirical model counterparts for hydrologic time series prediction with their ability to extract information from large, diverse data sets. We review relevant state-of-the art applications of machine learning for streamflow, water quality, and other water resources prediction and discuss opportunities to improve the use of machine learning with emerging methods for incorporating watershed characteristics into deep learning models, transfer learning, and incorporating process knowledge into machine learning models. The analysis here suggests most prior efforts have been focused on deep learning learning frameworks built on many sites for predictions at daily time scales in the United States, but that comparisons between different classes of machine learning methods are few and inadequate. We identify several open questions for time series predictions in unmonitored sites that include incorporating dynamic inputs and site characteristics, mechanistic understanding and spatial context, and explainable AI techniques in modern machine learning frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Accepted to Environmental Data Science</p></details> |
| **[Likelihood Based Inference for ARMA Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01198v4)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are frequently used to analyze time series data. Despite the popularity of these models, likelihood-based inference for ARMA models has subtleties that have been previously identified but continue to cause difficulties in widely used data analysis strategies. We discuss common pitfalls that may lead to sub-optimal maximum likelihood parameter estimates. We propose a random initialization algorithm for parameter estimation that frequently yields higher likelihoods than traditional maximum likelihood estimation procedures. We then investigate the parameter uncertainty of maximum likelihood estimates, and propose the use of profile confidence intervals as a superior alternative to intervals derived from the Fisher information matrix. Through a data analysis example and a series of simulation studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and the improved nominal coverage of profile confidence intervals compared to the normal approximation based on Fisher information.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The developmental version of the R package used in this paper is available at the following GitHub repository: git@github.com:jeswheel/arima2.git</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limit Theorems for Weakly Dependent Non-stationary Random Field Arrays and Asymptotic Inference of Dynamic Spatio-temporal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07429v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We obtain the law of large numbers (LLN) and the central limit theorem (CLT) for weakly dependent non-stationary arrays of random fields with asymptotically unbounded moments. The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling of Measurement Error in Financial Returns Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07405v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we consider the modeling of measurement error for fund returns data. In particular, given access to a time-series of discretely observed log-returns and the associated maximum over the observation period, we develop a stochastic model which models the true log-returns and maximum via a L\'evy process and the data as a measurement error there-of. The main technical difficulty of trying to infer this model, for instance Bayesian parameter estimation, is that the joint transition density of the return and maximum is seldom known, nor can it be simulated exactly. Based upon the novel stick breaking representation of [12] we provide an approximation of the model. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample from the Bayesian posterior of the approximated posterior and then extend this to a multilevel MCMC method which can reduce the computational cost to approximate posterior expectations, relative to ordinary MCMC. We implement our methodology on several applications including for real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field. The code for our framework is accessible at https://github.com/IkeYang/ViTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01138v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for Time Series Classification and Robust Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07314v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Despite their theoretical appeal, KAN require validation on large-scale benchmark datasets. Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for validating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and mixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance comparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series datasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output is primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and the hybrid structure MLP\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages, attributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN layers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial robustness of other models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figs |
| **[LiPCoT: Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for Self-supervised Learning of Time Series Data via Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07292v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets. Our work will inform future foundational models for time series, particularly for self-supervised learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Universality of periodic points in bounded discrete time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00290v6)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider arbitrary bounded discrete time series originating from dynamical system. Without any use of the Fourier transform, we find periodic points which suitably characterizes (i.e. independent of Lyapunov exponent) the corresponding time series. In particular, bounded discrete time series generated by the autoregressive model (without the white noise) is equivalent to a quasi periodic function.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores a comprehensive approach to demand forecasting at the origin-destination (O\&D) level, focusing on the development and implementation of machine learning models in decision-making for the air cargo industry. We leverage a mixture of experts framework, combining statistical and advanced deep learning models to provide reliable forecasts for cargo demand over a six-month horizon. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights for cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo industry. While this work is applied in the airline industry, the methodology is broadly applicable to any field where forecast-based decision-making in a volatile environment is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 10th Mining and Learning from Time Series Workshop: From Classical Methods to LLMs. SIGKDD, Barcelona, Spain, 6 page</p></details> |

Most existing performance assessments of LLMs for spatial tasks have primarily focused on ChatGPT, whereas other chatbots received less attention. To narrow this research gap, this study conducts a zero-shot correctness evaluation for a set of 76 spatial tasks across seven task categories assigned to four prominent chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot. The chatbots generally performed well on tasks related to spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code writing, and spatial reasoning. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in correctness of results between the four chatbots. Responses from repeated tasks assigned to each chatbot showed a high level of consistency in responses with matching rates of over 80% for most task categories in the four chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions in GIS</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Pre-Trained Transformers for Heart Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20775v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of AF, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG within the MIMIC Perform AF dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for AF screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Estimating Breakpoints between Climate States in Paleoclimate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08336v3)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a statistical time-domain approach for identifying transitions between climate states, referred to as breakpoints, using well-established econometric tools. We analyse a 67.1 million year record of the oxygen isotope ratio delta-18-O derived from benthic foraminifera. The dataset is presented in Westerhold et al. (2020), where the authors use recurrence analysis to identify six climate states. Fixing the number of breakpoints to five, our procedure results in breakpoint estimates that closely align with those identified by Westerhold et al. (2020). By treating the number of breakpoints as a parameter to be estimated, we provide the statistical justification for more than five breakpoints in the time series. Further, our approach offers the advantage of constructing confidence intervals for the breakpoints, and it allows for testing how many breakpoints are present in the time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors in alphabetical order</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Priors via Diffusion Bridge for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06672v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis test techniques. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series generation, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or correlated time series data streams. Since time series have unique characteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian prior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we exploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging diffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data distributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series diffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a constraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional time series generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learning from Leading Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548v6)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

| **[Unveiling the Flaws: A Critical Analysis of Initialization Effect on Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06620v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has gained significant attention over the past decade. Despite the reported improvements in several papers, the practical application of these models remains limited. Recent studies have cast doubt on these models, attributing their results to flawed evaluation techniques. However, the impact of initialization has largely been overlooked. This paper provides a critical analysis of the initialization effects on TSAD model performance. Our extensive experiments reveal that TSAD models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as window size, seed number, and normalization. This sensitivity often leads to significant variability in performance, which can be exploited to artificially inflate the reported efficacy of these models. We demonstrate that even minor changes in initialization parameters can result in performance variations that overshadow the claimed improvements from novel model architectures. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous evaluation protocols and transparent reporting of preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability and fairness of anomaly detection methods. This paper calls for a more cautious interpretation of TSAD advancements and encourages the development of more robust and transparent evaluation practices to advance the field and its practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel Sum of Squares for Data Adapted Kernel Learning of Dynamical Systems from Data: A global optimization approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06465v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the application of the Kernel Sum of Squares (KSOS) method for enhancing kernel learning from data, particularly in the context of dynamical systems. Traditional kernel-based methods, despite their theoretical soundness and numerical efficiency, frequently struggle with selecting optimal base kernels and parameter tuning, especially with gradient-based methods prone to local optima. KSOS mitigates these issues by leveraging a global optimization framework with kernel-based surrogate functions, thereby achieving more reliable and precise learning of dynamical systems. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on the Logistic Map, Henon Map, and Lorentz System, KSOS is shown to consistently outperform gradient descent in minimizing the relative-$\rho$ metric and improving kernel accuracy. These results highlight KSOS's effectiveness in predicting the behavior of chaotic dynamical systems, demonstrating its capability to adapt kernels to underlying dynamics and enhance the robustness and predictive power of kernel-based approaches, making it a valuable asset for time series analysis in various scientific fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time is Not Enough: Time-Frequency based Explanation for Time-Series Black-Box Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03636v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the massive attention given to time-series explanations due to their extensive applications, a notable limitation in existing approaches is their primary reliance on the time-domain. This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to "plug-in" various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.

There are very few quantitative evaluation methodologies and even fewer examples of actionable explanation, where the explanation methods are shown to objectively improve specific computational tasks on time series data. In this paper we focus on analyzing InterpretTime, a recent evaluation methodology for attribution methods applied to MTSC. We showcase some significant weaknesses of the original methodology and propose ideas to improve both its accuracy and efficiency. Unlike related work, we go beyond evaluation and also showcase the actionability of the produced explainer ranking, by using the best attribution methods for the task of channel selection in MTSC. We find that perturbation-based methods such as SHAP and Feature Ablation work well across a set of datasets, classifiers and tasks and outperform gradient-based methods. We apply the best ranked explainers to channel selection for MTSC and show significant data size reduction and improved classifier accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[cDVGAN: One Flexible Model for Multi-class Gravitational Wave Signal and Glitch Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16356v5)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating realistic time-domain observations of gravitational waves (GWs) and GW detector glitches can help in advancing GW data analysis. Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in time series forecasting, high noise-to-signal ratio, non-normality, non-stationarity, and lack of data continue challenging practitioners. In response, we leverage a simple representation augmentation technique to overcome these challenges. Our augmented representation acts as a statistical-space prior encoded at each time step. In response, we name our method Statistical-space Augmented Representation (SSAR). The underlying high-dimensional data-generating process inspires our representation augmentation. We rigorously examine the empirical generalization performance on two data sets with two downstream temporal learning algorithms. Our approach significantly beats all five up-to-date baselines. Moreover, the highly modular nature of our approach can easily be applied to various settings. Lastly, fully-fledged theoretical perspectives are available throughout the writing for a clear and rigorous understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2024 STRL Workshop (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Time-series: An Extensive Evaluation and Analysis of State-of-the-art Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03637v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series has been extensively investigated in the literature. Notwithstanding the relevance of this topic in numerous application fields, a comprehensive and extensive evaluation of recent state-of-the-art techniques taking into account real-world constraints is still needed. Some efforts have been made to compare existing unsupervised time-series anomaly detection methods rigorously. However, only standard performance metrics, namely precision, recall, and F1-score are usually considered. Essential aspects for assessing their practical relevance are therefore neglected. This paper proposes an in-depth evaluation study of recent unsupervised anomaly detection techniques in time-series. Instead of relying solely on standard performance metrics, additional yet informative metrics and protocols are taken into account. In particular, (i) more elaborate performance metrics specifically tailored for time-series are used; (ii) the model size and the model stability are studied; (iii) an analysis of the tested approaches with respect to the anomaly type is provided; and (iv) a clear and unique protocol is followed for all experiments. Overall, this extensive analysis aims to assess the maturity of state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection, give insights regarding their applicability under real-world setups and provide to the community a more complete evaluation protocol.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[xLSTMTime : Long-term Time Series Forecasting With xLSTM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10240v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based models have gained prominence in multivariate long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), demonstrating significant advancements despite facing challenges such as high computational demands, difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics, and managing long-term dependencies. The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language models can be zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14755v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023.

| **[Bidirectional Generative Pre-training for Improving Time Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09558v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning time-series representations for discriminative tasks, such as classification and regression, has been a long-standing challenge in the healthcare domain. Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging recent techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 18 figures. v2: updated funding acknowledgements</p></details> |
| **[An End-to-End Model for Time Series Classification In the Presence of Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05849v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification with missing data is a prevalent issue in time series analysis, as temporal data often contain missing values in practical applications. The traditional two-stage approach, which handles imputation and classification separately, can result in sub-optimal performance as label information is not utilized in the imputation process. On the other hand, a one-stage approach can learn features under missing information, but feature representation is limited as imputed errors are propagated in the classification process. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network that unifies data imputation and representation learning within a single framework, allowing the imputation process to take advantage of label information. Differing from previous methods, our approach places less emphasis on the accuracy of imputation data and instead prioritizes classification performance. A specifically designed multi-scale feature learning module is implemented to extract useful information from the noise-imputation data. The proposed model is evaluated on 68 univariate time series datasets from the UCR archive, as well as a multivariate time series dataset with various missing data ratios and 4 real-world datasets with missing information. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for incomplete time series classification, particularly in scenarios with high levels of missing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Learning of Nonlinear Independent Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05788v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the causal relations between interested variables plays a pivotal role in representation learning as it provides deep insights into the dataset. Identifiability, as the central theme of this approach, normally hinges on leveraging data from multiple distributions (intervention, distribution shift, time series, etc.). Despite the exciting development in this field, a practical but often overlooked problem is: what if those distribution shifts happen sequentially? In contrast, any intelligence possesses the capacity to abstract and refine learned knowledge sequentially -- lifelong learning. In this paper, with a particular focus on the nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) framework, we move one step forward toward the question of enabling models to learn meaningful (identifiable) representations in a sequential manner, termed continual causal representation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that model identifiability progresses from a subspace level to a component-wise level as the number of distributions increases. Empirically, we show that our method achieves performance comparable to nonlinear ICA methods trained jointly on multiple offline distributions and, surprisingly, the incoming new distribution does not necessarily benefit the identification of all latent variables.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

| **[Predicting Chaotic System Behavior using Machine Learning Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05702v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional time series forecasting methods across various applications, including both single-variable and multi-variable predictions. This study aims to investigate the capability of i) Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) ii) Reservoir Computing (RC) iii) Long short-term Memory (LSTM) for predicting chaotic system behavior, and to compare their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. These methods are applied to predict time series obtained from four representative chaotic systems including Lorenz, R\"ossler, Chen, Qi systems. In conclusion, we found that NG-RC is more computationally efficient and offers greater potential for predicting chaotic system behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Strong denoising of financial time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05690v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we introduce a method for significantly improving the signal to noise ratio in financial data. The approach relies on combining a target variable with different context variables and use auto-encoders (AEs) to learn reconstructions of the combined inputs. The objective is to obtain agreement among pairs of AEs which are trained on related but different inputs and for which they are forced to find common ground. The training process is set up as a "conversation" where the models take turns at producing a prediction (speaking) and reconciling own predictions with the output of the other AE (listening), until an agreement is reached. This leads to a new way of constraining the complexity of the data representation generated by the AE. Unlike standard regularization whose strength needs to be decided by the designer, the proposed mutual regularization uses the partner network to detect and amend the lack of generality of the learned representation of the data. The integration of alternative perspectives enhances the de-noising capacity of a single AE and allows us to discover new regularities in financial time-series which can be converted into profitable trading strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Representation Learning from Multiple Distributions: A General Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05052v3)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical functions of the latent causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects). For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the latent causal variables $Z_i$ and their causal relations represented by graph $\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series), without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases, most latent variables can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations. Experimental results verify our theoretical claims.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Dynamical causality under invisible confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05584v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causality inference is prone to spurious causal interactions, due to the substantial confounders in a complex system. While many existing methods based on the statistical methods or dynamical methods attempt to address misidentification challenges, there remains a notable lack of effective methods to infer causality, in particular in the presence of invisible/unobservable confounders. As a result, accurately inferring causation with invisible confounders remains a largely unexplored and outstanding issue in data science and AI fields. In this work, we propose a method to overcome such challenges to infer dynamical causality under invisible confounders (CIC method) and further reconstruct the invisible confounders from time-series data by developing an orthogonal decomposition theorem in a delay embedding space. The core of our CIC method lies in its ability to decompose the observed variables not in their original space but in their delay embedding space into the common and private subspaces respectively, thereby quantifying causality between those variables both theoretically and computationally. This theoretical foundation ensures the causal detection for any high-dimensional system even with only two observed variables under many invisible confounders, which is actually a long-standing problem in the field. In addition to the invisible confounder problem, such a decomposition actually makes the intertwined variables separable in the embedding space, thus also solving the non-separability problem of causal inference. Extensive validation of the CIC method is carried out using various real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrates its effectiveness to reconstruct real biological networks even with unobserved confounders.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Diffusion Model-based Contrastive Learning for Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05567v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based activity recognition has sparked numerous studies due to its widespread availability and privacy protection. However, when applied in practical applications, general CSI-based recognition models may face challenges related to the limited generalization capability, since individuals with different behavior habits will cause various fluctuations in CSI data and it is difficult to gather enough training data to cover all kinds of motion habits. To tackle this problem, we design a diffusion model-based Contrastive Learning framework for human Activity Recognition (CLAR) using WiFi CSI. On the basis of the contrastive learning framework, we primarily introduce two components for CLAR to enhance CSI-based activity recognition. To generate diverse augmented data and complement limited training data, we propose a diffusion model-based time series-specific augmentation model. In contrast to typical diffusion models that directly apply conditions to the generative process, potentially resulting in distorted CSI data, our tailored model dissects these condition into the high-frequency and low-frequency components, and then applies these conditions to the generative process with varying weights. This can alleviate data distortion and yield high-quality augmented data. To efficiently capture the difference of the sample importance, we present an adaptive weight algorithm. Different from typical contrastive learning methods which equally consider all the training samples, this algorithm adaptively adjusts the weights of positive sample pairs for learning better data representations. The experiments suggest that CLAR achieves significant gains compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[FTS: A Framework to Find a Faithful TimeSieve](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19647v2)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of time series forecasting has garnered significant attention in recent years, prompting the development of advanced models like TimeSieve, which demonstrates impressive performance. However, an analysis reveals certain unfaithfulness issues, including high sensitivity to random seeds, input and layer noise perturbations and parametric perturbations. Recognizing these challenges, we embark on a quest to define the concept of \textbf{\underline{F}aithful \underline{T}ime\underline{S}ieve \underline{(FTS)}}, a model that consistently delivers reliable and robust predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed at identifying and rectifying unfaithfulness in TimeSieve. Our framework is designed to enhance the model's stability and faithfulness, ensuring that its outputs are less susceptible to the aforementioned factors. Experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating improved faithfulness in the model's behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTMixer: Frequency and Time Domain Representations Fusion for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15256v2)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data can be represented in both the time and frequency domains, with the time domain emphasizing local dependencies and the frequency domain highlighting global dependencies. To harness the strengths of both domains in capturing local and global dependencies, we propose the Frequency and Time Domain Mixer (FTMixer). To exploit the global characteristics of the frequency domain, we introduce the Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module, designed to capture global inter-series dependencies. Inspired by the windowing concept in frequency domain transformations, we present the Windowing Frequency Convolution (WFC) module to capture local dependencies. The WFC module first applies frequency transformation within each window, followed by convolution across windows. Furthermore, to better capture these local dependencies, we employ channel-independent scheme to mix the time domain and frequency domain patches. Notably, FTMixer employs the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) with real numbers instead of the complex-number-based Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), enabling direct utilization of modern deep learning operators in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results across seven real-world long-term time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of FTMixer, in terms of both forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in exploring the impact of food intake on physiological indicators (e.g., weight) over time. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the DietDiary dataset, which encompasses daily dietary diaries and corresponding weight measurements of real users. Furthermore, we propose a novel task of weight prediction with a dietary diary that aims to leverage historical food intake and weight to predict future weights. To tackle this task, we propose a model-agnostic time series forecasting framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Meal Representation Learning (UMRL) module to extract representations for each meal. Additionally, we design a diet-aware loss function to associate food intake with weight variations. By conducting experiments on the DietDiary dataset with two state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, NLinear and iTransformer, we demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to the original models. We make our dataset, code, and models publicly available at: https://yxg1005.github.io/weight-prediction/.</p></details> | ACM MM'24 oral |
| **[Time Series Forecasting with LLMs: Understanding and Enhancing Model Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10835v3)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in many fields and have developed rapidly in recent years. As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Masquerade Attacks in Controller Area Networks Using Graph Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05427v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles rely on a myriad of electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected via controller area networks (CANs) for critical operations. Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using only graph-based features. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ROAD dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the detection rates of masquerade attacks compared to a baseline that uses only graph-based features, as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (p < 0.05).</p></details> |  |

In order to be both effective and practical, the design of a performance test must achieve a reasonable trade-off between result quality and testing time. This becomes particularly challenging in Java context, where the software undergoes a warm-up phase of execution, due to just-in-time compilation. During this phase, performance measurements are subject to severe fluctuations, which may adversely affect quality of performance test results. However, these approaches often provide suboptimal estimates of the warm-up phase, resulting in either insufficient or excessive warm-up iterations, which may degrade result quality or increase testing time. There is still a lack of consensus on how to properly address this problem. Here, we propose and study an AI-based framework to dynamically halt warm-up iterations at runtime. Specifically, our framework leverages recent advances in AI for Time Series Classification (TSC) to predict the end of the warm-up phase during test execution. We conduct experiments by training three different TSC models on half a million of measurement segments obtained from JMH microbenchmark executions. We find that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of the warm-up estimates provided by state-of-practice and state-of-the-art methods. This higher estimation accuracy results in a net improvement in either result quality or testing time for up to +35.3% of the microbenchmarks. Our study highlights that integrating AI to dynamically estimate the end of the warm-up phase can enhance the cost-effectiveness of Java performance testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in The 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '24)</p></details> |

We propose a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive experiments using several state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and accurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop https://openreview.net/forum?id=GZBGhi4JfE</p></details> |

These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal</p></details> |

Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data.

Our method involves dividing the forecasting horizon into segments, predicting the most crucial steps in each segment non-autoregressively, and the remaining steps autoregressively. The segmentation process relies on latent variables, which effectively capture the significance of individual time steps through variational inference. In comparison to AR models, ProNet showcases remarkable advantages, requiring fewer AR iterations, resulting in faster prediction speed, and mitigating error accumulation. On the other hand, when compared to NAR models, ProNet takes into account the interdependency of predictions in the output space, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing four large datasets, and an ablation study, demonstrate the effectiveness of ProNet, highlighting its superior performance in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, outperforming state-of-the-art AR and NAR forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evaluation of Standard Statistical Models and LLMs on Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04867v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting time series, with a specific focus on the LLMTIME model. Despite the established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction. We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components, as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.</p></details> |  |

Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can improve processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy. These findings help inform real-world best practices for building dynamic displays.

Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) are often used to this end as they are adept at handling data that are spatially distributed, including solutions to partial differential equations. When applied to unsteady physics problems, ROMs also require a model for time-series prediction of the low-dimensional latent variables. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network useful for modeling sequential data, are frequently employed in data-driven ROMs for autoregressive time-series prediction. When making predictions at unseen design points over long time horizons, error propagation is a frequently encountered issue, where errors made early on can compound over time and lead to large inaccuracies. In this work, we propose using bagging, a commonly used ensemble learning technique, to develop a fully data-driven ROM framework referred to as the CAE-eLSTM ROM that uses CAEs for spatial reconstruction of the full-order model and LSTM ensembles for time-series prediction. When applied to two unsteady fluid dynamics problems, our results show that the presented framework effectively reduces error propagation and leads to more accurate time-series prediction of latent variables at unseen points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with revisions</p></details> |

DeepVATS is a tool that merges Deep Learning (Deep) with Visual Analytics (VA) for the analysis of large time series data (TS). It has three interconnected modules. The Deep Learning module, developed in R, manages the load of datasets and Deep Learning models from and to the Storage module. This module also supports models training and the acquisition of the embeddings from the latent space of the trained model. The Storage module operates using the Weights and Biases system. Subsequently, these embeddings can be analyzed in the Visual Analytics module. This module, based on an R Shiny application, allows the adjustment of the parameters related to the projection and clustering of the embeddings space. Once these parameters are set, interactive plots representing both the embeddings, and the time series are shown. This paper introduces the tool and examines its scalability through log analytics. The execution time evolution is examined while the length of the time series is varied. This is achieved by resampling a large data series into smaller subsets and logging the main execution and rendering times for later analysis of scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Admit...</summary><p>Admitted pending publication in Lecture Notes in Network and Systems (LNNS) series (Springer).

Besides traditional statistical models, modern forecasting techniques based on machine learning can be employed when treating volatility as a univariate, daily time-series. Moreover, econometric studies have shown that increasing the number of daily observations with high-frequency intraday data helps to improve volatility predictions. In this work, we propose DeepVol, a model based on Dilated Causal Convolutions that uses high-frequency data to forecast day-ahead volatility. Our empirical findings demonstrate that dilated convolutional filters are highly effective at extracting relevant information from intraday financial time-series, proving that this architecture can effectively leverage predictive information present in high-frequency data that would otherwise be lost if realised measures were precomputed. Simultaneously, dilated convolutional filters trained with intraday high-frequency data help us avoid the limitations of models that use daily data, such as model misspecification or manually designed handcrafted features, whose devise involves optimising the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency and makes models prone to lack of adaptation into changing circumstances. In our analysis, we use two years of intraday data from NASDAQ-100 to evaluate the performance of DeepVol. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed deep learning-based approach effectively learns global features from high-frequency data, resulting in more accurate predictions compared to traditional methodologies and producing more accurate risk measures.</p></details> | Updated version |

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |

However, causal relationships are difficult to be fully observed in real-world complex settings, such as spatial-temporal data from deployed sensor networks. Therefore, to capture fine-grained causal relations among spatial-temporal variables for further a more accurate and reliable time series analysis, we first design a conceptual fine-grained causal model named TBN Granger Causality, which adds time-respecting Bayesian Networks to the previous time-lagged Neural Granger Causality to offset the instantaneous effects. Second, we propose an end-to-end deep generative model called TacSas, which discovers TBN Granger Causality in a generative manner to help forecast time series data and detect possible anomalies during the forecast. For evaluations, besides the causality discovery benchmark Lorenz-96, we also test TacSas on climate benchmark ERA5 for climate forecasting and the extreme weather benchmark of NOAA for extreme weather alerts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 AI for Science Workshop</p></details> |

For example, quantifying the risk of adverse outcomes after an acute cardiovascular event helps healthcare providers identify those patients at the highest risk of poor outcomes; i.e., patients who benefit from invasive therapies that can lower their risk. Assessing the risk of adverse outcomes, however, is challenging due to the complexity, variability, and heterogeneity of longitudinal medical data, especially for individuals suffering from chronic diseases like heart failure. In this paper, we introduce Event-Based Contrastive Learning (EBCL) - a method for learning embeddings of heterogeneous patient data that preserves temporal information before and after key index events. We demonstrate that EBCL can be used to construct models that yield improved performance on important downstream tasks relative to other pretraining methods. We develop and test the method using a cohort of heart failure patients obtained from a large hospital network and the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset consisting of patients in an intensive care unit at a large tertiary care center. On both cohorts, EBCL pretraining yields models that are performant with respect to a number of downstream tasks, including mortality, hospital readmission, and length of stay. In addition, unsupervised EBCL embeddings effectively cluster heart failure patients into subgroups with distinct outcomes, thereby providing information that helps identify new heart failure phenotypes. The contrastive framework around the index event can be adapted to a wide array of time-series datasets and provides information that can be used to guide personalized care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Unifying Representations in Neural Models Workshop in NeurIPS 2023, MLHC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Transformer for High Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04245v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic. The source code and dataset are publicly available https://github.com/xinzzzhou/ScalableTransformer4HighDimensionMTSF.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cluster-Wide Task Slowdown Detection in Cloud System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04236v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slow task detection is a critical problem in cloud operation and maintenance since it is highly related to user experience and can bring substantial liquidated damages. Most anomaly detection methods detect it from a single-task aspect. However, considering millions of concurrent tasks in large-scale cloud computing clusters, it becomes impractical and inefficient. Moreover, single-task slowdowns are very common and do not necessarily indicate a malfunction of a cluster due to its violent fluctuation nature in a virtual environment. Thus, we shift our attention to cluster-wide task slowdowns by utilizing the duration time distribution of tasks across a cluster, so that the computation complexity is not relevant to the number of tasks. The task duration time distribution often exhibits compound periodicity and local exceptional fluctuations over time. Though transformer-based methods are one of the most powerful methods to capture these time series normal variation patterns, we empirically find and theoretically explain the flaw of the standard attention mechanism in reconstructing subperiods with low amplitude when dealing with compound periodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose SORN (i.e., Skimming Off subperiods in descending amplitude order and Reconstructing Non-slowing fluctuation), which consists of a Skimming Attention mechanism to reconstruct the compound periodicity and a Neural Optimal Transport module to distinguish cluster-wide slowdowns from other exceptional fluctuations. Furthermore, since anomalies in the training set are inevitable in a practical scenario, we propose a picky loss function, which adaptively assigns higher weights to reliable time slots in the training set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SORN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-world industrial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by KDD2024</p></details> |
| **[Improved Adaboost Algorithm for Web Advertisement Click Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05245v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores an improved Adaboost algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), which aims to improve the prediction accuracy of user clicks on web page advertisements. By comparing it with several common machine learning algorithms, the paper analyses the advantages of the new model in ad click prediction. It is shown that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper performs well in user ad click prediction with an accuracy of 92%, which is an improvement of 13.6% compared to the highest of 78.4% among the other three base models. This significant improvement indicates that the algorithm is more capable of capturing user behavioural characteristics and time series patterns. In addition, this paper evaluates the model's performance on other performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the improved Adaboost algorithm based on LSTM is significantly ahead of the traditional model in all these metrics, which further validates its effectiveness and superiority. Especially when facing complex and dynamically changing user behaviours, the model is able to better adapt and make accurate predictions. In order to ensure the practicality and reliability of the model, this study also focuses on the accuracy difference between the training set and the test set. After validation, the accuracy of the proposed model on these two datasets only differs by 1.7%, which is a small difference indicating that the model has good generalisation ability and can be effectively applied to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Crime Prediction With Spatial Temporal Multivariate Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04193v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crime forecasting is a critical component of urban analysis and essential for stabilizing society today. Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARLA: Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09296v4)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is the lack of labelled data in many real-life scenarios. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods focus on learning the normal behaviour of unlabelled time series in an unsupervised manner. The normal boundary is often defined tightly, resulting in slight deviations being classified as anomalies, consequently leading to a high false positive rate and a limited ability to generalise normal patterns. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end self-supervised ContrAstive Representation Learning approach for time series Anomaly detection (CARLA). While existing contrastive learning methods assume that augmented time series windows are positive samples and temporally distant windows are negative samples, we argue that these assumptions are limited as augmentation of time series can transform them to negative samples, and a temporally distant window can represent a positive sample. Our contrastive approach leverages existing generic knowledge about time series anomalies and injects various types of anomalies as negative samples. Therefore, CARLA not only learns normal behaviour but also learns deviations indicating anomalies. It creates similar representations for temporally closed windows and distinct ones for anomalies. Additionally, it leverages the information about representations' neighbours through a self-supervised approach to classify windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours to further enhance the performance of anomaly detection. In extensive tests on seven major real-world time series anomaly detection datasets, CARLA shows superior performance over state-of-the-art self-supervised and unsupervised TSAD methods. Our research shows the potential of contrastive representation learning to advance time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Open-Set Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12294v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous methods for time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) have emerged in recent years, most of which are unsupervised and assume that only normal samples are available during the training phase, due to the challenge of obtaining abnormal data in real-world scenarios. Still, limited samples of abnormal data are often available, albeit they are far from representative of all possible anomalies. Supervised methods can be utilized to classify normal and seen anomalies, but they tend to overfit to the seen anomalies present during training, hence, they fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. We propose the first algorithm to address the open-set TSAD problem, called Multivariate Open-Set Time-Series Anomaly Detector (MOSAD), that leverages only a few shots of labeled anomalies during the training phase in order to achieve superior anomaly detection performance compared to both supervised and unsupervised TSAD algorithms. MOSAD is a novel multi-head TSAD framework with a shared representation space and specialized heads, including the Generative head, the Discriminative head, and the Anomaly-Aware Contrastive head. The latter produces a superior representation space for anomaly detection compared to conventional supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets establish MOSAD as a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECAI-2024</p></details> |

Recently, Transformer neural network architectures have shown promising results in forecasting on common time series benchmark datasets. However, application to supply chain demand forecasting, which can have challenging characteristics such as sparsity and cross-series effects, has been limited. In this work, we explore the application of Transformer-based models to supply chain demand forecasting. In particular, we develop a new Transformer-based forecasting approach using a shared, multi-task per-time series network with an initial component applying attention across time series, to capture interactions and help address sparsity. We provide a case study applying our approach to successfully improve demand prediction for a medical device manufacturing company. To further validate our approach, we also apply it to public demand forecasting datasets as well and demonstrate competitive to superior performance compared to a variety of baseline and state-of-the-art forecast methods across the private and public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Prediction of Causes (not Effects) in Healthcare by Long-Term Clinical Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03816v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early syndrome diagnosis aims to solve the intricate task of predicting a ground truth label that most often is the outcome (effect) of a medical consensus definition applied to observed clinical measurements (causes), given clinical measurements observed several hours before. Instead of focusing on the prediction of the future effect, we propose to directly predict the causes via time series forecasting (TSF) of clinical variables and determine the effect by applying the gold standard consensus definition to the forecasted values. This method has the invaluable advantage of being straightforwardly interpretable to clinical practitioners, and because model training does not rely on a particular label anymore, the forecasted data can be used to predict any consensus-based label. We exemplify our method by means of long-term TSF with Transformer models, with a focus on accurate prediction of sparse clinical variables involved in the SOFA-based Sepsis-3 definition and the new Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) definition. Our experiments are conducted on two datasets and show that contrary to recent proposals which advocate set function encoders for time series and direct multi-step decoders, best results are achieved by a combination of standard dense encoders with iterative multi-step decoders. The key for success of iterative multi-step decoding can be attributed to its ability to capture cross-variate dependencies and to a student forcing training strategy that teaches the model to rely on its own previous time step predictions for the next time step prediction.</p></details> |  |

Block maxima (BM), an approach in EVT that seeks estimates of parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV), can be generalized to take into account not just the maximum realization from a given dataset, but the r largest order statistics for a given r. In this work we propose a parameter estimation method that combines the r largest order statistic (r-LOS) extension of BM with permutation bootstrapping: surrogate realizations are obtained by randomly reordering the original data set, and then r-LOS is applied to these shuffled measurements - the mean estimate computed from these surrogate realizations is the desired estimate. We used synthetic observations and real meteorological time series to verify the performance of our method; we found that the combination of r-LOS and bootstrapping resulted in estimates more accurate than when either approach was implemented separately.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Theory of Evolutionary Spectra for Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Robust Inference in Possibly Misspecified and Nonstationary Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02981v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a theory of evolutionary spectra for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust (HAR) inference when the data may not satisfy second-order stationarity. Nonstationarity is a common feature of economic time series which may arise either from parameter variation or model misspecification. In such a context, the theories that support HAR inference are either not applicable or do not provide accurate approximations. HAR tests standardized by existing long-run variance estimators then may display size distortions and little or no power. This issue can be more severe for methods that use long bandwidths (i.e., fixed-b HAR tests). We introduce a class of nonstationary processes that have a time-varying spectral representation which evolves continuously except at a finite number of time points. We present an extension of the classical heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators that applies two smoothing procedures. One is over the lagged autocovariances, akin to classical HAC estimators, and the other is over time. The latter element is important to flexibly account for nonstationarity. We name them double kernel HAC (DK-HAC) estimators. We show the consistency of the estimators and obtain an optimal DK-HAC estimator under the mean squared error (MSE) criterion. Overall, HAR tests standardized by the proposed DK-HAC estimators are competitive with fixed-b HAR tests, when the latter work well, with regards to size control even when there is strong dependence. Notably, in those empirically relevant situations in which previous HAR tests are undersized and have little or no power, the DK-HAC estimator leads to tests that have good size and power.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2103.00060</p></details> |

We focus on series with a bounded spectral density that change smoothly under the null hypothesis but exhibits change-points or becomes less smooth under the alternative. We address two local problems. The first is the detection of discontinuities (or breaks) in the spectrum at unknown dates and frequencies. The second involves abrupt yet continuous changes in the spectrum over a short time period at an unknown frequency without signifying a break. Both problems can be cast into changes in the degree of smoothness of the spectral density over time. We consider estimation and minimax-optimal testing. We determine the optimal rate for the minimax distinguishable boundary, i.e., the minimum break magnitude such that we are able to uniformly control type I and type II errors. We propose a novel procedure for the estimation of the change-points based on a wild sequential top-down algorithm and show its consistency under shrinking shifts and possibly growing number of change-points. Our method can be used across many fields and a companion program is made available in popular software packages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Granger Causality using Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03703v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependence between nodes in a network is an important concept that pervades many areas including finance, politics, sociology, genomics and the brain sciences. One way to characterize dependence between components of a multivariate time series data is via Granger Causality (GC). Standard traditional approaches to GC estimation / inference commonly assume linear dynamics, however such simplification does not hold in many real-world applications where signals are inherently non-linear. In such cases, imposing linear models such as vector autoregressive (VAR) models can lead to mis-characterization of true Granger Causal interactions. To overcome this limitation, Tank et al (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Learning, 2022) proposed a solution that uses neural networks with sparse regularization penalties. The regularization encourages learnable weights to be sparse, which enables inference on GC. This paper overcomes the limitations of current methods by leveraging advances in machine learning and deep learning which have been demonstrated to learn hidden patterns in the data. We propose novel classes of models that can handle underlying non-linearity in a computationally efficient manner, simultaneously providing GC and lag order selection. Firstly, we present the Learned Kernel VAR (LeKVAR) model that learns kernel parameterized by a shared neural net followed by penalization on learnable weights to discover GC structure. Secondly, we show one can directly decouple lags and individual time series importance via decoupled penalties. This is important as we want to select the lag order during the process of GC estimation. This decoupling acts as a filtering and can be extended to any DL model including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Transformers etc, for simultaneous GC estimation and lag selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be Submitted to a Journal work Presented at JSM. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1802.05842 by other authors</p></details> |

Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Typical choices for activation functions are ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid etc., where the choice generally depends on the application domain. In this work, we propose a framework/strategy that unifies several works on activation functions and theoretically explains the performance benefits of these works. We also propose novel techniques that originate from the framework and allow us to obtain ``extensions'' (i.e. special generalizations of a given neural network) of neural networks through operations on activation functions. We theoretically and empirically show that ``extensions'' of neural networks have performance benefits compared to vanilla neural networks with insignificant space and time complexity costs on standard test functions. We also show the benefits of neural network ``extensions'' in the time-series domain on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Approximation For Non-stationary Time Series with Optimal Rate and Explicit Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02913v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical inference for time series such as curve estimation for time-varying models or testing for existence of change-point have garnered significant attention. However, these works are generally restricted to the assumption of independence and/or stationarity at its best. The main obstacle is that the existing Gaussian approximation results for non-stationary processes only provide an existential proof and thus they are difficult to apply. In this paper, we provide two clear paths to construct such a Gaussian approximation for non-stationary series. While the first one is theoretically more natural, the second one is practically implementable. Our Gaussian approximation results are applicable for a very large class of non-stationary time series, obtain optimal rates and yet have good applicability. Building on such approximations, we also show theoretical results for change-point detection and simultaneous inference in presence of non-stationary errors. Finally we substantiate our theoretical results with simulation studies and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Serve As Time Series Anomaly Detectors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03475v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging topic in large language models (LLMs) is their application to time series forecasting, characterizing mainstream and patternable characteristics of time series. A relevant but rarely explored and more challenging question is whether LLMs can detect and explain time series anomalies, a critical task across various real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA3, in detecting and explaining anomalies in time series. Our studies reveal that: 1) LLMs cannot be directly used for time series anomaly detection. 2) By designing prompt strategies such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting, GPT-4 can detect time series anomalies with results competitive to baseline methods. 3) We propose a synthesized dataset to automatically generate time series anomalies with corresponding explanations. By applying instruction fine-tuning on this dataset, LLaMA3 demonstrates improved performance in time series anomaly detection tasks. In summary, our exploration shows the promising potential of LLMs as time series anomaly detectors.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting. The source code for SpecSTG is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpecSTG.</p></details> |  |

Adapting the similarity-based framework of Lin and Eck (2020), we exploit series that have experienced similar shocks. We aggregate their shock-induced excess volatilities by positing the shocks to be affine functions of exogenous covariates. The volatility shocks are modeled as random effects and estimated as fixed effects. The aggregation of these estimates is done in service of adjusting the $h$-step-ahead GARCH forecast of the time series under study by an additive term. The adjusted and unadjusted forecasts are evaluated using the unobservable but easily-estimated realized volatility (RV). A real-world application is provided, as are simulation results suggesting the conditions and hyperparameters under which our method thrives.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Hierarchical time series, where lower-level forecasts must sum to upper-level ones, are prevalent in various contexts, such as retail sales across countries. Current empirical evaluations of forecasting methods are often limited to a small set of benchmark datasets, offering a narrow view of algorithm behavior. RHiOTS addresses this gap by systematically altering existing datasets and modifying the characteristics of individual series and their interrelations. It uses a set of parameterizable transformations to simulate those changes in the data distribution. Additionally, RHiOTS incorporates an innovative visualization component, turning complex, multidimensional robustness evaluation results into intuitive, easily interpretable visuals. This approach allows an in-depth analysis of algorithm and model behavior under diverse conditions. We illustrate the use of RHiOTS by analyzing the predictive performance of several algorithms. Our findings show that traditional statistical methods are more robust than state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, except when the transformation effect is highly disruptive. Furthermore, we found no significant differences in the robustness of the algorithms when applying specific reconciliation methods, such as MinT. RHiOTS provides researchers with a comprehensive tool for understanding the nuanced behavior of forecasting algorithms, offering a more reliable basis for selecting the most appropriate method for a given problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '24), August 25--29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |

Polymodel theory can solve this issue and demonstrate superiority in portfolio construction from various aspects. To implement the PolyModel theory for constructing a hedge fund portfolio, we begin by identifying an asset pool, utilizing over 10,000 hedge funds for the past 29 years' data. PolyModel theory also involves choosing a wide-ranging set of risk factors, which includes various financial indices, currencies, and commodity prices. This comprehensive selection mirrors the complexities of the real-world environment. Leveraging on the PolyModel theory, we create quantitative measures such as Long-term Alpha, Long-term Ratio, and SVaR. We also use more classical measures like the Sharpe ratio or Morningstar's MRAR. To enhance the performance of the constructed portfolio, we also employ the latest deep learning techniques (iTransformer) to capture the upward trend, while efficiently controlling the downside, using all the features. The iTransformer model is specifically designed to address the challenges in high-dimensional time series forecasting and could largely improve our strategies. More precisely, our strategies achieve better Sharpe ratio and annualized return. The above process enables us to create multiple portfolio strategies aiming for high returns and low risks when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

It is a fundamental problem in modern applications and the objects considered may be as diverse as locations in space, text documents, images, twitter messages, or trajectories of moving objects. In this paper we are motivated by the latter application. Trajectories are recorded movements of mobile objects such as vehicles, animals, public transportation, or parts of the human body. We propose a novel distance function called DistanceAvg to capture the similarity of such movements. To be practical, it is necessary to provide indexing for this distance measure. Fortunately we do not need to start from scratch. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Our function DistanceAvg is a metric. Although metric indexes have been studied for decades and many such structures are available, they do not offer the best performance with trajectories. In this paper we propose a new design, which outperforms the best existing indexes for kNN queries and is equally good for range queries. It is especially suitable for expensive distance functions as they occur in trajectory similarity search. In many applications, kNN queries are more practical than range queries as it may be difficult to determine an appropriate search radius. Our index provides exact result sets for the given distance function.</p></details> | 54 pages, 26 figures |

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RALTPER: A Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner for Complex Environment with Gaussian Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05838v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner (RALTPER) for autonomous vehicles in complex environments characterized by Gaussian uncertainty. The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

| **[PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique.

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |

In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset.

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects.

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks.

| **[A Holistic Optimization Framework for Energy Efficient UAV-assisted Fog Computing: Attitude Control, Trajectory Planning and Task Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14894v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significantly enhanced fog computing by acting as both flexible computation platforms and communication mobile relays. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources.

Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Human Trajectory Prediction with Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18756v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of human trajectories is important for planning in autonomous systems that act in the real world, e.g. automated driving or mobile robots. Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

By harnessing recent progress in tracking, specifically point trajectories and self-supervised representation learning, we build trajectory-aligned tokens (TATs) that capture motion and appearance information. This approach significantly reduces the data requirements while retaining essential information. To process these representations, we use a Masked Space-time Transformer that effectively learns to aggregate information to facilitate few-shot action recognition.

| **[Trajectory Planning Using Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Overtaking Maneuvers in Autonomous Racing Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10658v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous racing are based on the sequential execution of prediction of the opposing vehicles and subsequent trajectory planning for the ego vehicle. If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

| **[TLControl: Trajectory and Language Control for Human Motion Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17135v4)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable human motion synthesis is essential for applications in AR/VR, gaming and embodied AI. Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

Results indicate the proposed filtering algorithm robustly extracts clean, long, and uninterrupted trajectories for further processing.

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research. To support continued research, all source code has been made available under an open-source license.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security & Trust (PST 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Guaranteed Trajectory Tracking under Learned Dynamics with Contraction Metrics and Disturbance Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08222v5)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to trajectory-centric learning control based on contraction metrics and disturbance estimation for nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties. The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |

We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers.

In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures.

The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms.

| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems.

Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits.

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training ST Trajectory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

| **[Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Enabled Emergency Wireless Communications Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11896v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[PRET: Planning with Directed Fidelity Trajectory for Vision and Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11487v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision and language navigation is a task that requires an agent to navigate according to a natural language instruction. Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

The system uses readily accessible information from customer smartphones and retail apps, including motion data, store maps, and purchase records. This eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers full data control. Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |

As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

In their unconstrained form, graph neural networks fall into this category, and they have further limited abilities to handle heterogeneous data. To overcome these limitations, an approach is proposed, called IGNH (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneous tabular data), which handles both categorical and numerical features, while constraining the learning process to generate exact feature attributions together with the predictions. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that the feature attributions provided by IGNH align with Shapley values that are computed post hoc. Furthermore, the results show that IGNH outperforms two powerful machine learning algorithms for tabular data, Random Forests and TabNet, while reaching a similar level of performance as XGBoost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 27th International Conference on Discovery Science 2024</p></details> |

This public dataset facilitates an in-depth examination of brainwave patterns within musical contexts, providing a robust foundation for studying brain network topology during emotional processing. Leveraging the MEEG dataset, we introduce the Attention-based Temporal Learner with Dynamic Graph Neural Network (AT-DGNN), a novel framework for EEG-based emotion recognition. This model combines an attention mechanism with a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) to capture intricate EEG dynamics. The AT-DGNN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an accuracy of 83.74% in arousal recognition and 86.01% in valence recognition, outperforming existing SOTA methods. Comparative analysis with traditional datasets, such as DEAP, further validates the model's effectiveness and underscores the potency of music as an emotional stimulus. This study advances graph-based learning methodology in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), significantly improving the accuracy of EEG-based emotion recognition. The MEEG dataset and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/xmh1011/AT-DGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Heterogeneous Graph Learning on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07569v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning electronic health records (EHRs) has received emerging attention because of its capability to facilitate accurate medical diagnosis. Since the EHRs contain enriched information specifying complex interactions between entities, modeling EHRs with graphs is shown to be effective in practice. The EHRs, however, present a great degree of heterogeneity, sparsity, and complexity, which hamper the performance of most of the models applied to them. Moreover, existing approaches modeling EHRs often focus on learning the representations for a single task, overlooking the multi-task nature of EHR analysis problems and resulting in limited generalizability across different tasks. In view of these limitations, we propose a novel framework for EHR modeling, namely MulT-EHR (Multi-Task EHR), which leverages a heterogeneous graph to mine the complex relations and model the heterogeneity in the EHRs. To mitigate the large degree of noise, we introduce a denoising module based on the causal inference framework to adjust for severe confounding effects and reduce noise in the EHR data. Additionally, since our model adopts a single graph neural network for simultaneous multi-task prediction, we design a multi-task learning module to leverage the inter-task knowledge to regularize the training process. Extensive empirical studies on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets validate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in four popular EHR analysis tasks -- drug recommendation, and predictions of the length of stay, mortality, and readmission. Thorough ablation studies demonstrate the robustness of our method upon variations to key components and hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |
| **[ADEdgeDrop: Adversarial Edge Dropping for Robust Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09171v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exhibited the powerful ability to gather graph-structured information from neighborhood nodes via various message-passing mechanisms, the performance of GNNs is limited by poor generalization and fragile robustness caused by noisy and redundant graph data. As a prominent solution, Graph Augmentation Learning (GAL) has recently received increasing attention. Among prior GAL approaches, edge-dropping methods that randomly remove edges from a graph during training are effective techniques to improve the robustness of GNNs. However, randomly dropping edges often results in bypassing critical edges, consequently weakening the effectiveness of message passing. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial edge-dropping method (ADEdgeDrop) that leverages an adversarial edge predictor guiding the removal of edges, which can be flexibly incorporated into diverse GNN backbones. Employing an adversarial training framework, the edge predictor utilizes the line graph transformed from the original graph to estimate the edges to be dropped, which improves the interpretability of the edge-dropping method. The proposed ADEdgeDrop is optimized alternately by stochastic gradient descent and projected gradient descent. Comprehensive experiments on six graph benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ADEdgeDrop outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various GNN backbones, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of Transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, graph Transformers embed a graph structure into the Transformer architecture to overcome the limitations of local neighborhood aggregation while avoiding strict structural inductive biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of GNNs and graph Transformers in computer vision from a task-oriented perspective. Specifically, we divide their applications in computer vision into five categories according to the modality of input data, \emph{i.e.,} 2D natural images, videos, 3D data, vision + language, and medical images. In each category, we further divide the applications according to a set of vision tasks. Such a task-oriented taxonomy allows us to examine how each task is tackled by different GNN-based approaches and how well these approaches perform. Based on the necessary preliminaries, we provide the definitions and challenges of the tasks, in-depth coverage of the representative approaches, as well as discussions regarding insights, limitations, and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (T-PAMI)</p></details> |

Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Few-shot Self-explaining Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07340v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have spurred an upsurge of research dedicated to enhancing the explainability of GNNs, particularly in critical domains such as medicine. A promising approach is the self-explaining method, which outputs explanations along with predictions. However, existing self-explaining models require a large amount of training data, rendering them unavailable in few-shot scenarios. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Meta-learned Self-Explaining GNN (MSE-GNN), a novel framework that generates explanations to support predictions in few-shot settings. MSE-GNN adopts a two-stage self-explaining structure, consisting of an explainer and a predictor. Specifically, the explainer first imitates the attention mechanism of humans to select the explanation subgraph, whereby attention is naturally paid to regions containing important characteristics. Subsequently, the predictor mimics the decision-making process, which makes predictions based on the generated explanation. Moreover, with a novel meta-training process and a designed mechanism that exploits task information, MSE-GNN can achieve remarkable performance on new few-shot tasks. Extensive experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that MSE-GNN can achieve superior performance on prediction tasks while generating high-quality explanations compared with existing methods.

| **[RSEA-MVGNN: Multi-View Graph Neural Network with Reliable Structural Enhancement and Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07331v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exhibited remarkable efficacy in learning from multi-view graph data. In the framework of multi-view graph neural networks, a critical challenge lies in effectively combining diverse views, where each view has distinct graph structure features (GSFs). Existing approaches to this challenge primarily focus on two aspects: 1) prioritizing the most important GSFs, 2) utilizing GNNs for feature aggregation. However, prioritizing the most important GSFs can lead to limited feature diversity, and existing GNN-based aggregation strategies equally treat each view without considering view quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-View Graph Neural Network with Reliable Structural Enhancement and Aggregation (RSEA-MVGNN). Firstly, we estimate view-specific uncertainty employing subjective logic. Based on this uncertainty, we design reliable structural enhancement by feature de-correlation algorithm. This approach enables each enhancement to focus on different GSFs, thereby achieving diverse feature representation in the enhanced structure. Secondly, the model learns view-specific beliefs and uncertainty as opinions, which are utilized to evaluate view quality. Based on these opinions, the model enables high-quality views to dominate GNN aggregation, thereby facilitating representation learning. Experimental results conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that RSEA-MVGNN outperforms several state-of-the-art GNN-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Inference Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06909v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the high dimensionality and complexity of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data pose significant challenges in pan-cancer studies. This study hypothesizes that gene sets derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data will outperform those selected using bulk RNA-seq in pan-cancer downstream tasks. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 181 tumor biopsies across 13 cancer types. High-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) was performed to identify relevant gene sets, which were further refined using XGBoost for feature selection. These gene sets were applied to downstream tasks using TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data and compared to six reference gene sets and oncogenes from OncoKB evaluated with deep learning models, including multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). The XGBoost-refined hdWGCNA gene set demonstrated higher performance in most tasks, including tumor mutation burden assessment, microsatellite instability classification, mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and grading. In particular, genes such as DPM1, BAD, and FKBP4 emerged as important pan-cancer biomarkers, with DPM1 consistently significant across tasks. This study presents a robust approach for feature selection in cancer genomics by integrating scRNA-seq data and advanced analysis techniques, offering a promising avenue for improving predictive accuracy in cancer research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 1 tables, and 6 supplementary Table</p></details> |

Both contain noisy information about the labels. Here we propose joint denoising and rewiring (JDR)--an algorithm to jointly denoise the graph structure and features, which can improve the performance of any downstream algorithm. We do this by defining and maximizing the alignment between the leading eigenspaces of graph and feature matrices. To approximately solve this computationally hard problem, we propose a heuristic that efficiently handles real-world graph datasets with many classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic data and real-world graph datasets. The results show that JDR consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on node classification tasks using GNNs as downstream models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The logic of rational graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13139v8)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be described via appropriate fragments of the first order logic. Any query of the two variable fragment of graded modal logic (GC2) interpreted over labeled graphs can be expressed using a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNN whose size does not grow with graph input sizes [Barcelo & Al., 2020]. Conversely, a GNN expresses at most a query of GC2, for any choice of activation function. In this article, we prove that some GC2 queries of depth $3$ cannot be expressed by GNNs with any rational activation function. This shows that not all non-polynomial activation functions confer GNNs maximal expressivity, answering a open question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. This result is also in contrast with the efficient universal approximation properties of rational feedforward neural networks investigated by [Boull\'e & Al., 2020]. We also present a rational subfragment of the first order logic (RGC2), and prove that rational GNNs can express RGC2 queries uniformly over all graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSHPool: The Separated Subgraph-based Hierarchical Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16133v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a novel local graph pooling method, namely the Separated Subgraph-based Hierarchical Pooling (SSHPool), for graph classification. We commence by assigning the nodes of a sample graph into different clusters, resulting in a family of separated subgraphs. We individually employ the local graph convolution units as the local structure to further compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. Since these subgraphs are separated by different clusters and the structural information cannot be propagated between them, the local convolution operation can significantly avoid the over-smoothing problem caused by message passing through edges in most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By hierarchically performing the proposed procedures on the resulting coarsened graph, the proposed SSHPool can effectively extract the hierarchical global features of the original graph structure, encapsulating rich intrinsic structural characteristics. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end GNN framework associated with the SSHPool module for graph classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

This challenge involves efficiently allocating jobs to a limited number of machines while minimizing factors like total processing time or job delays. While recent advancements in artificial intelligence have yielded promising solutions, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, this paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for JSSP. We introduce the very first supervised 120k dataset specifically designed to train LLMs for JSSP. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that LLM-based scheduling can achieve performance comparable to other neural approaches. Furthermore, we propose a sampling method that enhances the effectiveness of LLMs in tackling JSSP.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUGNN: Harmonizing Fairness and Utility in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17034v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often face a challenging trade-off, where prioritizing fairness may require compromising utility. In this work, we re-examine fairness through the lens of spectral graph theory, aiming to reconcile fairness and utility within the framework of spectral graph learning. We explore the correlation between sensitive features and spectrum in GNNs, using theoretical analysis to delineate the similarity between original sensitive features and those after convolution under different spectra. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the impact of similarity when the eigenvectors associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalue exhibit directional similarity. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose FUGNN, a novel spectral graph learning approach that harmonizes the conflict between fairness and utility. FUGNN ensures algorithmic fairness and utility by truncating the spectrum and optimizing eigenvector distribution during the encoding process. The fairness-aware eigenvector selection reduces the impact of convolution on sensitive features while concurrently minimizing the sacrifice of utility. FUGNN further optimizes the distribution of eigenvectors through a transformer architecture. By incorporating the optimized spectrum into the graph convolution network, FUGNN effectively learns node representations.

Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time, the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Convergence of Message Passing Graph Neural Networks with Generic Aggregation On Large Random Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11140v3)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the convergence of message passing graph neural networks on random graph models to their continuous counterpart as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Until now, this convergence was only known for architectures with aggregation functions in the form of normalized means, or, equivalently, of an application of classical operators like the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian. We extend such results to a large class of aggregation functions, that encompasses all classically used message passing graph neural networks, such as attention-based message passing, max convolutional message passing, (degree-normalized) convolutional message passing, or moment-based aggregation message passing. Under mild assumptions, we give non-asymptotic bounds with high probability to quantify this convergence. Our main result is based on the McDiarmid inequality. Interestingly, this result does not apply to the case where the aggregation is a coordinate-wise maximum. We treat this case separately and obtain a different convergence rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Approach to Predict the Effects of Road Capacity Reduction Policies: A Case Study for Paris, France](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06762v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper introduces an innovative approach to assess the effects of traffic policies using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). By incorporating complex transport network structures directly into the neural network, this approach could enable rapid testing of various policies without the delays associated with traditional simulations. We provide a proof of concept that GNNs can learn and predict changes in car volume resulting from capacity reduction policies. We train a GNN model based on a training set generated with a MATSim simulation for Paris, France. We analyze the model's performance across different road types and scenarios, finding that the GNN is generally able to learn the effects on edge-based traffic volume induced by policies. The model is especially successful in predicting changes on major streets. Nevertheless, the evaluation also showed that the current model has problems in predicting impacts of spatially small policies and changes in traffic volume in regions where no policy is applied due to spillovers and/or relocation of traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computation-friendly Graph Neural Network Design by Accumulating Knowledge on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06717v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), like other neural networks, have shown remarkable success but are hampered by the complexity of their architecture designs, which heavily depend on specific data and tasks. Traditionally, designing proper architectures involves trial and error, which requires intensive manual effort to optimize various components. To reduce human workload, researchers try to develop automated algorithms to design GNNs. However, both experts and automated algorithms suffer from two major issues in designing GNNs: 1) the substantial computational resources expended in repeatedly trying candidate GNN architectures until a feasible design is achieved, and 2) the intricate and prolonged processes required for humans or algorithms to accumulate knowledge of the interrelationship between graphs, GNNs, and performance. To further enhance the automation of GNN architecture design, we propose a computation-friendly way to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized knowledge in designing GNNs, thereby drastically shortening the computational overhead and development cycle of designing GNN architectures. Our framework begins by establishing a knowledge retrieval pipeline that comprehends the intercorrelations between graphs, GNNs, and performance. This pipeline converts past model design experiences into structured knowledge for LLM reference, allowing it to quickly suggest initial model proposals. Subsequently, we introduce a knowledge-driven search strategy that emulates the exploration-exploitation process of human experts, enabling quick refinement of initial proposals within a promising scope. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can efficiently deliver promising (e.g., Top-5.77%) initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and without any prior training and achieve outstanding search performance in a few iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[RW-NSGCN: A Robust Approach to Structural Attacks via Negative Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06665v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely applied in various practical scenarios, such as predicting user interests and detecting communities in social networks. However, recent studies have shown that graph-structured networks often contain potential noise and attacks, in the form of topological perturbations and weight disturbances, which can lead to decreased classification performance in GNNs. To improve the robustness of the model, we propose a novel method: Random Walk Negative Sampling Graph Convolutional Network (RW-NSGCN). Specifically, RW-NSGCN integrates the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) and PageRank (PGR) algorithms for negative sampling and employs a Determinantal Point Process (DPP)-based GCN for convolution operations. RWR leverages both global and local information to manage noise and local variations, while PGR assesses node importance to stabilize the topological structure. The DPP-based GCN ensures diversity among negative samples and aggregates their features to produce robust node embeddings, thereby improving classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the RW-NSGCN model effectively addresses network topology attacks and weight instability, increasing the accuracy of anomaly detection and overall stability. In terms of classification accuracy, RW-NSGCN significantly outperforms existing methods, showing greater resilience across various scenarios and effectively mitigating the impact of such vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Laplacian-based Quantum Graph Neural Network for Semi-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05498v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Laplacian learning method is a well-established technique in classical graph-based semi-supervised learning, but its potential in the quantum domain remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the performance of the Laplacian-based Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (QSSL) method across four benchmark datasets -- Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease. Further analysis explores the impact of increasing Qubit counts, revealing that adding more Qubits to a quantum system doesn't always improve performance. The effectiveness of additional Qubits depends on the quantum algorithm and how well it matches the dataset. Additionally, we examine the effects of varying entangling layers on entanglement entropy and test accuracy. The performance of Laplacian learning is highly dependent on the number of entangling layers, with optimal configurations varying across different datasets. Typically, moderate levels of entanglement offer the best balance between model complexity and generalization capabilities. These observations highlight the crucial need for precise hyperparameter tuning tailored to each dataset to achieve optimal performance in Laplacian learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraNNDis: Efficient Unified Distributed Training Framework for Deep GNNs on Large Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06837v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one of the rapidly growing fields within deep learning. While many distributed GNN training frameworks have been proposed to increase the training throughput, they face three limitations when applied to multi-server clusters. 1) They suffer from an inter-server communication bottleneck because they do not consider the inter-/intra-server bandwidth gap, a representative characteristic of multi-server clusters. 2) Redundant memory usage and computation hinder the scalability of the distributed frameworks. 3) Sampling methods, de facto standard in mini-batch training, incur unnecessary errors in multi-server clusters. We found that these limitations can be addressed by exploiting the characteristics of multi-server clusters. Here, we propose GraNNDis, a fast distributed GNN training framework for multi-server clusters. Firstly, we present Flexible Preloading, which preloads the essential vertex dependencies server-wise to reduce the low-bandwidth inter-server communications. Secondly, we introduce Cooperative Batching, which enables memory-efficient, less redundant mini-batch training by utilizing high-bandwidth intra-server communications. Thirdly, we propose Expansion-aware Sampling, a cluster-aware sampling method, which samples the edges that affect the system speedup. As sampling the intra-server dependencies does not contribute much to the speedup as they are communicated through fast intra-server links, it only targets a server boundary to be sampled. Lastly, we introduce One-Hop Graph Masking, a computation and communication structure to realize the above methods in multi-server environments. We evaluated GraNNDis on multi-server clusters, and it provided significant speedup over the state-of-the-art distributed GNN training frameworks. GraNNDis is open-sourced at https://github.com/AIS-SNU/GraNNDis_Artifact to facilitate its use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Node Representations for Real-World Complex Networks with Topological Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13033v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph augmentation methods play a crucial role in improving the performance and enhancing generalisation capabilities in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing graph augmentation methods mainly perturb the graph structures, and are usually limited to pairwise node relations. These methods cannot fully address the complexities of real-world large-scale networks, which often involve higher-order node relations beyond only being pairwise. Meanwhile, real-world graph datasets are predominantly modelled as simple graphs, due to the scarcity of data that can be used to form higher-order edges. Therefore, reconfiguring the higher-order edges as an integration into graph augmentation strategies lights up a promising research path to address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present Topological Augmentation (TopoAug), a novel graph augmentation method that builds a combinatorial complex from the original graph by constructing virtual hyperedges directly from the raw data. TopoAug then produces auxiliary node features by extracting information from the combinatorial complex, which are used for enhancing GNN performances on downstream tasks. We design three diverse virtual hyperedge construction strategies to accompany the construction of combinatorial complexes: (1) via graph statistics, (2) from multiple data perspectives, and (3) utilising multi-modality. Furthermore, to facilitate TopoAug evaluation, we provide 23 novel real-world graph datasets across various domains including social media, biology, and e-commerce. Our empirical study shows that TopoAug consistently and significantly outperforms GNN baselines and other graph augmentation methods, across a variety of application contexts, which clearly indicates that it can effectively incorporate higher-order node relations into the graph augmentation for real-world complex networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In 27...</summary><p>In 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2024). 13 pages, 2 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

| **[Decentralized Cooperation in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Graph Neural Network-Based Intrinsic Motivation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06503v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is emerging as a key framework for various sequential decision-making and control tasks. Unlike their single-agent counterparts, multi-agent systems necessitate successful cooperation among the agents. The deployment of these systems in real-world scenarios often requires decentralized training, a diverse set of agents, and learning from infrequent environmental reward signals. These challenges become more pronounced under partial observability and the lack of prior knowledge about agent heterogeneity. While notable studies use intrinsic motivation (IM) to address reward sparsity or cooperation in decentralized settings, those dealing with heterogeneity typically assume centralized training, parameter sharing, and agent indexing. To overcome these limitations, we propose the CoHet algorithm, which utilizes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based intrinsic motivation to facilitate the learning of heterogeneous agent policies in decentralized settings, under the challenges of partial observability and reward sparsity. Evaluation of CoHet in the Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE) and Vectorized Multi-Agent Simulator (VMAS) benchmarks demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in a range of cooperative multi-agent scenarios. Our research is supplemented by an analysis of the impact of the agent dynamics model on the intrinsic motivation module, insights into the performance of different CoHet variants, and its robustness to an increasing number of heterogeneous agents.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

This is exacerbated by the Hour-of-Service (HOS) regulations, which often result in unauthorized parking practices, causing safety concerns. It has been shown that providing accurate parking usage prediction can be a cost-effective solution to reduce unsafe parking practices. In light of this, existing studies have developed various methods to predict the usage of a truck parking site and have demonstrated satisfactory accuracy. However, these studies focus on a single parking site, and few approaches have been proposed to predict the usage of multiple truck parking sites considering spatio-temporal dependencies, due to the lack of data. This paper aims to fill this gap and presents the Regional Temporal Graph Neural Network (RegT-GCN) to predict parking usage across the entire state to provide more comprehensive truck parking information. The framework leverages the topological structures of truck parking site locations and historical parking data to predict the occupancy rate considering spatio-temporal dependencies across a state. To achieve this, we introduce a Regional Decomposition approach, which effectively captures the geographical characteristics of the truck parking locations and their spatial correlations. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models, improving performance by more than 20%.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational and memory requirements for training GNNs on large-scale graphs make it necessary to distribute the training. A prerequisite for distributed GNN training is to partition the input graph into smaller parts that are distributed among multiple machines of a compute cluster. Although graph partitioning has been studied with regard to graph analytics and graph databases, its effect on GNN training performance is largely unexplored. As a consequence, it is unclear whether investing computational efforts into high-quality graph partitioning would pay off in GNN training scenarios. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of graph partitioning for distributed GNN training. Our study aims to understand how different factors such as GNN parameters, mini-batch size, graph type, features size, and scale-out factor influence the effectiveness of graph partitioning. We conduct experiments with two different GNN systems using vertex and edge partitioning. We found that high-quality graph partitioning is a very effective optimization to speed up GNN training and to reduce memory consumption. Furthermore, our results show that invested partitioning time can quickly be amortized by reduced GNN training time, making it a relevant optimization for most GNN scenarios. Compared to research on distributed graph processing, our study reveals that graph partitioning plays an even more significant role in distributed GNN training, which motivates further research on the graph partitioning problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT), 25th, March-28th March, 2025</p></details> |

We seek to better understand this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Since most of these models apply graph neural networks (GNNs), one may suspect that they inherit the representational limitations of GNNs. We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing expressivity at the expense of generalization. We also investigate this possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and affords up to 1000x speedup. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to reassess and redirect the existing paradigm and efforts for SBDD.</p></details> | 25 pages, 11 figures |

The quest for models that can seamlessly integrate and interpret multimodal data is more pressing than ever. Imagine a system that can understand language with the depth and nuance of human cognition, while simultaneously interpreting the rich visual context of the world around it. We present ARPA, an architecture that fuses the unparalleled contextual understanding of large language models with the advanced feature extraction capabilities of transformers, which then pass through a custom Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer to learn intricate relationships and subtle nuances within the data. This innovative architecture not only sets a new benchmark in visual word disambiguation but also introduces a versatile framework poised to transform how linguistic and visual data interact by harnessing the synergistic strengths of its components, ensuring robust performance even in the most complex disambiguation scenarios. Through a series of experiments and comparative analysis, we reveal the substantial advantages of our model, underscoring its potential to redefine standards in the field. Beyond its architectural prowess, our architecture excels through experimental enrichments, including sophisticated data augmentation and multi-modal training techniques. ARPA's introduction marks a significant milestone in visual word disambiguation, offering a compelling solution that bridges the gap between linguistic and visual modalities. We invite researchers and practitioners to explore the capabilities of our model, envisioning a future where such hybrid models drive unprecedented advancements in artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

| **[GraphTransfer: A Generic Feature Fusion Framework for Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05792v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in collaborative filtering tasks due to their ability to extract powerful structural features. However, combining the graph features extracted from user-item interactions and auxiliary features extracted from user genres and item properties remains a challenge. Currently available fusion methods face two major issues: 1) simple methods such as concatenation and summation are generic, but not accurate in capturing feature relationships; 2) task-specific methods like attention mechanisms and meta paths may not be suitable for general feature fusion. To address these challenges, we present GraphTransfer, a simple but universal feature fusion framework for GNN-based collaborative filtering. Our method accurately fuses different types of features by first extracting graph features from the user-item interaction graph and auxiliary features from users and items using GCN. The proposed cross fusion module then effectively bridges the semantic gaps between the interaction scores of different features. Theoretical analysis and experiments on public datasets show that GraphTransfer outperforms other feature fusion methods in CF tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our framework via empirical studies in three other scenarios, showing that GraphTransfer leads to significant improvements in the performance of CF algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Despite large-scale deployment, studies have highlighted critical security concerns in IoT networks, many of which stem from firmware-related issues. Furthermore, IoT swarms have become more prevalent in industries, smart homes, and agricultural applications, among others. Malicious activity on one node in a swarm can propagate to larger network sections. Although several Remote Attestation (RA) techniques have been proposed, they are limited by their latency, availability, complexity, hardware assumptions, and uncertain access to firmware copies under Intellectual Property (IP) rights. We present Swarm-Net, a novel swarm attestation technique that exploits the inherent, interconnected, graph-like structure of IoT networks along with the runtime information stored in the Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to detect malicious firmware and its downstream effects. We also present the first datasets on SRAM-based swarm attestation encompassing different types of firmware and edge relationships. In addition, a secure swarm attestation protocol is presented. Swarm-Net is not only computationally lightweight but also does not require a copy of the firmware. It achieves a 99.96% attestation rate on authentic firmware, 100% detection rate on anomalous firmware, and 99% detection rate on propagated anomalies, at a communication overhead and inference latency of ~1 second and ~10^{-5} seconds (on a laptop CPU), respectively. In addition to the collected datasets, Swarm-Net's effectiveness is evaluated on simulated trace replay, random trace perturbation, and dropped attestation responses, showing robustness against such threats. Lastly, we compare Swarm-Net with past works and present a security analysis.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needed toward specific downstream predictions or have shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of several well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which covers essential connections between different dense groups. An in-depth comparison of different path selection plans is offered to illustrate the strength of our designed L2SP. Then, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts. Next, we feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to learn embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against the state-of-the-art WalkLM method on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and link prediction) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search), meanwhile saving more than 90% of training paths.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

The viability of geometric learning for regression tasks was benchmarked against a collection of linear models through a combination of simulated and real-world data training studies. First, a selection of five arbitrarily designed multi-step surrogate functions were developed to reflect various features commonly found within experimental processes. A graph transformer network outperformed all tested linear models in scenarios that featured hidden interactions between process steps and sequence dependent features, while retaining equivalent performance in sequence agnostic scenarios. Then, a similar comparison was applied to real-world literature data on algorithm guided colloidal atomic layer deposition. Using the complete reaction sequence as training data, the graph neural network outperformed all linear models in predicting the three spectral properties for most training set sizes. Further implementation of graph neural networks and geometric representation of scientific processes for the prediction of experiment outcomes could lead to algorithm driven navigation of higher dimension parameter spaces and efficient exploration of more dynamic systems.</p></details> |  |

As data complexity and interconnectivity grow, it is common for graph-structured data to be split and stored in a distributed manner, underscoring the necessity of federated learning on subgraphs. In this work, we propose FedHGN, a novel algorithm for federated hypergraph learning. Our algorithm utilizes subgraphs of a hypergraph stored on distributed devices to train local HGNN models in a federated manner:by collaboratively developing an effective global HGNN model through sharing model parameters while preserving client privacy. Additionally, considering that hyperedges may span multiple clients, a pre-training step is employed before the training process in which cross-client hyperedge feature gathering is performed at the central server. In this way, the missing cross-client information can be supplemented from the central server during the node feature aggregation phase. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Node Level Graph Autoencoder: Unified Pretraining for Textual Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07091v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Textual graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, featuring rich text information with complex relationships, which enables advanced research across various fields. Textual graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional feature embeddings from textual graphs that can improve the performance of downstream tasks. A high-quality feature embedding should effectively capture both the structural and the textual information in a textual graph. However, most textual graph dataset benchmarks rely on word2vec techniques to generate feature embeddings, which inherently limits their capabilities. Recent works on textual graph representation learning can be categorized into two folds: supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods finetune a language model on labeled nodes, which have limited capabilities when labeled data is scarce. Unsupervised methods, on the other hand, extract feature embeddings by developing complex training pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified unsupervised learning autoencoder framework, named Node Level Graph AutoEncoder (NodeGAE). We employ language models as the backbone of the autoencoder, with pretraining on text reconstruction. Additionally, we add an auxiliary loss term to make the feature embeddings aware of the local graph structure. Our method maintains simplicity in the training process and demonstrates generalizability across diverse textual graphs and downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on two core graph representation learning downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of diverse graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple textual graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference with Semi-implicit Branch Length Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05058v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the evolutionary history relating a collection of molecular sequences is the main subject of modern Bayesian phylogenetic inference. However, the commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be inefficient due to the complicated space of phylogenetic trees, especially when the number of sequences is large. An alternative approach is variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI) which transforms the inference problem into an optimization problem. While effective, the default diagonal lognormal approximation for the branch lengths of the tree used in VBPI is often insufficient to capture the complexity of the exact posterior. In this work, we propose a more flexible family of branch length variational posteriors based on semi-implicit hierarchical distributions using graph neural networks. We show that this semi-implicit construction emits straightforward permutation equivariant distributions, and therefore can handle the non-Euclidean branch length space across different tree topologies with ease. To deal with the intractable marginal probability of semi-implicit variational distributions, we develop several alternative lower bounds for stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over baseline methods on benchmark data examples, in terms of both marginal likelihood estimation and branch length posterior approximation.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Networks as Ordering Heuristics for Parallel Graph Coloring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05054v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph coloring problem asks for an assignment of the minimum number of distinct colors to vertices in an undirected graph with the constraint that no pair of adjacent vertices share the same color. The problem is a thoroughly studied NP-hard combinatorial problem with several real-world applications. As such, a number of greedy heuristics have been suggested that strike a good balance between coloring quality, execution time, and also parallel scalability. In this work, we introduce a graph neural network (GNN) based ordering heuristic and demonstrate that it outperforms existing greedy ordering heuristics both on quality and performance. Previous results have demonstrated that GNNs can produce high-quality colorings but at the expense of excessive running time. The current paper is the first that brings the execution time down to compete with existing greedy heuristics. Our GNN model is trained using both supervised and unsupervised techniques. The experimental results show that a 2-layer GNN model can achieve execution times between the largest degree first (LF) and smallest degree last (SL) ordering heuristics while outperforming both on coloring quality. Increasing the number of layers improves the coloring quality further, and it is only at four layers that SL becomes faster than the GNN. Finally, our GNN-based coloring heuristic achieves superior scaling in the parallel setting compared to both SL and LF.</p></details> |  |
| **[A GNN Model with Adaptive Weights for Session-Based Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05051v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation systems aim to model users' interests based on their sequential interactions to predict the next item in an ongoing session. In this work, we present a novel approach that can be used in session-based recommendations (SBRs). Our goal is to enhance the prediction accuracy of an existing session-based recommendation model, the SR-GNN model, by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism applied to the graph neural network (GNN) vectors. This mechanism is designed to incorporate various types of side information obtained through different methods during the study. Items are assigned varying degrees of importance within each session as a result of the weighting mechanism. We hypothesize that this adaptive weighting strategy will contribute to more accurate predictions and thus improve the overall performance of SBRs in different scenarios. The adaptive weighting strategy can be utilized to address the cold start problem in SBRs by dynamically adjusting the importance of items in each session, thus providing better recommendations in cold start situations, such as for new users or newly added items. Our experimental evaluations on the Dressipi dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to traditional models in enhancing the user experience and highlighting its potential to optimize the recommendation results in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, and 3 equations</p></details> |

Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables; Project page: https://github.com/KimMeen/Awesome-GNN4TS</p></details> |
| **[Better Not to Propagate: Understanding Edge Uncertainty and Over-smoothing in Signed Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04895v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) rely on network homophily, which can lead to performance degradation due to over-smoothing in many real-world heterophily scenarios. Recent studies analyze the smoothing effect (separability) after message-passing (MP), depending on the expectation of node features. Regarding separability gain, they provided theoretical backgrounds on over-smoothing caused by various propagation schemes, including positive, signed, and blocked MPs. More recently, by extending these theorems, some works have suggested improvements in signed propagation under multiple classes. However, prior works assume that the error ratio of all propagation schemes is fixed, failing to investigate this phenomenon correctly. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method for estimating homophily and edge error ratio, integrated with dynamic selection between blocked and signed propagation during training. Our theoretical analysis, supported by extensive experiments, demonstrates that blocking MP can be more effective than signed propagation under high edge error ratios, improving the performance in both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDS-GNN: A Mutual Dual-Stream Graph Neural Network on Graphs with Incomplete Features and Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04845v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing and learning representations from graph-structured data. A crucial prerequisite for the outstanding performance of GNNs is the availability of complete graph information, i.e., node features and graph structure, which is frequently unmet in real-world scenarios since graphs are often incomplete due to various uncontrollable factors. Existing approaches only focus on dealing with either incomplete features or incomplete structure, which leads to performance loss inevitably. To address this issue, this study proposes a mutual dual-stream graph neural network (MDS-GNN), which implements a mutual benefit learning between features and structure. Its main ideas are as follows: a) reconstructing the missing node features based on the initial incomplete graph structure; b) generating an augmented global graph based on the reconstructed node features, and propagating the incomplete node features on this global graph; and c) utilizing contrastive learning to make the dual-stream process mutually benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MDS-GNN on incomplete graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Channel Latent Factor Analysis Enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04838v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful learning methods for recommender systems owing to their robustness in handling complicated user-item interactions. Recently, the integration of contrastive learning with GNNs has demonstrated remarkable performance in recommender systems to handle the issue of highly sparse user-item interaction data. Yet, some available graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques employ stochastic augmentation, i.e., nodes or edges are randomly perturbed on the user-item bipartite graph to construct contrastive views. Such a stochastic augmentation strategy not only brings noise perturbation but also cannot utilize global collaborative signals effectively. To address it, this study proposes a latent factor analysis (LFA) enhanced GCL approach, named LFA-GCL. Our model exclusively incorporates LFA to implement the unconstrained structural refinement, thereby obtaining an augmented global collaborative graph accurately without introducing noise signals. Experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed LFA-GCL outperforms the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Rule-Induced Subgraph Representations for Inductive Relation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07088v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive relation prediction (IRP) -- where entities can be different during training and inference -- has shown great power for completing evolving knowledge graphs. Existing works mainly focus on using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the representation of the subgraph induced from the target link, which can be seen as an implicit rule-mining process to measure the plausibility of the target link. However, these methods cannot differentiate the target link and other links during message passing, hence the final subgraph representation will contain irrelevant rule information to the target link, which reduces the reasoning performance and severely hinders the applications for real-world scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel \textit{single-source edge-wise} GNN model to learn the \textbf{R}ule-induc\textbf{E}d \textbf{S}ubgraph represen\textbf{T}ations (\textbf{REST}), which encodes relevant rules and eliminates irrelevant rules within the subgraph. Specifically, we propose a \textit{single-source} initialization approach to initialize edge features only for the target link, which guarantees the relevance of mined rules and target link. Then we propose several RNN-based functions for \textit{edge-wise} message passing to model the sequential property of mined rules. REST is a simple and effective approach with theoretical support to learn the \textit{rule-induced subgraph representation}. Moreover, REST does not need node labeling, which significantly accelerates the subgraph preprocessing time by up to \textbf{11.66$\times$}. Experiments on inductive relation prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our REST. Our code is available at https://github.com/smart-lty/REST.</p></details> |  |

MAPF finds a wide range of applications in various domains, including aerial swarms, autonomous warehouse robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Current approaches to MAPF generally fall into two main categories: centralized and decentralized planning. Centralized planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the number of agents or states increases and thus does not scale well in large and complex environments. On the other hand, decentralized planning enables agents to engage in real-time path planning within a partially observable environment, demonstrating implicit coordination. However, they suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dense environments. In this paper, we introduce CRAMP, a novel crowd-aware decentralized reinforcement learning approach to address this problem by enabling efficient local communication among agents via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), facilitating situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in congested environments. We test CRAMP on simulated environments and demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized methods for MAPF on various metrics. CRAMP improves the solution quality up to 59% measured in makespan and collision count, and up to 35% improvement in success rate in comparison to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Its importance ranges from the fundamentals of chemical reactions to the design of new therapies and materials. Previous molecular machine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features, and simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse representations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the molecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work introduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into molecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects. We show that the explicit addition of stereoelectronic interactions significantly improves the performance of molecular machine learning models. Furthermore, stereoelectronics-infused representations can be learned and deployed with a tailored double graph neural network workflow, enabling its application to any downstream molecular machine learning task. Finally, we show that the learned representations allow for facile stereoelectronic evaluation of previously intractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular design.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Understanding and modeling job marketplace can benefit both job seekers and employers, ultimately contributing to the greater good of the society. However, existing graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have shallow understandings of the associated textual features and heterogeneous relations. To address the above challenges, we propose PLM4Job, a job marketplace foundation model that tightly couples pretrained language models (PLM) with job market graph, aiming to fully utilize the pretrained knowledge and reasoning ability to model member/job textual features as well as various member-job relations simultaneously. In the pretraining phase, we propose a heterogeneous ego-graph-based prompting strategy to model and aggregate member/job textual features based on the topological structure around the target member/job node, where entity type embeddings and graph positional embeddings are introduced accordingly to model different entities and their heterogeneous relations. Meanwhile, a proximity-aware attention alignment strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the attention of the PLM on ego-graph node tokens in the prompt, such that the attention can be better aligned with job marketplace semantics. Extensive experiments at LinkedIn demonstrate the effectiveness of PLM4Job.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CIKM'24 applied research track</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Language and Graph Learning of Adsorption Configuration in Catalysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07408v3)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adsorption energy is a reactivity descriptor that must be accurately predicted for effective machine learning (ML) application in catalyst screening. This process involves determining the lowest energy across various adsorption configurations on a catalytic surface, which can exhibit very similar energy values. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in computing the energy of catalyst systems, they rely heavily on atomic spatial coordinates. In contrast, transformer-based language models can directly use human-readable text inputs, potentially bypassing the need for detailed atomic positions. However, these language models often struggle with accurately predicting the energy of adsorption configurations. Our study addresses this limitation by introducing a self-supervised multi-modal learning approach called graph-assisted pretraining, which connects well-established GNNs with emerging language model applications. This method reduces the MAE of energy prediction for adsorption configurations by about 10%. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that graph-assisted pretraining enhances fine-tuning with different datasets, indicating the transferability of this approach. This method also redirects the model's attention toward adsorption configuration, rather than individual adsorbate and catalyst information, similar to common domain knowledge. Building on this, we propose using generative large language models to create text inputs for the predictive model, based solely on chemical composition and surface orientation, without relying on exact atomic positions. This demonstrates a potential use case of language models in energy prediction without geometric information.</p></details> | manuscript updated |

The DHCE model innovates by identifying and differentiating acute and chronic diseases within a patient's visit history, constructing dynamic hypergraphs that capture the complex, high-order interactions between diseases. It surpasses traditional recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks by effectively integrating clinical event data, reflected through medical language model-assisted encoding, into a robust patient representation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, the DHCE model exhibits superior performance, significantly outpacing established baseline models in the precision of sequential diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |

Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, KGs only focus on text data, thereby neglecting other modalities such as speech. In this work, we introduce wav2graph, the first framework for supervised learning knowledge graph from speech data. Our pipeline are straightforward: (1) constructing a KG based on transcribed spoken utterances and a named entity database, (2) converting KG into embedding vectors, and (3) training graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification and link prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments conducted in inductive and transductive learning contexts using state-of-the-art GNN models, we provide baseline results and error analysis for node classification and link prediction tasks on human transcripts and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, including evaluations using both encoder-based and decoder-based node embeddings, as well as monolingual and multilingual acoustic pre-trained models. All related code, data, and models are published online.</p></details> | Preprint, 32 pages |

To address this challenge, we introduce the Merge Tree Neural Network (MTNN), a learned neural network model designed for merge tree comparison. The MTNN enables rapid and high-quality similarity computation. We first demonstrate how to train graph neural networks, which emerged as effective encoders for graphs, in order to produce embeddings of merge trees in vector spaces for efficient similarity comparison. Next, we formulate the novel MTNN model that further improves the similarity comparisons by integrating the tree and node embeddings with a new topological attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real-world data in different domains and examine our model's generalizability across various datasets. Our experimental analysis demonstrates our approach's superiority in accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we speed up the prior state-of-the-art by more than $100\times$ on the benchmark datasets while maintaining an error rate below $0.1\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Sequence Neural Networks for Dynamic Traffic Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04131v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic assignment and traffic flow prediction provide critical insights for urban planning, traffic management, and the development of intelligent transportation systems. An efficient model for calculating traffic flows over the entire transportation network could provide a more detailed and realistic understanding of traffic dynamics. However, existing traffic prediction approaches, such as those utilizing graph neural networks, are typically limited to locations where sensors are deployed and cannot predict traffic flows beyond sensor locations. To alleviate this limitation, inspired by fundamental relationship that exists between link flows and the origin-destination (OD) travel demands, we proposed the Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Graph Sequence Network (HSTGSN). HSTGSN exploits dependency between origin and destination nodes, even when it is long-range, and learns implicit vehicle route choices under different origin-destination demands. This model is based on a heterogeneous graph which consists of road links, OD links (virtual links connecting origins and destinations) and a spatio-temporal graph encoder-decoder that captures the spatio-temporal relationship between OD demands and flow distribution. We will show how the graph encoder-decoder is able to recover the incomplete information in the OD demand, by using node embedding from the graph decoder to predict the temporal changes in flow distribution. Using extensive experimental studies on real-world networks with complete/incomplete OD demands, we demonstrate that our method can not only capture the implicit spatio-temporal relationship between link traffic flows and OD demands but also achieve accurate prediction performance and generalization capability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

This paper introduces subgraph queries as a new task for deep graph learning. Unlike traditional graph prediction tasks that focus on individual components like link prediction or node classification, subgraph queries jointly predict the components of a target subgraph based on evidence that is represented by an observed subgraph. For instance, a subgraph query can predict a set of target links and/or node labels. To answer subgraph queries, we utilize a probabilistic deep Graph Generative Model. Specifically, we inductively train a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) model, augmented to represent a joint distribution over links, node features and labels. Bayesian optimization is used to tune a weighting for the relative importance of links, node features and labels in a specific domain. We describe a deterministic and a sampling-based inference method for estimating subgraph probabilities from the VGAE generative graph distribution, without retraining, in zero-shot fashion. For evaluation, we apply the inference methods on a range of subgraph queries on six benchmark datasets. We find that inference from a model achieves superior predictive performance, surpassing independent prediction baselines with improvements in AUC scores ranging from 0.06 to 0.2 points, depending on the dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2024</p></details> |

However, what kind of inherent graph properties e.g. graph proximity, graph structural information has been encoded into graph representation learning for downstream tasks is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel graph probing framework (GraphProbe) to investigate and interpret whether the family of graph learning methods has encoded different levels of knowledge in graph representation learning. Based on the intrinsic properties of graphs, we design three probes to systematically investigate the graph representation learning process from different perspectives, respectively the node-wise level, the path-wise level, and the structural level. We construct a thorough evaluation benchmark with nine representative graph learning methods from random walk based approaches, basic graph neural networks and self-supervised graph methods, and probe them on six benchmark datasets for node classification, link prediction and graph classification. The experimental evaluation verify that GraphProbe can estimate the capability of graph representation learning. Remaking results have been concluded: GCN and WeightedGCN methods are relatively versatile methods achieving better results with respect to different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Over-smoothing: Uncovering the Trainability Challenges in Deep Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03669v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The drastic performance degradation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the depth of the graph propagation layers exceeds 8-10 is widely attributed to a phenomenon of Over-smoothing. Although recent research suggests that Over-smoothing may not be the dominant reason for such a performance degradation, they have not provided rigorous analysis from a theoretical view, which warrants further investigation. In this paper, we systematically analyze the real dominant problem in deep GNNs and identify the issues that these GNNs towards addressing Over-smoothing essentially work on via empirical experiments and theoretical gradient analysis. We theoretically prove that the difficult training problem of deep MLPs is actually the main challenge, and various existing methods that supposedly tackle Over-smoothing actually improve the trainability of MLPs, which is the main reason for their performance gains. Our further investigation into trainability issues reveals that properly constrained smaller upper bounds of gradient flow notably enhance the trainability of GNNs. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate consistency between our theoretical findings and empirical evidence. Our analysis provides new insights in constructing deep graph models.</p></details> | CIKM2024 |

Accurately detecting AD, especially in the early stage, represents a high research priority. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive impairments that are related to alterations in brain functional connectivity (FC). Based on this association, many studies have been published over the decades using FC and machine learning to differentiate AD from healthy aging. The most recent development in this detection method highlights the use of graph neural network (GNN) as the brain functionality analysis. In this paper, we proposed a stack of spatio-temporal feature extraction and graph generation based AD classification model using resting state fMRI. The proposed multi-level generated connectome (MLC) based graph convolutional network (GCN) (MLC-GCN) contains a multi-graph generation block and a GCN prediction block. The multi-graph generation block consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature extraction layers for extracting spatio-temporal rsfMRI features at different depths and building the corresponding connectomes. The GCN prediction block takes the learned multi-level connectomes to build and optimize GCNs at each level and concatenates the learned graphical features as the final predicting features for AD classification. Through independent cohort validations, MLC-GCN shows better performance for differentiating MCI, AD, and normal aging than state-of-art GCN and rsfMRI based AD classifiers. The proposed MLC-GCN also showed high explainability in terms of learning clinically reasonable connectome node and connectivity features from two independent datasets. While we only tested MLC-GCN on AD, the basic rsfMRI-based multi-level learned GCN based outcome prediction strategy is valid for other diseases or clinical outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELIEF: Reinforcement Learning Empowered Graph Feature Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03195v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm has recently extended its generalization ability and data efficiency to graph representation learning, following its achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CADRL: Category-aware Dual-agent Reinforcement Learning for Explainable Recommendations over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03166v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely adopted to mitigate data sparsity and address cold-start issues in recommender systems. While existing KGs-based recommendation methods can predict user preferences and demands, they fall short in generating explicit recommendation paths and lack explainability. As a step beyond the above methods, recent advancements utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to find suitable items for a given user via explainable recommendation paths. However, the performance of these solutions is still limited by the following two points. (1) Lack of ability to capture contextual dependencies from neighboring information. (2) The excessive reliance on short recommendation paths due to efficiency concerns. To surmount these challenges, we propose a category-aware dual-agent reinforcement learning (CADRL) model for explainable recommendations over KGs. Specifically, our model comprises two components: (1) a category-aware gated graph neural network that jointly captures context-aware item representations from neighboring entities and categories, and (2) a dual-agent RL framework where two agents efficiently traverse long paths to search for suitable items. Finally, experimental results show that CADRL outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGMA: Similarity-based Efficient Global Aggregation for Heterophilous Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09958v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) realize great success in graph learning but suffer from performance loss when meeting heterophily, i.e. neighboring nodes are dissimilar, due to their local and uniform aggregation. Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains 5$\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset \emph{pokec} with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</p></details> |  |

There is a growing demand for vector representations of stock, i.e., stock embedding, in wealth management sectors, and the method has been applied to various tasks such as stock price prediction, portfolio optimization, and similar fund identifications. Stock embeddings have the advantage of enabling the quantification of relative relationships between stocks, and they can extract useful information from unstructured data such as text and network data. In this study, we propose stock embedding enhanced with textual and network information (SETN) using a domain-adaptive pre-trained transformer-based model to embed textual information and a graph neural network model to grasp network information. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on related company information extraction tasks. We also demonstrate that stock embeddings obtained from the proposed model perform better in creating thematic funds than those obtained from baseline methods, providing a promising pathway for various applications in the wealth management industry.</p></details> |  |

However, there are limited studies investigating privacy protection in GNNs. In this work, we propose a learning framework that can provide node privacy at the user level, while incurring low utility loss. We focus on a decentralized notion of Differential Privacy, namely Local Differential Privacy, and apply randomization mechanisms to perturb both feature and label data at the node level before the data is collected by a central server for model training. Specifically, we investigate the application of randomization mechanisms in high-dimensional feature settings and propose an LDP protocol with strict privacy guarantees. Based on frequency estimation in statistical analysis of randomized data, we develop reconstruction methods to approximate features and labels from perturbed data. We also formulate this learning framework to utilize frequency estimates of graph clusters to supervise the training procedure at a sub-graph level. Extensive experiments on real-world and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the validity of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining</p></details> |

| **[Algorithm-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Leakage Detection and Localization in Water Distribution Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02797v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting and localizing leakages is a significant challenge for the efficient and sustainable management of water distribution networks (WDN). Leveraging the inherent graph structure of WDNs, recent approaches have used graph-based data-driven methods. However, these methods often learn shortcuts that work well with in-distribution data but fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data. To address this limitation and inspired by the perfect generalization ability of classical algorithms, we propose an algorithm-informed graph neural network (AIGNN). Recognizing that WDNs function as flow networks, incorporating max-flow information can be beneficial for inferring pressures. In the proposed framework, we first train AIGNN to emulate the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for solving max-flow problems. This algorithmic knowledge is then transferred to address the pressure estimation problem in WDNs. Two AIGNNs are deployed, one to reconstruct pressure based on the current measurements, and another to predict pressure based on previous measurements. Leakages are detected and localized by comparing the outputs of the reconstructor and the predictor. By pretraining AIGNNs to reason like algorithms, they are expected to extract more task-relevant and generalizable features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm-informed approach achieves superior results with better generalization ability compared to GNNs that do not incorporate algorithmic knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Expressiveness through Preprocessed Graph Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11714v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant method for analyzing graph-structured data. However, canonical GNNs have limited expressive power and generalization capability, thus triggering the development of more expressive yet computationally intensive methods. One such approach is to create a series of perturbed versions of input graphs and then repeatedly conduct multiple message-passing operations on all variations during training. Despite their expressive power, this approach does not scale well on larger graphs. To address this scalability issue, we introduce Scalable Expressiveness through Preprocessed Graph Perturbation (SE2P). This model offers a flexible, configurable balance between scalability and generalizability with four distinct configuration classes. At one extreme, the configuration prioritizes scalability through minimal learnable feature extraction and extensive preprocessing; at the other extreme, it enhances generalizability with more learnable feature extractions, though this increases scalability costs. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the generalizability and scalability of SE2P variants compared to various state-of-the-art benchmarks. Our results indicate that, depending on the chosen SE2P configuration, the model can enhance generalizability compared to benchmarks while achieving significant speed improvements of up to 8-fold.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

Our study builds upon the approximation results derived from the $K$-functional. We establish a theoretical framework to assess the lower bounds of approximation for target functions using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and examine the over-smoothing phenomenon commonly observed in these networks. Initially, we introduce the concept of a $K$-functional on graphs, establishing its equivalence to the modulus of smoothness. We then analyze a typical type of GCN to demonstrate how the high-frequency energy of the output decays, an indicator of over-smoothing. This analysis provides theoretical insights into the nature of over-smoothing within GCNs. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for the approximation of target functions by GCNs, which is governed by the modulus of smoothness of these functions. This finding offers a new perspective on the approximation capabilities of GCNs. In our numerical experiments, we analyze several widely applied GCNs and observe the phenomenon of energy decay. These observations corroborate our theoretical results on exponential decay order.</p></details> |  |

This thesis puts forth notions of rank as key for developing a theory of deep learning, focusing on the fundamental aspects of generalization and expressiveness. In particular, we establish that gradient-based training can induce an implicit regularization towards low rank for several neural network architectures, and demonstrate empirically that this phenomenon may facilitate an explanation of generalization over natural data (e.g., audio, images, and text). Then, we characterize the ability of graph neural networks to model interactions via a notion of rank, which is commonly used for quantifying entanglement in quantum physics. A central tool underlying these results is a connection between neural networks and tensor factorizations. Practical implications of our theory for designing explicit regularization schemes and data preprocessing algorithms are presented.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

In this work, we propose a framework that achieves the aforementioned by generating semantically edited inputs, known as counterfactual interventions, which change the model prediction, thus providing a form of counterfactual explanations for the model. We test our framework on two NLP tasks - binary sentiment classification and topic classification - and show that the generated edits are contrastive, fluent and minimal, while the whole process remains significantly faster that other state-of-the-art counterfactual editors.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bilateral Trade Flow Prediction by Gravity-informed Graph Auto-encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01938v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The gravity models has been studied to analyze interaction between two objects such as trade amount between a pair of countries, human migration between a pair of countries and traffic flow between two cities. Particularly in the international trade, predicting trade amount is instrumental to industry and government in business decision making and determining economic policies. Whereas the gravity models well captures such interaction between objects, the model simplifies the interaction to extract essential relationships or needs handcrafted features to drive the models. Recent studies indicate the connection between graph neural networks (GNNs) and the gravity models in international trade. However, to our best knowledge, hardly any previous studies in the this domain directly predicts trade amount by GNNs. We propose GGAE (Gravity-informed Graph Auto-encoder) and its surrogate model, which is inspired by the gravity model, showing trade amount prediction by the gravity model can be formulated as an edge weight prediction problem in GNNs and solved by GGAE and its surrogate model. Furthermore, we conducted experiments to indicate GGAE with GNNs can improve trade amount prediction compared to the traditional gravity model by considering complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined random walk with unifying memory (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node. Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test. On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invariant Graph Learning Meets Information Bottleneck for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01697v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a major challenge in graph learning since graph neural networks (GNNs) often suffer from severe performance degradation under distribution shifts. Invariant learning, aiming to extract invariant features across varied distributions, has recently emerged as a promising approach for OOD generation. Despite the great success of invariant learning in OOD problems for Euclidean data (i.e., images), the exploration within graph data remains constrained by the complex nature of graphs. Existing studies, such as data augmentation or causal intervention, either suffer from disruptions to invariance during the graph manipulation process or face reliability issues due to a lack of supervised signals for causal parts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called Invariant Graph Learning based on Information bottleneck theory (InfoIGL), to extract the invariant features of graphs and enhance models' generalization ability to unseen distributions. Specifically, InfoIGL introduces a redundancy filter to compress task-irrelevant information related to environmental factors. Cooperating with our designed multi-level contrastive learning, we maximize the mutual information among graphs of the same class in the downstream classification tasks, preserving invariant features for prediction to a great extent. An appealing feature of InfoIGL is its strong generalization ability without depending on supervised signal of invariance. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under OOD generalization for graph classification tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach, together with Message Passing Graph Neural Networks. We propose a Neural Bond graph Encoder (NBgE) producing multi-physics-informed representations that can be fed into any task-specific model. It provides a unified way to integrate both data and architecture biases in deep learning.

While graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful in encoding graph structures, existing GNN-based methods for community detection are limited by requiring knowledge of the number of communities in advance, in addition to lacking a proper probabilistic formulation to handle uncertainty. We propose a simple framework for amortized community detection, which addresses both of these issues by combining the expressive power of GNNs with recent methods for amortized clustering. Our models consist of a graph representation backbone that extracts structural information and an amortized clustering network that naturally handles variable numbers of clusters. Both components combine into well-defined models of the posterior distribution of graph communities and are jointly optimized given labeled graphs. At inference time, the models yield parallel samples from the posterior of community labels, quantifying uncertainty in a principled way. We evaluate several models from our framework on synthetic and real datasets, and demonstrate improved performance compared to previous methods. As a separate contribution, we extend recent amortized probabilistic clustering architectures by adding attention modules, which yield further improvements on community detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Structured Probabilistic Inference & Generative Modeling workshop of ICML 2024, Vienna, Austria</p></details> |

The nanodevices face size and power constraints that produce erroneous raw data for localization purposes. On-body anchors receive this data, and use it to derive the locations of diagnostic events of interest. Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been recently proposed for this task, yet they are currently restricted to a reference bloodstream of a resting patient. As such, they are unable to deal with the physical diversity of patients' bloodstreams and cannot provide continuous monitoring due to changes in individual patient's activities. Toward addressing these issues for the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) flow-guided localization approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a pipeline for GNN adaptation based on individual physiological indicators including height, weight, and heart rate. Our results indicate that the proposed adaptions are beneficial in reconciling the individual differences between bloodstreams and activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, 16 references, accepted at ACM NanoCom'25</p></details> |

Universal control policies, applicable across diverse robot morphologies, promise to mitigate this challenge. Predominantly, models based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformers are employed, owing to their effectiveness in capturing relational dynamics across a robot's limbs. However, these models typically employ homogeneous graph structures that overlook the functional diversity of different limbs. To bridge this gap, we introduce HeteroMorpheus, a novel method based on heterogeneous graph Transformer. This method uniquely addresses limb heterogeneity, fostering better representation of robot dynamics of various morphologies. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the superiority of HeteroMorpheus against state-of-the-art methods in the capability of policy generalization, including zero-shot generalization and sample-efficient transfer to unfamiliar robot morphologies.</p></details> |  |

The numerical evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves close performance to the centralized greedy colouring sub-band allocation heuristic with lower computational time complexity. In addition, it incurs reduced signalling overhead compared to iterative optimization heuristics that require all the mutual interfering channel information.

| **[SAM-guided Graph Cut for 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08372v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of 3D instance segmentation by simultaneously leveraging 3D geometric and multi-view image information. Many previous works have applied deep learning techniques to 3D point clouds for instance segmentation. However, these methods often failed to generalize to various types of scenes due to the scarcity and low-diversity of labeled 3D point cloud data. Some recent works have attempted to lift 2D instance segmentations to 3D within a bottom-up framework. The inconsistency in 2D instance segmentations among views can substantially degrade the performance of 3D segmentation. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D-to-2D query framework to effectively exploit 2D segmentation models for 3D instance segmentation. Specifically, we pre-segment the scene into several superpoints in 3D, formulating the task into a graph cut problem. The superpoint graph is constructed based on 2D segmentation models, where node features are obtained from multi-view image features and edge weights are computed based on multi-view segmentation results, enabling the better generalization ability. To process the graph, we train a graph neural network using pseudo 3D labels from 2D segmentation models. Experimental results on the ScanNet, ScanNet++ and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust segmentation performance and can generalize across different types of scenes.

However, existing approaches struggle with limitations in insufficient annotations and suboptimal architecture design. For instance, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-squashing, causing the loss of important structural details in molecules, thus impairing molecular representations. In this work, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-MolKAN and its augmented variant, GNN-MolKAN+, that integrate the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architecture from AI + Science into GNNs to address these challenges. Additionally, we introduce Adaptive FastKAN (AdFastKAN), an advanced KAN that offers increased stability and speed, further enhancing the performance of standard GNNs. Notably, our approach holds three key benefits: 1) Superior Performance: GNN-MolKAN and GNN-MolKAN+ demonstrate superior prediction ability, robust generalization to unseen scaffolds, and versatile transferability across different GNN architectures. 2) Efficiency: These models require less computational time and fewer parameters while matching or surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised methods. 3) Few-shot Learning Ability: GNN-MolKAN demonstrates great potential in few-shot learning scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 6.97% across few-shot benchmarks. Overall, we validate our architecture on 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot learning datasets, consistently achieving highly competitive results across all of them.</p></details> |  |

Compared with structural and functional MRI-based biomarkers for the disease, electroencephalography (EEG) can provide more accessible alternatives for clinical insights. While deep learning (DL) techniques have provided excellent outcomes, many techniques fail to model spatial information and dynamic brain connectivity, and face challenges in robust feature learning, limited data sizes, and poor explainability. To address these issues, we proposed a novel graph neural network (GNN) technique for explainable PD detection using resting state EEG. Specifically, we employ structured global convolutions with contrastive learning to better model complex features with limited data, a novel multi-head graph structure learner to capture the non-Euclidean structure of EEG data, and a head-wise gradient-weighted graph attention explainer to offer neural connectivity insights. We developed and evaluated our method using the UC San Diego Parkinson's disease EEG dataset, and achieved 69.40% detection accuracy in subject-wise leave-one-out cross-validation while generating intuitive explanations for the learnt graph topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MLCN 2024</p></details> |

Most previous methods explore a single noise source, recovering corrupt node embedding by reliable structures bias or developing structure learning with reliable node features. However, the noises and attacks may come from both structures and features in graphs, making the graph denoising a dilemma and challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a unified graph denoising (UGD) framework to unravel the deadlock between structure and feature denoising. Specifically, a high-order neighborhood proximity evaluation method is proposed to recognize noisy edges, considering features may be perturbed simultaneously. Moreover, we propose to refine noisy features with reconstruction based on a graph auto-encoder. An iterative updating algorithm is further designed to optimize the framework and acquire a clean graph, thus enabling robust graph learning for downstream tasks. Our UGD framework is self-supervised and can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play module. We carry out extensive experiments, which proves the effectiveness and advantages of our method.

| **[Genetic Algorithms with Neural Cost Predictor for Solving Hierarchical Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14157v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When vehicle routing decisions are intertwined with higher-level decisions, the resulting optimization problems pose significant challenges for computation. Examples are the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), where customers are assigned to depots before delivery, and the capacitated location routing problem (CLRP), where the locations of depots should be determined first. A simple and straightforward approach for such hierarchical problems would be to separate the higher-level decisions from the complicated vehicle routing decisions. For each higher-level decision candidate, we may evaluate the underlying vehicle routing problems to assess the candidate. As this approach requires solving vehicle routing problems multiple times, it has been regarded as impractical in most cases. We propose a novel deep-learning-based approach called Genetic Algorithm with Neural Cost Predictor (GANCP) to tackle the challenge and simplify algorithm developments. For each higher-level decision candidate, we predict the objective function values of the underlying vehicle routing problems using a pre-trained graph neural network without actually solving the routing problems. In particular, our proposed neural network learns the objective values of the HGS-CVRP open-source package that solves capacitated vehicle routing problems. Our numerical experiments show that this simplified approach is effective and efficient in generating high-quality solutions for both MDVRP and CLRP and has the potential to expedite algorithm developments for complicated hierarchical problems. We provide computational results evaluated in the standard benchmark instances used in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00295v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received extensive research attention due to their powerful information aggregation capabilities. Despite the success of GNNs, most of them suffer from the popularity bias issue in a graph caused by a small number of popular categories. Additionally, real graph datasets always contain incorrect node labels, which hinders GNNs from learning effective node representations. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been shown to be effective in solving the above problems for node classification tasks. Most existing GCL methods are implemented by randomly removing edges and nodes to create multiple contrasting views, and then maximizing the mutual information (MI) between these contrasting views to improve the node feature representation. However, maximizing the mutual information between multiple contrasting views may lead the model to learn some redundant information irrelevant to the node classification task. To tackle this issue, we propose an effective Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck (CGRL) for node classification, which can adaptively learn to mask the nodes and edges in the graph to obtain the optimal graph structure representation. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the information bottleneck theory into GCLs to remove redundant information in multiple contrasting views while retaining as much information as possible about node classification. Moreover, we add noise perturbations to the original views and reconstruct the augmented views by constructing adversarial views to improve the robustness of node feature representation. Extensive experiments on real-world public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Multi-Modal Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning via Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00290v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of the era of foundation models, pre-training and fine-tuning have become common paradigms. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has garnered widespread attention due to its better balance between the number of learnable parameters and performance. However, some current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods only model a single modality and lack the utilization of structural knowledge in downstream tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-modal parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on graph networks. Each image is fed into a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to generate a text description. The image and its corresponding text description are then processed by a frozen image encoder and text encoder to generate image features and text features, respectively. A graph is constructed based on the similarity of the multi-modal feature nodes, and knowledge and relationships relevant to these features are extracted from each node. Additionally, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization is incorporated into the loss function to mitigate the problem of forgetting during task learning. The proposed model achieves test accuracies on the OxfordPets, Flowers102, and Food101 datasets that improve by 4.45%, 2.92%, and 0.23%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/yunche0/GA-Net/tree/master.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDFGNN: a Systematic Design of Cache-based Distributed Full-Batch Graph Neural Network Training with Communication Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00232v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Unsupervised to Few-shot Graph Anomaly Detection: A Multi-scale Contrastive Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05525v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection from graph data is an important data mining task in many applications such as social networks, finance, and e-commerce. Existing efforts in graph anomaly detection typically only consider the information in a single scale (view), thus inevitably limiting their capability in capturing anomalous patterns in complex graph data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, graph ANomaly dEtection framework with Multi-scale cONtrastive lEarning (ANEMONE in short). By using a graph neural network as a backbone to encode the information from multiple graph scales (views), we learn better representation for nodes in a graph. In maximizing the agreements between instances at both the patch and context levels concurrently, we estimate the anomaly score of each node with a statistical anomaly estimator according to the degree of agreement from multiple perspectives. To further exploit a handful of ground-truth anomalies (few-shot anomalies) that may be collected in real-life applications, we further propose an extended algorithm, ANEMONE-FS, to integrate valuable information in our method. We conduct extensive experiments under purely unsupervised settings and few-shot anomaly detection settings, and we demonstrate that the proposed method ANEMONE and its variant ANEMONE-FS consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
