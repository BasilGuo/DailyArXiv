| **[Estimating Breakpoints between Climate States in Paleoclimate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08336v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a statistical approach for identifying transitions between climate states, referred to as breakpoints, using well-established econometric tools. We analyse a 67.1 million year record of the oxygen isotope ratio delta-O-18 derived from benthic foraminifera. The dataset is presented in Westerhold et al. (2020), where the authors use recurrence analysis to identify six climate states. We consider several model specifications. Fixing the number of breakpoints to five, the resulting breakpoint estimates closely align with those identified by Westerhold et al. (2020) across various data binning frequencies and model specifications. Treating the number of breakpoints as a parameter to be estimated results in statistical justification for more than five breakpoints in the time series. Our approach offers the advantage of constructing confidence intervals for the breakpoints, and it allows testing for the number of breakpoints present in the time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors in alphabetical order</p></details> |
| **[DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TAD) faces a significant challenge due to the scarcity of labelled data, which hinders the development of accurate detection models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by leveraging a labelled dataset from a related domain to detect anomalies in a target dataset. Existing domain adaptation techniques assume that the number of anomalous classes does not change between the source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD) model to address this issue by combining UDA and contrastive representation learning. DACAD's approach includes an anomaly injection mechanism that introduces various types of synthetic anomalies, enhancing the model's ability to generalise across unseen anomalous classes in different domains. This method significantly broadens the model's adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we propose a supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and a self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, improving comprehensive feature representation learning and extraction of domain-invariant features. Finally, an effective Centre-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) is proposed specifically for anomaly detection, facilitating accurate learning of normal boundaries in the source domain. Our extensive evaluation across multiple real-world datasets against leading models in time series anomaly detection and UDA underscores DACAD's effectiveness. The results validate DACAD's superiority in transferring knowledge across domains and its potential to mitigate the challenge of limited labelled data in time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Variational quantization for state space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11117v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting tasks using large datasets gathering thousands of heterogeneous time series is a crucial statistical problem in numerous sectors. The main challenge is to model a rich variety of time series, leverage any available external signals and provide sharp predictions with statistical guarantees. In this work, we propose a new forecasting model that combines discrete state space hidden Markov models with recent neural network architectures and training procedures inspired by vector quantized variational autoencoders. We introduce a variational discrete posterior distribution of the latent states given the observations and a two-stage training procedure to alternatively train the parameters of the latent states and of the emission distributions. By learning a collection of emission laws and temporarily activating them depending on the hidden process dynamics, the proposed method allows to explore large datasets and leverage available external signals. We assess the performance of the proposed method using several datasets and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reuse out-of-year data to enhance land cover mappingvia feature disentanglement and contrastive learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11114v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely up-to-date land use/land cover (LULC) maps play a pivotal role in supporting agricultural territory management, environmental monitoring and facilitating well-informed and sustainable decision-making. Typically, when creating a land cover (LC) map, precise ground truth data is collected through time-consuming and expensive field campaigns. This data is then utilized in conjunction with satellite image time series (SITS) through advanced machine learning algorithms to get the final map. Unfortunately, each time this process is repeated (e.g., annually over a region to estimate agricultural production or potential biodiversity loss), new ground truth data must be collected, leading to the complete disregard of previously gathered reference data despite the substantial financial and time investment they have required. How to make value of historical data, from the same or similar study sites, to enhance the current LULC mapping process constitutes a significant challenge that could enable the financial and human-resource efforts invested in previous data campaigns to be valued again. Aiming to tackle this important challenge, we here propose a deep learning framework based on recent advances in domain adaptation and generalization to combine remote sensing and reference data coming from two different domains (e.g. historical data and fresh ones) to ameliorate the current LC mapping process. Our approach, namely REFeD (data Reuse with Effective Feature Disentanglement for land cover mapping), leverages a disentanglement strategy, based on contrastive learning, where invariant and specific per-domain features are derived to recover the intrinsic information related to the downstream LC mapping task and alleviate possible distribution shifts between domains. Additionally, REFeD is equipped with an effective supervision scheme where feature disentanglement is further enforced via multiple levels of supervision at different granularities. The experimental assessment over two study areas covering extremely diverse and contrasted landscapes, namely Koumbia (located in the West-Africa region, in Burkina Faso) and Centre Val de Loire (located in centre Europe, France), underlines the quality of our framework and the obtained findings demonstrate that out-of-year information coming from the same (or similar) study site, at different periods of time, can constitute a valuable additional source of information to enhance the LC mapping process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier-Mixed Window Attention: Accelerating Informer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00493v3)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a fast local-global window-based attention method to accelerate Informer for long sequence time-series forecasting. While window attention being local is a considerable computational saving, it lacks the ability to capture global token information which is compensated by a subsequent Fourier transform block. Our method, named FWin, does not rely on query sparsity hypothesis and an empirical approximation underlying the ProbSparse attention of Informer. Through experiments on univariate and multivariate datasets, we show that FWin transformers improve the overall prediction accuracies of Informer while accelerating its inference speeds by 1.6 to 2 times. We also provide a mathematical definition of FWin attention, and prove that it is equivalent to the canonical full attention under the block diagonal invertibility (BDI) condition of the attention matrix. The BDI is shown experimentally to hold with high probability for typical benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (main), 11 pages (appendix), 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[DeepVARwT: Deep Learning for a VAR Model with Trend](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10587v3)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vector autoregressive (VAR) model has been used to describe the dependence within and across multiple time series. This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley & Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation for conditional moment models based on martingale difference divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11092v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a new estimation method for conditional moment models via the martingale difference divergence (MDD).Our MDD-based estimation method is formed in the framework of a continuum of unconditional moment restrictions. Unlike the existing estimation methods in this framework, the MDD-based estimation method adopts a non-integrable weighting function, which could grab more information from unconditional moment restrictions than the integrable weighting function to enhance the estimation efficiency. Due to the nature of shift-invariance in MDD, our MDD-based estimation method can not identify the intercept parameters. To overcome this identification issue, we further provide a two-step estimation procedure for the model with intercept parameters. Under regularity conditions, we establish the asymptotics of the proposed estimators, which are not only easy-to-implement with analytic asymptotic variances, but also applicable to time series data with an unspecified form of conditional heteroskedasticity. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed estimators by simulations and two real examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodicity in New York State COVID-19 Hospitalizations Leveraged from the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11006v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which led to an unprecedented global pandemic, has underscored the critical importance of understanding seasonal patterns. This knowledge is fundamental for decision-making in healthcare and public health domains. Investigating the presence, intensity, and precise nature of seasonal trends, as well as these temporal patterns, is essential for forecasting future occurrences, planning interventions, and making informed decisions based on the evolution of events over time. This study employs the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) to separate and analyze different periodic components by frequency in time series data, focusing on annually correlated (PC) principal components. Bootstrapping, a method used to estimate statistical sampling distributions through random sampling with replacement, is particularly useful in this context. Specifically, block bootstrapping, a model-independent resampling method suitable for time series data, is utilized. Its extensions are aimed at preserving the correlation structures inherent in PC processes. The VBPBB applies a bandpass filter to isolate the relevant PC frequency, thereby minimizing contamination from extraneous frequencies and noise. This approach significantly narrows the confidence intervals, enhancing the precision of estimated sampling distributions for the investigated periodic characteristics. Furthermore, we compared the outcomes of block bootstrapping for periodically correlated time series with VBPBB against those from more traditional bootstrapping methods. Our analysis shows VBPBB provides strong evidence of the existence of an annual seasonal PC pattern in hospitalization rates not detectible by other methods, providing timing and confidence intervals for their impact.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Motiflets -- Simple and Accurate Detection of Motifs in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03735v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series motif intuitively is a short time series that repeats itself approximately the same within a larger time series. Such motifs often represent concealed structures, such as heart beats in an ECG recording, the riff in a pop song, or sleep spindles in EEG sleep data. Motif discovery (MD) is the task of finding such motifs in a given input series. As there are varying definitions of what exactly a motif is, a number of different algorithms exist. As central parameters they all take the length l of the motif and the maximal distance r between the motif's occurrences. In practice, however, especially suitable values for r are very hard to determine upfront, and found motifs show a high variability even for very similar r values. Accordingly, finding an interesting motif requires extensive trial-and-error. In this paper, we present a different approach to the MD problem. We define k-Motiflets as the set of exactly k occurrences of a motif of length l, whose maximum pairwise distance is minimal. This turns the MD problem upside-down: The central parameter of our approach is not the distance threshold r, but the desired number of occurrence k of the motif, which we show is considerably more intuitive and easier to set. Based on this definition, we present exact and approximate algorithms for finding k-Motiflets and analyze their complexity. To further ease the use of our method, we describe statistical tools to automatically determine meaningful values for its input parameters. By evaluation on several real-world data sets and comparison to four SotA MD algorithms, we show that our proposed algorithm is both quantitatively superior to its competitors, finding larger motif sets at higher similarity, and qualitatively better, leading to clearer and easier to interpret motifs without any need for manual tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Algorithms for Causal Inference with Panel Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03489v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conducting causal inference with panel data is a core challenge in social science research. We adapt a deep neural architecture for time series forecasting (the N-BEATS algorithm) to more accurately impute the counterfactual evolution of a treated unit had treatment not occurred. Across a range of settings, the resulting estimator (``SyNBEATS'') significantly outperforms commonly employed methods (synthetic controls, two-way fixed effects), and attains comparable or more accurate performance compared to recently proposed methods (synthetic difference-in-differences, matrix completion). An implementation of this estimator is available for public use. Our results highlight how advances in the forecasting literature can be harnessed to improve causal inference in panel data settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian process learning of nonlinear dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12193v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal tasks in scientific machine learning is to represent underlying dynamical systems from time series data. Many methods for such dynamics learning explicitly require the derivatives of state data, which are not directly available and can be approximated conventionally by finite differences. However, the discrete approximations of time derivatives may result in poor estimations when state data are scarce and/or corrupted by noise, thus compromising the predictiveness of the learned dynamical models. To overcome this technical hurdle, we propose a new method that learns nonlinear dynamics through a Bayesian inference of characterizing model parameters. This method leverages a Gaussian process representation of states, and constructs a likelihood function using the correlation between state data and their derivatives, yet prevents explicit evaluations of time derivatives. Through a Bayesian scheme, a probabilistic estimate of the model parameters is given by the posterior distribution, and thus a quantification is facilitated for uncertainties from noisy state data and the learning process. Specifically, we will discuss the applicability of the proposed method to several typical scenarios for dynamical systems: identification and estimation with an affine parametrization, nonlinear parametric approximation without prior knowledge, and general parameter estimation for a given dynamical system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Optimization of 1D-CNN for Non-contact Respiration Pattern Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13035v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a deep learning-based approach for time-series respiration data classification. The dataset contains regular breathing patterns as well as various forms of abnormal breathing, obtained through non-contact incoherent light-wave sensing (LWS) technology. Given the one-dimensional (1D) nature of the data, we employed a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for classification purposes. Genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the 1D-CNN architecture to maximize classification accuracy. Addressing the computational complexity associated with training the 1D-CNN across multiple generations, we implemented transfer learning from a pre-trained model. This approach significantly reduced the computational time required for training, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the optimization process. This study contributes valuable insights into the potential applications of deep learning methodologies for enhancing respiratory anomaly detection through precise and efficient respiration classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, accepted in International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, Soft Computing, and Explainable AI (NAFIPS2024)</p></details> |
| **[Noncontact Respiratory Anomaly Detection Using Infrared Light-Wave Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03713v4)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human respiratory rate and its pattern convey essential information about the physical and psychological states of the subject. Abnormal breathing can indicate fatal health issues leading to further diagnosis and treatment. Wireless light-wave sensing (LWS) using incoherent infrared light shows promise in safe, discreet, efficient, and non-invasive human breathing monitoring without raising privacy concerns. The respiration monitoring system needs to be trained on different types of breathing patterns to identify breathing anomalies.The system must also validate the collected data as a breathing waveform, discarding any faulty data caused by external interruption, user movement, or system malfunction. To address these needs, this study simulated normal and different types of abnormal respiration using a robot that mimics human breathing patterns. Then, time-series respiration data were collected using infrared light-wave sensing technology. Three machine learning algorithms, decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, were applied to detect breathing anomalies and faulty data. Model performances were evaluated through cross-validation, assessing classification accuracy, precision and recall scores. The random forest model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 96.75% with data collected at a 0.5m distance. In general, ensemble models like random forest and XGBoost performed better than a single model in classifying the data collected at multiple distances from the light-wave sensing setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, published in IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Long-Term Multi-Energy Load Forecasting with Patchformer: A Patch and Transformer-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10458v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of increasing demands for long-term multi-energy load forecasting in real-world applications, this paper introduces Patchformer, a novel model that integrates patch embedding with encoder-decoder Transformer-based architectures. To address the limitation in existing Transformer-based models, which struggle with intricate temporal patterns in long-term forecasting, Patchformer employs patch embedding, which predicts multivariate time-series data by separating it into multiple univariate data and segmenting each of them into multiple patches. This method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture local and global semantic dependencies. The numerical analysis shows that the Patchformer obtains overall better prediction accuracy in both multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting on the novel Multi-Energy dataset and other benchmark datasets. In addition, the positive effect of the interdependence among energy-related products on the performance of long-term time-series forecasting across Patchformer and other compared models is discovered, and the superiority of the Patchformer against other models is also demonstrated, which presents a significant advancement in handling the interdependence and complexities of long-term multi-energy forecasting. Lastly, Patchformer is illustrated as the only model that follows the positive correlation between model performance and the length of the past sequence, which states its ability to capture long-range past local semantic information.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Use of Relative Validity Indices for Comparing Clustering Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10351v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relative Validity Indices (RVIs) such as the Silhouette Width Criterion, Calinski-Harabasz and Davie's Bouldin indices are the most popular tools for evaluating and optimising applications of clustering. Their ability to rank collections of candidate partitions has been used to guide the selection of the number of clusters, and to compare partitions from different clustering algorithms. Beyond these more conventional tasks, many examples can be found in the literature where RVIs have been used to compare and select other aspects of clustering approaches such as data normalisation procedures, data representation methods, and distance measures. The authors are not aware of any studies that have attempted to establish the suitability of RVIs for such comparisons. Moreover, given the impact of these aspects on pairwise similarities, it is not even immediately obvious how RVIs should be implemented when comparing these aspects. In this study, we conducted experiments with seven common RVIs on over 2.7 million clustering partitions for both synthetic and real-world datasets, encompassing feature-vector and time-series data. Our findings suggest that RVIs are not well-suited to these unconventional tasks, and that conclusions drawn from such applications may be misleading. It is recommended that normalisation procedures, representation methods, and distance measures instead be selected using external validation on high quality labelled datasets or carefully designed outcome-oriented objective criteria, both of which should be informed by relevant domain knowledge and clustering aims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intriguing Properties of Positional Encoding in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10337v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have made significant progress in time series forecasting (TSF). They primarily handle two types of tokens, i.e., temporal tokens that contain all variables of the same timestamp, and variable tokens that contain all input time points for a specific variable. Transformer-based methods rely on positional encoding (PE) to mark tokens' positions, facilitating the model to perceive the correlation between tokens. However, in TSF, research on PE remains insufficient. To address this gap, we conduct experiments and uncover intriguing properties of existing PEs in TSF: (i) The positional information injected by PEs diminishes as the network depth increases; (ii) Enhancing positional information in deep networks is advantageous for improving the model's performance; (iii) PE based on the similarity between tokens can improve the model's performance. Motivated by these findings, we introduce two new PEs: Temporal Position Encoding (T-PE) for temporal tokens and Variable Positional Encoding (V-PE) for variable tokens. Both T-PE and V-PE incorporate geometric PE based on tokens' positions and semantic PE based on the similarity between tokens but using different calculations. To leverage both the PEs, we design a Transformer-based dual-branch framework named T2B-PE. It first calculates temporal tokens' correlation and variable tokens' correlation respectively and then fuses the dual-branch features through the gated unit. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior robustness and effectiveness of T2B-PE. The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/T2B-PE}{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/T2B-PE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARE to Compare: A real-world dataset for anomaly detection in wind turbine data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10320v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in the field of predictive maintenance for wind turbines, yet the comparison of different algorithms poses a difficult task because domain specific public datasets are scarce. Many comparisons of different approaches either use benchmarks composed of data from many different domains, inaccessible data or one of the few publicly available datasets which lack detailed information about the faults. Moreover, many publications highlight a couple of case studies where fault detection was successful. With this paper we publish a high quality dataset that contains data from 36 wind turbines across 3 different wind farms as well as the most detailed fault information of any public wind turbine dataset as far as we know. The new dataset contains 89 years worth of real-world operating data of wind turbines, distributed across 44 labeled time frames for anomalies that led up to faults, as well as 51 time series representing normal behavior. Additionally, the quality of training data is ensured by turbine-status-based labels for each data point. Furthermore, we propose a new scoring method, called CARE (Coverage, Accuracy, Reliability and Earliness), which takes advantage of the information depth that is present in the dataset to identify a good all-around anomaly detection model. This score considers the anomaly detection performance, the ability to recognize normal behavior properly and the capability to raise as few false alarms as possible while simultaneously detecting anomalies early.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures |
| **[NL2KQL: From Natural Language to Kusto Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02933v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data is growing rapidly in volume and complexity. Proficiency in database query languages is pivotal for crafting effective queries. As coding assistants become more prevalent, there is significant opportunity to enhance database query languages. The Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a widely used query language for large semi-structured data such as logs, telemetries, and time-series for big data analytics platforms. This paper introduces NL2KQL an innovative framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries (NLQs) to KQL queries. The proposed NL2KQL framework includes several key components: Schema Refiner which narrows down the schema to its most pertinent elements; the Few-shot Selector which dynamically selects relevant examples from a few-shot dataset; and the Query Refiner which repairs syntactic and semantic errors in KQL queries. Additionally, this study outlines a method for generating large datasets of synthetic NLQ-KQL pairs which are valid within a specific database contexts. To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an array of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing) metrics. Through ablation studies, the significance of each framework component is examined, and the datasets used for benchmarking are made publicly available. This work is the first of its kind and is compared with available baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems via Causal Discovery from Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09871v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online unsupervised detection of anomalies is crucial to guarantee the correct operation of cyber-physical systems and the safety of humans interacting with them. State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of $>10$ different anomalies.

However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

Much existing theory on identifying the time-series signatures of nearby critical points -- such as increased variance and slower timescales -- is derived for the case of fixed, low-amplitude noise. However, real-world systems are often corrupted by unknown levels of noise that can distort these temporal signatures. Here we aimed to develop noise-robust indicators of the distance to criticality (DTC) for systems affected by dynamical noise in two cases: when the noise amplitude is fixed, or is unknown and variable across recordings. To approach this problem, we compare the ability of over 7000 candidate time-series features to track the DTC in the vicinity of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We recover existing theory in the fixed-noise case, highlighting conventional time-series features that accurately track the DTC. But in the variable-noise setting, where these conventional indicators perform poorly, we highlight new types of high-performing time-series features and show that their success is accomplished by capturing the shape of the invariant density (which depends on both the DTC and the noise amplitude) relative to the spread of fast fluctuations (which depends on the noise amplitude). We introduce a new high-performing time-series statistic, the Rescaled Auto-Density (RAD), that combines these two algorithmic components. We then use RAD to provide new evidence that brain regions higher in the visual hierarchy are positioned closer to criticality, supporting existing hypotheses about patterns of brain organization that are not detected using conventional metrics of the DTC. Our results demonstrate how large-scale algorithmic comparison can yield theoretical insights that can motivate new theory and interpretable algorithms for real-world problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main paper comprises 25 pages, with 6 figures (.pdf).

| **[Analyzing Taiwanese traffic patterns on consecutive holidays through forecast reconciliation and prediction-based anomaly detection techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09537v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores traffic patterns on Taiwanese highways during consecutive holidays and focuses on understanding Taiwanese highway traffic behavior. We propose a prediction-based detection method for finding highway traffic anomalies using reconciled ordinary least squares (OLS) forecasts and bootstrap prediction intervals. Two fundamental features of traffic flow time series -- namely, seasonality and spatial autocorrelation -- are captured by adding Fourier terms in OLS models, spatial aggregation (as a hierarchical structure mimicking the geographical division in regions, cities, and stations), and a reconciliation step. Our approach, although simple, is able to model complex traffic datasets with reasonable accuracy. Being based on OLS, it is efficient and permits avoiding the computational burden of more complex methods. Analyses of Taiwan's consecutive holidays in 2019, 2020, and 2021 (73 days) showed strong variations in anomalies across different directions and highways. Specifically, we detected some areas and highways comprising a high number of traffic anomalies (north direction-central and southern regions-highways No. 1 and 3, south direction-southern region-highway No.3), and others with generally normal traffic (east and west direction). These results could provide important decision-support information to traffic authorities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural McKean-Vlasov Processes: Distributional Dependence in Diffusion Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09402v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) provide a mathematical description of the behavior of an infinite number of interacting particles by imposing a dependence on the particle density. As such, we study the influence of explicitly including distributional information in the parameterization of the SDE. We propose a series of semi-parametric methods for representing MV-SDEs, and corresponding estimators for inferring parameters from data based on the properties of the MV-SDE. We analyze the characteristics of the different architectures and estimators, and consider their applicability in relevant machine learning problems. We empirically compare the performance of the different architectures and estimators on real and synthetic datasets for time series and probabilistic modeling. The results suggest that explicitly including distributional dependence in the parameterization of the SDE is effective in modeling temporal data with interaction under an exchangeability assumption while maintaining strong performance for standard It\^o-SDEs due to the richer class of probability flows associated with MV-SDEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in AISTATS 2024</p></details> |

A novel method is introduced based on recasting the optimisation of scoring rules as an assignment problem, which is solved using quadratic programming. The proposed framework produces coherent joint probabilistic forecasts for count hierarchical time series. Two discrete reconciliation algorithms are also proposed and compared against generalisations of the top-down and bottom-up approaches for count data. Two simulation experiments and two empirical examples are conducted to validate that the proposed reconciliation algorithms improve forecast accuracy. The empirical applications are forecasting criminal offences in Washington D.C. and product unit sales in the M5 dataset. Compared to benchmarks, the proposed framework shows superior performance in both simulations and empirical studies.</p></details> |  |

Faults or Anomalies are observed in these time-series data owing to faults observed with respect to metric name, resources region, dimensions, and its dimension value associated with the data. For Azure Core, an important task is to highlight faults or anomalies to the user on a dashboard that they can perceive easily. The number of anomalies reported should be highly significant and in a limited number, e.g., 5-20 anomalies reported per hour. The reported anomalies will have significant user perception and high reconstruction error in any time-series forecasting model. Hence, our task is to automatically identify 'high significant anomalies' and their associated information for user perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundational GPT Model for MEG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09256v1)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning techniques can be used to first training unsupervised models on large amounts of unlabelled data, before fine-tuning the models on specific tasks. This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation.

As a result, it becomes a challenge for large-scale Telecom software companies to develop and test software for all deployment scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for Automated Test Generation for large-scale Telecom Software systems. We begin by generating Test Case Input data for test scenarios observed using a time-series Generative model trained on historical Telecom Network data during field trials. Additionally, the time-series Generative model helps in preserving the privacy of Telecom data. The generated time-series software performance data are then utilized with test descriptions written in natural language to generate Test Script using the Generative Large Language Model. Our comprehensive experiments on public datasets and Telecom datasets obtained from operational Telecom Networks demonstrate that the framework can effectively generate comprehensive test case data input and useful test code.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at 1st Workshop on The Impact of Large Language Models on 6G Networks - IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2024</p></details> |

Telecom networks encompass numerous underlying and intertwined software and hardware components, each providing different functionalities. To ensure the stability of telecom networks, telecom software, and hardware vendors developed several methods to detect any aberrant behavior in telecom networks and enable instant feedback and alerts. These approaches, although powerful, struggle to generalize due to the unsteady nature of the software-intensive embedded system and the complexity and diversity of multi-standard mobile networks. In this paper, we present a system to detect anomalies in telecom networks using a generative AI model. We evaluate several strategies using diffusion models to train the model for anomaly detection using multivariate time-series data. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (i) A proposal of a framework for utilizing diffusion models for time-series anomaly detection in telecom networks, (ii) A proposal of a particular Diffusion model architecture that outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques, (iii) Experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate that our model effectively provides explainable results, exposing some of its limitations and suggesting future research avenues to enhance its capabilities further.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at Sixth International Workshop on Data Driven Intelligence for Networks and Systems (DDINS) - IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models as Virtual Annotators for Time-series Physical Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01133v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional human-in-the-loop-based annotation for time-series data like inertial data often requires access to alternate modalities like video or audio from the environment. These alternate sources provide the necessary information to the human annotator, as the raw numeric data is often too obfuscated even for an expert. However, this traditional approach has many concerns surrounding overall cost, efficiency, storage of additional modalities, time, scalability, and privacy. Interestingly, recent large language models (LLMs) are also trained with vast amounts of publicly available alphanumeric data, which allows them to comprehend and perform well on tasks beyond natural language processing. Naturally, this opens up a potential avenue to explore LLMs as virtual annotators where the LLMs will be directly provided the raw sensor data for annotation instead of relying on any alternate modality. Naturally, this could mitigate the problems of the traditional human-in-the-loop approach. Motivated by this observation, we perform a detailed study in this paper to assess whether the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs can be used as virtual annotators for labeling time-series physical sensing data. To perform this in a principled manner, we segregate the study into two major phases. In the first phase, we investigate the challenges an LLM like GPT-4 faces in comprehending raw sensor data. Considering the observations from phase 1, in the next phase, we investigate the possibility of encoding the raw sensor data using SOTA SSL approaches and utilizing the projected time-series data to get annotations from the LLM. Detailed evaluation with four benchmark HAR datasets shows that SSL-based encoding and metric-based guidance allow the LLM to make more reasonable decisions and provide accurate annotations without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning or sophisticated prompt engineering.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing RF-oriented generative solutions are ill-suited for generating high-quality, time-series RF data due to limited representation capabilities. In this work, inspired by the stellar achievements of the diffusion model in CV and NLP, we adapt it to the RF domain and propose RF-Diffusion. To accommodate the unique characteristics of RF signals, we first introduce a novel Time-Frequency Diffusion theory to enhance the original diffusion model, enabling it to tap into the information within the time, frequency, and complex-valued domains of RF signals. On this basis, we propose a Hierarchical Diffusion Transformer to translate the theory into a practical generative DNN through elaborated design spanning network architecture, functional block, and complex-valued operator, making RF-Diffusion a versatile solution to generate diverse, high-quality, and time-series RF data. Performance comparison with three prevalent generative models demonstrates the RF-Diffusion's superior performance in synthesizing Wi-Fi and FMCW signals. We also showcase the versatility of RF-Diffusion in boosting Wi-Fi sensing systems and performing channel estimation in 5G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MobiCom 2024</p></details> |
| **[When and How: Learning Identifiable Latent States for Nonstationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12767v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal distribution shifts are ubiquitous in time series data. One of the most popular methods assumes that the temporal distribution shift occurs uniformly to disentangle the stationary and nonstationary dependencies. But this assumption is difficult to meet, as we do not know when the distribution shifts occur. To solve this problem, we propose to learn IDentifiable latEnt stAtes (IDEA) to detect when the distribution shifts occur. Beyond that, we further disentangle the stationary and nonstationary latent states via sufficient observation assumption to learn how the latent states change. Specifically, we formalize the causal process with environment-irrelated stationary and environment-related nonstationary variables. Under mild conditions, we show that latent environments and stationary/nonstationary variables are identifiable. Based on these theories, we devise the IDEA model, which incorporates an autoregressive hidden Markov model to estimate latent environments and modular prior networks to identify latent states. The IDEA model outperforms several latest nonstationary forecasting methods on various benchmark datasets, highlighting its advantages in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Developing An Attention-Based Ensemble Learning Framework for Financial Portfolio Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08935v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep or reinforcement learning approaches have been applied to optimise investment portfolios through learning the spatial and temporal information under the dynamic financial market. Yet in most cases, the existing approaches may produce biased trading signals based on the conventional price data due to a lot of market noises, which possibly fails to balance the investment returns and risks. Accordingly, a multi-agent and self-adaptive portfolio optimisation framework integrated with attention mechanisms and time series, namely the MASAAT, is proposed in this work in which multiple trading agents are created to observe and analyse the price series and directional change data that recognises the significant changes of asset prices at different levels of granularity for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of price series. Afterwards, by reconstructing the tokens of financial data in a sequence, the attention-based cross-sectional analysis module and temporal analysis module of each agent can effectively capture the correlations between assets and the dependencies between time points. Besides, a portfolio generator is integrated into the proposed framework to fuse the spatial-temporal information and then summarise the portfolios suggested by all trading agents to produce a newly ensemble portfolio for reducing biased trading actions and balancing the overall returns and risks. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the MASAAT framework achieves impressive enhancement when compared with many well-known portfolio optimsation approaches on three challenging data sets of DJIA, S&P 500 and CSI 300. More importantly, our proposal has potential strengths in many possible applications for future study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Transformers are Better EEG Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11654v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained large transformer models have achieved remarkable performance in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. However, the limited availability of public electroencephalogram (EEG) data presents a unique challenge for extending the success of these models to EEG-based tasks. To address this gap, we propose AdaCT, plug-and-play Adapters designed for Converting Time series data into spatio-temporal 2D pseudo-images or text forms. Essentially, AdaCT-I transforms multi-channel or lengthy single-channel time series data into spatio-temporal 2D pseudo-images for fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers, while AdaCT-T converts short single-channel data into text for fine-tuning pre-trained language transformers. The proposed approach allows for seamless integration of pre-trained vision models and language models in time series decoding tasks, particularly in EEG data analysis. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets, including Epileptic Seizure Recognition, Sleep-EDF, and UCI HAR, demonstrate the superiority of AdaCT over baseline methods. Overall, we provide a promising transfer learning framework for leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained vision and language models in EEG-based tasks, thereby advancing the field of time series decoding and enhancing interpretability in EEG data analysis.

| **[Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learning from Leading Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548v5)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

Here, we develop a general model, with no real-world training data, that accurately forecasts outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We propose a novel framework, using a feature-based time series classification method to forecast outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We tested our methods on synthetic data from a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model for slowly changing, noisy disease dynamics. Outbreak sequences give a transcritical bifurcation within a specified future time window, whereas non-outbreak (null bifurcation) sequences do not. We identified incipient differences in time series of infectives leading to future outbreaks and non-outbreaks. These differences are reflected in 22 statistical features and 5 early warning signal indicators. Classifier performance, given by the area under the receiver-operating curve, ranged from 0.99 for large expanding windows of training data to 0.7 for small rolling windows. Real-world performances of classifiers were tested on two empirical datasets, COVID-19 data from Singapore and SARS data from Hong Kong, with two classifiers exhibiting high accuracy. In summary, we showed that there are statistical features that distinguish outbreak and non-outbreak sequences long before outbreaks occur. We could detect these differences in synthetic and real-world data sets, well before potential outbreaks occur.</p></details> |  |

This paper extends boosting's trend determination capability to higher order integrated processes and time series with roots that are local to unity. The theory is established by understanding the asymptotic effect of boosting on a simple exponential function. Given a universe of time series in FRED databases that exhibit various dynamic patterns, boosting timely captures downturns at crises and recoveries that follow.</p></details> |  |

Monitoring and analysis of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) plays a pivotal role in understanding air quality changes. This study focuses on the application of a new bandpass bootstrap approach, termed the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB), for analyzing time series data which provides modeled predictions of daily mean PM2.5 concentrations over 16 years in Manhattan, New York, the United States. The VBPBB can be used to explore periodically correlated (PC) principal components for this daily mean PM2.5 dataset. This method uses bandpass filters to isolate distinct PC components from datasets, removing unwanted interference including noise, and bootstraps the PC components. This preserves the PC structure and permits a better understanding of the periodic characteristics of time series data. The results of the VBPBB are compared against outcomes from alternative block bootstrapping techniques. The findings of this research indicate potential trends of elevated PM2.5 levels, providing evidence of significant semi-annual and weekly patterns missed by other methods.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based models excel at capturing long-range dependencies, they face limitations in noise sensitivity, computational efficiency, and overfitting with smaller datasets. In response, we introduce a novel Time Series Lightweight Adaptive Network (TSLANet), as a universal convolutional model for diverse time series tasks. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Spectral Block, harnessing Fourier analysis to enhance feature representation and to capture both long-term and short-term interactions while mitigating noise via adaptive thresholding. Additionally, we introduce an Interactive Convolution Block and leverage self-supervised learning to refine the capacity of TSLANet for decoding complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness on different datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TSLANet outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks spanning classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, showcasing its resilience and adaptability across a spectrum of noise levels and data sizes.

It has numerous applications; it forms, for example, part of the definition of transfer entropy, a common measure of the causal relationship between time series. It does, however, require a lot of data to estimate accurately and suffers the curse of dimensionality, limiting its application in machine learning and data science. However, the Kozachenko-Leonenko approach can address this problem: it is possible, in this approach to define a nearest-neighbour estimator which depends only on the distance between data points and not on the dimension of the data. Furthermore, the bias can be calculated analytically for this estimator. Here this estimator is described and is tested on simulated data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, current multimodal EO datasets and models focus on a single data type, either mono-date images or time series, which limits their expressivity. We introduce OmniSat, a novel architecture that exploits the spatial alignment between multiple EO modalities to learn expressive multimodal representations without labels. To demonstrate the advantages of combining modalities of different natures, we augment two existing datasets with new modalities. As demonstrated on three downstream tasks: forestry, land cover classification, and crop mapping.

These tools typically rely on evaluating a single time point, overlook the time ordering of inputs, and neglect the time-sensitive nature of time series applications. These factors make it difficult for users, particularly those without domain knowledge, to comprehend AI model decisions and obtain meaningful explanations. We propose CGS-Mask, a post-hoc and model-agnostic cellular genetic strip mask-based saliency approach to address these challenges. CGS-Mask uses consecutive time steps as a cohesive entity to evaluate the impact of features on the final prediction, providing binary and sustained feature importance scores over time. Our algorithm optimizes the mask population iteratively to obtain the optimal mask in a reasonable time. We evaluated CGS-Mask on synthetic and real-world datasets, and it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in elucidating the importance of features over time. According to our pilot user study via a questionnaire survey, CGS-Mask is the most effective approach in presenting easily understandable time series prediction results, enabling users to comprehend the decision-making process of AI models with ease.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI24 |
| **[Neural Likelihood Approximation for Integer Valued Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12544v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic processes defined on integer valued state spaces are popular within the physical and biological sciences. These models are necessary for capturing the dynamics of small systems where the individual nature of the populations cannot be ignored and stochastic effects are important. The inference of the parameters of such models, from time series data, is challenging due to intractability of the likelihood. To work at all, current simulation based inference methods require the generation of realisations of the model conditional on the data, which can be both tricky to implement and computationally expensive. In this paper we instead construct a neural likelihood approximation that can be trained using unconditional simulation of the underlying model, which is much simpler. We demonstrate our method by performing inference on a number of ecological and epidemiological models, showing that we can accurately approximate the true posterior while achieving significant computational speed ups compared to current best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224v1)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, under review by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |

We transform time-series load profiles into load images. This allows us to leverage the ViT architecture, originally designed for image processing, as a pre-trained image encoder to uncover latent patterns within load data. ViT is pre-trained using an extensive load image dataset, comprising 1M load images derived from smart meter data collected over a two-year period from 2,000 residential users. The training methodology is self-supervised, masked image modeling, wherein masked load images are restored to reveal hidden relationships among image patches. The pre-trained ViT encoder is then applied to various downstream tasks, including the identification of electric vehicle (EV) charging loads and behind-the-meter solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and load disaggregation. Simulation results illustrate ViT4LPA's superior performance compared to existing neural network models in downstream tasks. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the attention weights within the ViT4LPA model to gain insights into its information flow mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exponentially Weighted Moving Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08136v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An exponentially weighted moving model (EWMM) for a vector time series fits a new data model each time period, based on an exponentially fading loss function on past observed data. The well known and widely used exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is a special case that estimates the mean using a square loss function. For quadratic loss functions EWMMs can be fit using a simple recursion that updates the parameters of a quadratic function. For other loss functions, the entire past history must be stored, and the fitting problem grows in size as time increases. We propose a general method for computing an approximation of EWMM, which requires storing only a window of a fixed number of past samples, and uses an additional quadratic term to approximate the loss associated with the data before the window. This approximate EWMM relies on convex optimization, and solves problems that do not grow with time. We compare the estimates produced by our approximation with the estimates from the exact EWMM method.</p></details> |  |

Predominantly, Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely employed in this domain.

In this study, we extend the application of CNN-LSTMs to time series settings, leveraging lagged streamflow data in conjunction with precipitation and temperature data to predict streamflow. Our results show a substantial improvement in predictive performance in 21 out of 32 HUC8 basins in Nebraska, showcasing noteworthy increases in the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values. These results highlight the effectiveness of CNN-LSTMs in time series settings, particularly for spatiotemporal hydrological modeling, for more accurate and robust streamflow predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly Detection in Power Grids via Context-Agnostic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07898v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important tool grid operators use to safeguard against failures, whether naturally occurring or malicious, involves detecting anomalies in the power system SCADA data. In this paper, we aim to solve a real-time anomaly detection problem. Given time-series measurement values coming from a fixed set of sensors on the grid, can we identify anomalies in the network topology or measurement data? Existing methods, primarily optimization-based, mostly use only a single snapshot of the measurement values and do not scale well with the network size. Recent data-driven ML techniques have shown promise by using a combination of current and historical data for anomaly detection but generally do not consider physical attributes like the impact of topology or load/generation changes on sensor measurements and thus cannot accommodate regular context-variability in the historical data. To address this gap, we propose a novel context-aware anomaly detection algorithm, GridCAL, that considers the effect of regular topology and load/generation changes. This algorithm converts the real-time power flow measurements to context-agnostic values, which allows us to analyze measurement coming from different grid contexts in an aggregate fashion, enabling us to derive a unified statistical model that becomes the basis of anomaly detection. Through numerical simulations on networks up to 2383 nodes, we show that our approach is accurate, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, and is computationally efficient.</p></details> |  |

Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises the physical openness, posing challenges for neuromorphic realizations. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with large-scale computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delay inputs. We show that, much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and high-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, fewer hyperparameters and increased interpretability compared to conventional optical RC, while achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Given its scalability and versatility, the optical NGRC framework also paves the way for next generation physical RC, new applications and architectures in a broad sense.</p></details> |  |

Long term missions, such as NASA's Landsat, Terra, and Aqua satellites, and more recently, the ESA's Sentinel missions, record images of the entire world every few days. Although single images provide point-in-time data, repeated images of the same area, or satellite image time series (SITS) provide information about the changing state of vegetation and land use. These SITS are useful for modeling dynamic processes and seasonal changes such as plant phenology. They have potential benefits for many aspects of land and natural resource management, including applications in agricultural, forest, water, and disaster management, urban planning, and mining. However, the resulting satellite image time series (SITS) are complex, incorporating information from the temporal, spatial, and spectral dimensions. Therefore, deep learning methods are often deployed as they can analyze these complex relationships. This review presents a summary of the state-of-the-art methods of modelling environmental, agricultural, and other Earth observation variables from SITS data using deep learning methods. We aim to provide a resource for remote sensing experts interested in using deep learning techniques to enhance Earth observation models with temporal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, the effectiveness of such technologies depends upon the availability of large, high-quality datasets that are suitable for machine learning. This paper introduces the Oxford Maternity (OxMat) dataset, the world's largest curated dataset of CTGs, featuring raw time series CTG data and extensive clinical data for both mothers and babies, which is ideally placed for machine learning. The OxMat dataset addresses the critical gap in women's health data by providing over 177,211 unique CTG recordings from 51,036 pregnancies, carefully curated and reviewed since 1991. The dataset also comprises over 200 antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum clinical variables, ensuring near-complete data for crucial outcomes such as stillbirth and acidaemia. While this dataset also covers the intrapartum stage, around 94% of the constituent CTGS are antepartum. This allows for a unique focus on the underserved antepartum period, in which early detection of at-risk fetuses can significantly improve health outcomes. Our comprehensive review of existing datasets reveals the limitations of current datasets: primarily, their lack of sufficient volume, detailed clinical data and antepartum data. The OxMat dataset lays a foundation for future AI-driven prenatal care, offering a robust resource for developing and testing algorithms aimed at improving maternal and fetal health outcomes.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a state-space model for time-varying functions to extract trends and serial dependence from functional time series while imposing the shape constraints on the estimated functions. The function of interest is modeled by a convex combination of selected basis functions to satisfy the shape constraints, where the time-varying convex weights on simplex follow the dynamic multi-logit models. For the complicated likelihood of this model, a novel data augmentation technique is devised to enable posterior computation by an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of time-varying Lorenz curves, and its utility is illustrated through numerical experiments and analysis of panel data of household incomes in Japan.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue proactively, people should be aware of their surroundings, which means the environment where they survive. With this motive, this research has predicted the AQI based on different air pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere. The dataset used for this research has been taken from the official website of CPCB. The dataset has the air pollutant concentration from 22 different monitoring stations in different cities of Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab. This data is checked for null values and outliers. But, the most important thing to note is the correct understanding and imputation of such values rather than ignoring or doing wrong imputation. The time series data has been used in this research which is tested for stationarity using The Dickey-Fuller test. Further different ML models like CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM regressor, time series model SARIMAX, and deep learning model LSTM have been used to predict AQI. For the performance evaluation of different models, I used MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2. It is observed that Random Forest performed better as compared to other models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RiskLabs: Predicting Financial Risk Using Large Language Model Based on Multi-Sources Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07452v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering (Q$\&$A), and stock movement prediction (binary classification), with a notable gap in the application of LLMs for financial risk prediction. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce \textbf{RiskLabs}, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely combines different types of financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data surrounding ECC release dates. Our approach involves a multi-stage process: initially extracting and analyzing ECC data using LLMs, followed by gathering and processing time-series data before the ECC dates to model and understand risk over different timeframes. Using multimodal fusion techniques, RiskLabs amalgamates these varied data features for comprehensive multi-task financial risk prediction. Empirical experiment results demonstrate RiskLab's effectiveness in forecasting both volatility and variance in financial markets. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate how different data sources contribute to financial risk assessment and discuss the critical role of LLMs in this context. Our findings not only contribute to the AI in finance application but also open new avenues for applying LLMs in financial risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

It is useful for modeling and predicting non-stationary time series and is widely applied in natural and social sciences. Existing segmentation methods primarily focus on only one type of parameter changes such as mean and variance, and they typically depend on laborious tuning or smoothing parameters, which can be challenging to choose in practice. The self-normalization based change-point estimation framework SNCP by Zhao et al. (2022), however, offers users more flexibility and convenience as it allows for change-point estimation of different types of parameters (e.g. mean, variance, quantile and autocovariance) in a unified fashion, and requires effortless tuning. In this paper, the R package SNSeg is introduced to implement SNCP for segmentation of univariate and multivariate time series. An extension of SNCP, named SNHD, is also designed and implemented for change-point estimation in the mean vector of high-dimensional time series. The estimated changepoints as well as segmented time series are available with graphical tools. Detailed examples of SNSeg are given in simulations of multivariate autoregressive processes with change-points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minusformer: Improving Time Series Forecasting by Progressively Learning Residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02332v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we find that ubiquitous time series (TS) forecasting models are prone to severe overfitting. To cope with this problem, we embrace a de-redundancy approach to progressively reinstate the intrinsic values of TS for future intervals. Specifically, we renovate the vanilla Transformer by reorienting the information aggregation mechanism from addition to subtraction. Then, we incorporate an auxiliary output branch into each block of the original model to construct a highway leading to the ultimate prediction. The output of subsequent modules in this branch will subtract the previously learned results, enabling the model to learn the residuals of the supervision signal, layer by layer. This designing facilitates the learning-driven implicit progressive decomposition of the input and output streams, empowering the model with heightened versatility, interpretability, and resilience against overfitting. Since all aggregations in the model are minus signs, which is called Minusformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding an average performance improvement of 11.9% across various datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debiasing Welch's Method for Spectral Density Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13643v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Welch's method provides an estimator of the power spectral density that is statistically consistent. This is achieved by averaging over periodograms calculated from overlapping segments of a time series. For a finite length time series, while the variance of the estimator decreases as the number of segments increase, the magnitude of the estimator's bias increases: a bias-variance trade-off ensues when setting the segment number. We address this issue by providing a novel method for debiasing Welch's method which maintains the computational complexity and asymptotic consistency, and leads to improved finite-sample performance. Theoretical results are given for fourth-order stationary processes with finite fourth-order moments and absolutely convergent fourth-order cumulant function. The significant bias reduction is demonstrated with numerical simulation and an application to real-world data. Our estimator also permits irregular spacing over frequency and we demonstrate how this may be employed for signal compression and further variance reduction. Code accompanying this work is available in R and python.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resub...</summary><p>Resubmitted to Biometrika</p></details> |
| **[Deep Generative Sampling in the Dual Divergence Space: A Data-efficient & Interpretative Approach for Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07377v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the remarkable achievements in generative sampling of natural images, we propose an innovative challenge, potentially overly ambitious, which involves generating samples of entire multivariate time series that resemble images. However, the statistical challenge lies in the small sample size, sometimes consisting of a few hundred subjects. This issue is especially problematic for deep generative models that follow the conventional approach of generating samples from a canonical distribution and then decoding or denoising them to match the true data distribution. In contrast, our method is grounded in information theory and aims to implicitly characterize the distribution of images, particularly the (global and local) dependency structure between pixels. We achieve this by empirically estimating its KL-divergence in the dual form with respect to the respective marginal distribution. This enables us to perform generative sampling directly in the optimized 1-D dual divergence space. Specifically, in the dual space, training samples representing the data distribution are embedded in the form of various clusters between two end points. In theory, any sample embedded between those two end points is in-distribution w.r.t. the data distribution. Our key idea for generating novel samples of images is to interpolate between the clusters via a walk as per gradients of the dual function w.r.t. the data dimensions. In addition to the data efficiency gained from direct sampling, we propose an algorithm that offers a significant reduction in sample complexity for estimating the divergence of the data distribution with respect to the marginal distribution. We provide strong theoretical guarantees along with an extensive empirical evaluation using many real-world datasets from diverse domains, establishing the superiority of our approach w.r.t. state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-ergodicity in reinforcement learning: robustness via ergodicity transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11335v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Envisioned application areas for reinforcement learning (RL) include autonomous driving, precision agriculture, and finance, which all require RL agents to make decisions in the real world. A significant challenge hindering the adoption of RL methods in these domains is the non-robustness of conventional algorithms. In this paper, we argue that a fundamental issue contributing to this lack of robustness lies in the focus on the expected value of the return as the sole ``correct'' optimization objective. The expected value is the average over the statistical ensemble of infinitely many trajectories. For non-ergodic returns, this average differs from the average over a single but infinitely long trajectory. Consequently, optimizing the expected value can lead to policies that yield exceptionally high returns with probability zero but almost surely result in catastrophic outcomes. This problem can be circumvented by transforming the time series of collected returns into one with ergodic increments. This transformation enables learning robust policies by optimizing the long-term return for individual agents rather than the average across infinitely many trajectories. We propose an algorithm for learning ergodicity transformations from data and demonstrate its effectiveness in an instructive, non-ergodic environment and on standard RL benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In our approach, random matrices are used to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, systems as simple as a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain are used to perform several tasks, including time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique as well as their current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the spin chain, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices as measurements of simple quantum systems for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realisation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

We study the special case where each of the L covariance matrices is modeled as a rank K perturbation of the identity matrix, corresponding to a signal plus noise model. A new test statistic based on the estimates of the eigenvalues of the different covariance matrices is proposed. In particular, we show that this statistic is consistent and with controlled type I error in the high-dimensional asymptotic regime where the sample sizes $N_1,\ldots,N_L$ of each time series and the dimension $M$ both converge to infinity at the same rate, while $K$ and $L$ are kept fixed. We also provide some simulations on synthetic and real data (SAR images) which demonstrate significant improvements over some classical methods such as the GLRT, or other alternative methods relevant for the high-dimensional regime and the low-rank model.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, preprint of the version that will appear in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in RL, which focuses on identifying situations at test time that RL agents have not encountered in their training environments. We first propose a clarification of terminology for OOD detection in RL, which aligns it with the literature from other machine learning domains. We then present new benchmark scenarios for OOD detection, which introduce anomalies with temporal autocorrelation into different components of the agent-environment loop. We argue that such scenarios have been understudied in the current literature, despite their relevance to real-world situations. Confirming our theoretical predictions, our experimental results suggest that state-of-the-art OOD detectors are not able to identify such anomalies. To address this problem, we propose a novel method for OOD detection, which we call DEXTER (Detection via Extraction of Time Series Representations). By treating environment observations as time series data, DEXTER extracts salient time series features, and then leverages an ensemble of isolation forest algorithms to detect anomalies. We find that DEXTER can reliably identify anomalies across benchmark scenarios, exhibiting superior performance compared to both state-of-the-art OOD detectors and high-dimensional changepoint detectors adopted from statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper to the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Least Squares-Based Permutation Tests in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06238v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies permutation tests for regression parameters in a time series setting, where the time series is assumed stationary but may exhibit an arbitrary (but weak) dependence structure. In such a setting, it is perhaps surprising that permutation tests can offer any type of inference guarantees, since permuting of covariates can destroy its relationship with the response. Indeed, the fundamental assumption of exchangeability of errors required for the finite-sample exactness of permutation tests, can easily fail. However, we show that permutation tests may be constructed which are asymptotically valid for a wide class of stationary processes, but remain exact when exchangeability holds. We also consider the problem of testing for no monotone trend and we construct asymptotically valid permutation tests in this setting as well.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Permutation Testing for Monotone Trend](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06239v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the fundamental problem of testing for monotone trend in a time series. While the term "trend" is commonly used and has an intuitive meaning, it is first crucial to specify its exact meaning in a hypothesis testing context. A commonly used well-known test is the Mann-Kendall test, which we show does not offer Type 1 error control even in large samples. On the other hand, by an appropriate studentization of the Mann-Kendall statistic, we construct permutation tests that offer asymptotic error control quite generally, but retain the exactness property of permutation tests for i.i.d. observations. We also introduce "local" Mann-Kendall statistics as a means of testing for local rather than global trend in a time series. Similar properties of permutation tests are obtained for these tests as well.</p></details> | 32 pages |

EEG Classification with Time Series Models and Joint Subject Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06966v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As with most other data domains, EEG data analysis relies on rich domain-specific preprocessing. Beyond such preprocessing, machine learners would hope to deal with such data as with any other time series data. For EEG classification many models have been developed with layer types and architectures we typically do not see in time series classification. Furthermore, typically separate models for each individual subject are learned, not one model for all of them. In this paper, we systematically study the differences between EEG classification models and generic time series classification models. We describe three different model setups to deal with EEG data from different subjects, subject-specific models (most EEG literature), subject-agnostic models and subject-conditional models. In experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that off-the-shelf time series classification models trained per subject perform close to EEG classification models, but that do not quite reach the performance of domain-specific modeling. Additionally, we combine time-series models with subject embeddings to train one joint subject-conditional classifier on all subjects. The resulting models are competitive with dedicated EEG models in 2 out of 3 datasets, even outperforming all EEG methods on one of them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Real-time Pandemic Forecasting Using Large Language Models: A COVID-19 Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06962v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the short-term spread of an ongoing disease outbreak is a formidable challenge due to the complexity of contributing factors, some of which can be characterized through interlinked, multi-modality variables such as epidemiological time series data, viral biology, population demographics, and the intersection of public policy and human behavior. Existing forecasting model frameworks struggle with the multifaceted nature of relevant data and robust results translation, which hinders their performances and the provision of actionable insights for public health decision-makers. Our work introduces PandemicLLM, a novel framework with multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) that reformulates real-time forecasting of disease spread as a text reasoning problem, with the ability to incorporate real-time, complex, non-numerical information that previously unattainable in traditional forecasting models. This approach, through a unique AI-human cooperative prompt design and time series representation learning, encodes multi-modal data for LLMs. The model is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, and trained to utilize textual public health policies, genomic surveillance, spatial, and epidemiological time series data, and is subsequently tested across all 50 states of the U.S. Empirically, PandemicLLM is shown to be a high-performing pandemic forecasting framework that effectively captures the impact of emerging variants and can provide timely and accurate predictions. The proposed PandemicLLM opens avenues for incorporating various pandemic-related data in heterogeneous formats and exhibits performance benefits over existing models. This study illuminates the potential of adapting LLMs and representation learning to enhance pandemic forecasting, illustrating how AI innovations can strengthen pandemic responses and crisis management in the future.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |

Grounding LLMs in the physical world remains an open challenge as they can only process textual input. Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the physical world by incorporating visual input, which provides richer contextual information than language alone. In this work, we proposed a novel paradigm that leveraged GPT-4V(ision), the state-of-the-art LVLM by OpenAI, to enable embodied agents to perceive liquid objects via image-based environmental feedback. Specifically, we exploited the physical understanding of GPT-4V to interpret the visual representation (e.g., time-series plot) of non-visual feedback (e.g., F/T sensor data), indirectly enabling multimodal perception beyond vision and language using images as proxies. We evaluated our method using 10 common household liquids with containers of various geometry and material. Without any training or fine-tuning, we demonstrated that our method can enable the robot to indirectly perceive the physical response of liquids and estimate their viscosity. We also showed that by jointly reasoning over the visual and physical attributes learned through interactions, our method could recognize liquid objects in the absence of strong visual cues (e.g., container labels with legible text or symbols), increasing the accuracy from 69.0% -- achieved by the best-performing vision-only variant -- to 86.0%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

Traditionally, this analysis is conducted in clinical settings and involves a time-consuming scoring procedure. Recent data-driven algorithms for sleep staging, using the photoplethysmogram (PPG) time series, have shown high performance on local test sets but lower performance on external datasets due to data drift. Methods: This study aimed to develop a generalizable deep learning model for the task of four class (wake, light, deep, and rapid eye movement (REM)) sleep staging from raw PPG physiological time-series. Six sleep datasets, totaling 2,574 patients recordings, were used. In order to create a more generalizable representation, we developed and evaluated a deep learning model called SleepPPG-Net2, which employs a multi-source domain training approach.SleepPPG-Net2 was benchmarked against two state-of-the-art models. Results: SleepPPG-Net2 showed consistently higher performance over benchmark approaches, with generalization performance (Cohen's kappa) improving by up to 19%. Performance disparities were observed in relation to age, sex, and sleep apnea severity. Conclusion: SleepPPG-Net2 sets a new standard for staging sleep from raw PPG time-series.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, how to effectively leverage multiple modalities from EHRs poses significant challenges, given its complex characteristics such as high dimensionality, multimodality, sparsity, varied recording frequencies, and temporal irregularities. To this end, this paper introduces a novel multimodal contrastive learning framework, specifically focusing on medical time series and clinical notes. To tackle the challenge of sparsity and irregular time intervals in medical time series, the framework integrates temporal cross-attention transformers with a dynamic embedding and tokenization scheme for learning multimodal feature representations. To harness the interconnected relationships between medical time series and clinical notes, the framework equips a global contrastive loss, aligning a patient's multimodal feature representations with the corresponding discharge summaries. Since discharge summaries uniquely pertain to individual patients and represent a holistic view of the patient's hospital stay, machine learning models are led to learn discriminative multimodal features via global contrasting. Extensive experiments with a real-world EHR dataset demonstrated that our framework outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on the exemplar task of predicting the occurrence of nine postoperative complications for more than 120,000 major inpatient surgeries using multimodal data from UF health system split among three hospitals (UF Health Gainesville, UF Health Jacksonville, and UF Health Jacksonville-North).</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.04012</p></details> |

This reduces costs for the bank, as the list aggregates the bank's internal firm inventory per asset for all clients of long as well as short trades. However, this is somewhat problematic: (1) the bank's inventory is revealed; (2) trades of clients who contribute to the aggregated list, particularly those deemed large, are revealed to other clients. Clients conducting sizable trades with the bank and possessing a portion of the aggregated asset exceeding $50\%$ are considered to be concentrated clients. This could potentially reveal a trading concentrated client's activity to their competitors, thus providing an unfair advantage over the market. Atlas-X Axe Obfuscation, powered by new differential private methods, enables a bank to obfuscate its published axe list on a daily basis while under continual observation, thus maintaining an acceptable inventory Profit and Loss (P&L) cost pertaining to the noisy obfuscated axe list while reducing the clients' trading activity leakage. Our main differential private innovation is a differential private aggregator for streams (time series data) of both positive and negative integers under continual observation. For the last two years, Atlas-X system has been live in production across three major regions-USA, Europe, and Asia-at J.P. Morgan, a major financial institution, facilitating significant profitability. To our knowledge, it is the first differential privacy solution to be deployed in the financial sector. We also report benchmarks of our algorithm based on (anonymous) real and synthetic data to showcase the quality of our obfuscation and its success in production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Representation Learning from Multiple Distributions: A General Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05052v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical functions of the hidden causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects). For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the hidden causal variables $Z_i$ and their causal relations represented by graph $\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series), without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases, each latent variable can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations. Experimental results verify our theoretical claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Feature Search Method for Multichannel EEG: Application in ADHD classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06676v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the preliminary diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using electroencephalography (EEG) has garnered attention from researchers. EEG, known for its expediency and efficiency, plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. However, the non-stationarity of EEG signals and inter-subject variability pose challenges to the diagnostic and classification processes. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a novel perspective for ADHD classification, diverging from traditional time-frequency domain features. Yet, conventional TDA models are restricted to single-channel time series and are susceptible to noise, leading to the loss of topological features in persistence diagrams.This paper presents an enhanced TDA approach applicable to multi-channel EEG in ADHD. Initially, optimal input parameters for multi-channel EEG are determined. Subsequently, each channel's EEG undergoes phase space reconstruction (PSR) followed by the utilization of k-Power Distance to Measure (k-PDTM) for approximating ideal point clouds. Then, multi-dimensional time series are re-embedded, and TDA is applied to obtain topological feature information. Gaussian function-based Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation (MKDE) is employed in the merger persistence diagram to filter out desired topological feature mappings. Finally, persistence image (PI) method is utilized to extract topological features, and the influence of various weighting functions on the results is discussed.The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using the IEEE ADHD dataset. Results demonstrate that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach 85.60%, 83.61%, and 88.33%, respectively. Compared to traditional TDA methods, our method was effectively improved and outperforms typical nonlinear descriptors. These findings indicate that our method exhibits higher precision and robustness.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |

However, existing automated methods do not perform very well for early rumor detection, which is crucial in many settings, e.g., in crisis situations. One reason for this is that aggregated rumor features such as propagation features, which work well on the long run, are - due to their accumulating characteristic - not very helpful in the early phase of a rumor. In this work, we present an approach for early rumor detection, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks for learning the hidden representations of individual rumor-related tweets to gain insights on the credibility of each tweets. We then aggregate the predictions from the very beginning of a rumor to obtain the overall event credits (so-called wisdom), and finally combine it with a time series based rumor classification model. Our extensive experiments show a clearly improved classification performance within the critical very first hours of a rumor. For a better understanding, we also conduct an extensive feature evaluation that emphasized on the early stage and shows that the low-level credibility has best predictability at all phases of the rumor lifetime.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 9...</summary><p>The 9th International Conference on Social Informatics</p></details> |

The resulting test has asymptotic power against local alternatives in $1/T$ neighbourhoods, unlike post-selection inference methods based on consistent model selection. Exploiting the information enrichment principle devised by Reinschl\"ussel and Arnold arXiv:2402.16580 [stat.ME] to improve the Lasso-based selection of ADF models, we propose a composite statistic and analyse its asymptotic distribution and local power function. Monte Carlo evidence shows that the combined test dominates the comparable post-selection inference methods of Tibshirani et al. [JASA, 2016, 514, 600-620] and may surpass the power of established unit root tests against local alternatives. We apply the new tests to groundwater level time series for Germany and find evidence rejecting stochastic trends to explain observed long-term declines in mean water levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 pa...</summary><p>59 pages, 9 figures (colour)</p></details> |

While benchmarks validate the performance of model generalization on various target data sets, there is no structured research providing similarity and diversity measures explaining which characteristics of source and target data lead to transfer learning success. Our study pioneers in systematically evaluating the impact of source-target similarity and source diversity on zero-shot and fine-tuned forecasting outcomes in terms of accuracy, bias, and uncertainty estimation. We investigate these dynamics using pre-trained neural networks across five public source datasets, applied in forecasting five target data sets, including real-world wholesales data. We identify two feature-based similarity and diversity measures showing: Source-target similarity enhances forecasting accuracy and reduces bias, while source diversity enhances forecasting accuracy and uncertainty estimation and increases the bias.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting.</p></details> | 33 pages, 9 figures |

However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible, user-oriented tools. In light of these challenges, this study embarks on an exhaustive dissection of DA methodologies within the TSC realm. Our initial approach involved an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing that contemporary surveys scarcely capture the breadth of advancements in DA for TSC, prompting us to meticulously analyze over 100 scholarly articles to distill more than 60 unique DA techniques. This rigorous analysis precipitated the formulation of a novel taxonomy, purpose-built for the intricacies of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five principal echelons: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. Our taxonomy promises to serve as a robust navigational aid for scholars, offering clarity and direction in method selection. Addressing the conspicuous absence of holistic evaluations for prevalent DA techniques, we executed an all-encompassing empirical assessment, wherein upwards of 15 DA strategies were subjected to scrutiny across 8 UCR time-series datasets, employing ResNet and a multi-faceted evaluation paradigm encompassing Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, yielding a benchmark accuracy of 88.94 +- 11.83%. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, with....</p></details> |  |

Consequently, there has been a recent surge in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with token adaptations for TS forecasting. These approaches employ cross-domain transfer learning and surprisingly yield impressive results. However, these models are typically very slow and large (~billion parameters) and do not consider cross-channel correlations. To address this, we present Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a significantly small model based on the lightweight TSMixer architecture. TTM marks the first success in developing fast and tiny general pre-trained models (<1M parameters), exclusively trained on public TS datasets, with effective transfer learning capabilities for forecasting. To tackle the complexity of pre-training on multiple datasets with varied temporal resolutions, we introduce several novel enhancements such as adaptive patching, dataset augmentation via downsampling, and resolution prefix tuning. Moreover, we employ a multi-level modeling strategy to effectively model channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning, a crucial capability lacking in existing benchmarks. TTM shows significant accuracy gains (12-38\%) over popular benchmarks in few/zero-shot forecasting. It also drastically reduces the compute needs as compared to LLM-TS methods, with a 14X cut in learnable parameters, 106X less total parameters, and substantial reductions in fine-tuning (65X) and inference time (54X). In fact, TTM's zero-shot often surpasses the few-shot results in many popular benchmarks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.

| **[Constructing hierarchical time series through clustering: Is there an optimal way for forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06064v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecast reconciliation has attracted significant research interest in recent years, with most studies taking the hierarchy of time series as given. We extend existing work that uses time series clustering to construct hierarchies, with the goal of improving forecast accuracy, in three ways. First, we investigate multiple approaches to clustering, including not only different clustering algorithms, but also the way time series are represented and how distance between time series is defined. We find that cluster-based hierarchies lead to improvements in forecast accuracy relative to two-level hierarchies. Second, we devise an approach based on random permutation of hierarchies, keeping the structure of the hierarchy fixed, while time series are randomly allocated to clusters. In doing so, we find that improvements in forecast accuracy that accrue from using clustering do not arise from grouping together similar series but from the structure of the hierarchy. Third, we propose an approach based on averaging forecasts across hierarchies constructed using different clustering methods, that is shown to outperform any single clustering method. All analysis is carried out on two benchmark datasets and a simulated dataset. Our findings provide new insights into the role of hierarchy construction in forecast reconciliation and offer valuable guidance on forecasting practice.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A feature-based information-theoretic approach for detecting interpretable, long-timescale pairwise interactions from time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05929v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying relationships between components of a complex system is critical to understanding the rich network of interactions that characterize the behavior of the system. Traditional methods for detecting pairwise dependence of time series, such as Pearson correlation, Granger causality, and mutual information, are computed directly in the space of measured time-series values. But for systems in which interactions are mediated by statistical properties of the time series (`time-series features') over longer timescales, this approach can fail to capture the underlying dependence from limited and noisy time-series data, and can be challenging to interpret. Addressing these issues, here we introduce an information-theoretic method for detecting dependence between time series mediated by time-series features that provides interpretable insights into the nature of the interactions. Our method extracts a candidate set of time-series features from sliding windows of the source time series and assesses their role in mediating a relationship to values of the target process. Across simulations of three different generative processes, we demonstrate that our feature-based approach can outperform a traditional inference approach based on raw time-series values, especially in challenging scenarios characterized by short time-series lengths, high noise levels, and long interaction timescales. Our work introduces a new tool for inferring and interpreting feature-mediated interactions from time-series data, contributing to the broader landscape of quantitative analysis in complex systems research, with potential applications in various domains including but not limited to neuroscience, finance, climate science, and engineering.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |

The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI); 26 pages, 200+ references; the first work to comprehensively and systematically summarize self-supervised learning for time series analysis (SSL4TS).

Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

Despite the recent advances in data-driven approaches, grasping remains an unsolved problem. Most of the works on this task are relying on priors and heavy constraints to avoid the exploration problem. Novelty Search (NS) refers to evolutionary algorithms that replace selection of best performing individuals with selection of the most novel ones. Such methods have already shown promising results on hard exploration problems. In this work, we introduce a new NS-based method that can generate large datasets of grasping trajectories in a platform-agnostic manner. Inspired by the hierarchical learning paradigm, our method decouples approach and prehension to make the behavioral space smoother. Experiments conducted on 3 different robot-gripper setups and on several standard objects shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art for generating diverse repertoire of grasping trajectories, getting a higher successful run ratio, as well as a better diversity for both approach and prehension. Some of the generated solutions have been successfully deployed on a real robot, showing the exploitability of the obtained repertoires.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, accepted by CVPRW</p></details> |

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-transmotion.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

Through comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and experiments, we compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight a remarkable improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a 115x faster computation speed than existing methods. This efficiency, combined with the possibility to tune the trajectories spacing to match the deposition process constraints, makes the potential integration of our approach into existing 3D printing processes seamless. Additionally, the open-hole tensile specimen produced on a conventional fused filament fabrication set-up with our algorithm achieve a notable ~10% improvement in specific modulus compared to existing trajectory optimization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed designs outperform various benchmark schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC) Spring, 2024</p></details> |

In practice, this is achieved by subgrouping, whereby clusters with similar patient characteristics are identified and then receive customized treatment plans with the goal of targeting subgroup-specific disease dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel mixture hidden Markov model for subgrouping patient trajectories from chronic diseases. Our model is probabilistic and carefully designed to capture different trajectory phases of chronic diseases (i.e., "severe", "moderate", and "mild") through tailored latent states. We demonstrate our subgrouping framework based on a longitudinal study across 847 patients with non-specific low back pain. Here, our subgrouping framework identifies 8 subgroups. Further, we show that our subgrouping framework outperforms common baselines in terms of cluster validity indices. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the model to other chronic and long-lasting diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming at Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Offline Trajectory Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories. Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts. However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation. Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6-D Trajectories for Omnidirectional Multirotor Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10392v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As fully-actuated systems, omnidirectional multirotor aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have more flexible maneuverability and advantages in aggressive flight in cluttered environments than traditional underactuated MAVs. %Due to the high dimensionality of configuration space, making the designed trajectory generation algorithm efficient is challenging. This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers.

| **[A Generic Trajectory Planning Method for Constrained All-Wheel-Steering Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09677v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a trajectory planning method for wheeled robots with fixed steering axes while the steering angle of each wheel is constrained. In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-aware Trajectory Optimization for UAV-mounted RIS and Full-duplex Relay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12107v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as transformative tools for dynamic and adaptive connectivity. However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

However, we observed that LCM struggles to generate images with both clarity and detailed intricacy. Consequently, we introduce Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD), which encompasses trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling. The trajectory consistency function diminishes the parameterisation and distillation errors by broadening the scope of the self-consistency boundary condition with trajectory mapping and endowing the TCD with the ability to accurately trace the entire trajectory of the Probability Flow ODE in semi-linear form with an Exponential Integrator. Additionally, strategic stochastic sampling provides explicit control of stochastic and circumvents the accumulated errors inherent in multi-step consistency sampling. Experiments demonstrate that TCD not only significantly enhances image quality at low NFEs but also yields more detailed results compared to the teacher model at high NFEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mhh0318.github.io/tcd</p></details> |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[WildGraph: Realistic Graph-based Trajectory Generation for Wildlife](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08068v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation is an important task in movement studies; it circumvents the privacy, ethical, and technical challenges of collecting real trajectories from the target population. In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics. Our code is published on the following repository: \url{https://github.com/aliwister/wildgraph}.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Performance of Jerk-Constrained Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Industrial Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07889v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jerk-constrained trajectories offer a wide range of advantages that collectively improve the performance of robotic systems, including increased energy efficiency, durability, and safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

| **[VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06351v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

| **[Diffusion-based inpainting of incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of trajectories generated by a fractional Brownian motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07029v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Brownian trajectories (fBm) feature both randomness and strong scale-free correlations, challenging generative models to reproduce the intrinsic memory characterizing the underlying process. Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

| **[Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proves challenging in tasks featuring scant rewards. These limited rewards merely signify whether the task is partially or entirely accomplished, necessitating various exploration actions before the agent garners meaningful feedback. Consequently, the majority of existing DRL exploration algorithms struggle to acquire practical policies within a reasonable timeframe. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach leveraging offline demonstration trajectories for swifter and more efficient online RL in environments with sparse rewards. Our pivotal insight involves treating offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, rather than mere imitation, allowing our method to learn a policy whose distribution of state-action visitation marginally matches that of offline demonstrations. We specifically introduce a novel trajectory distance relying on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and cast policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. We then illustrate that this optimization problem can be streamlined into a policy-gradient algorithm, integrating rewards shaped by insights from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm undergoes evaluation across extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and misleading rewards. The experimental findings demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed algorithm over baseline methods concerning diverse exploration and the acquisition of an optimal policy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction with Region-based Relation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06971v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRANP: A Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08004v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a vital component in autonomous driving, accurate trajectory prediction effectively prevents traffic accidents and improves driving efficiency. To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deadlock Resolution and Recursive Feasibility in MPC-based Multi-robot Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06071v4)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online collision-free trajectory generation within a shared workspace is fundamental for most multi-robot applications. However, many widely-used methods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on the feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a distributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where several robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as introducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to validate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method called infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The MPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered Voronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of deadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force equilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively detect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an adaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable deadlocks can exist under minor conditions. In addition, the proposed planning algorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each time step under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots and requires only local communication. Comprehensive simulation and experiment studies are conducted over large-scale multi-robot systems. Significant improvements on success rate are reported, in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and especially in crowded and high-speed scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Typically, this issue is addressed by providing low-level per-frame guidance in the form of edge maps, depth maps, or an existing video to be altered. However, the process of obtaining such guidance can be labor-intensive. This paper focuses on enhancing controllability in video synthesis by employing straightforward bounding boxes to guide the subject in various ways, all without the need for neural network training, finetuning, optimization at inference time, or the use of pre-existing videos. Our algorithm, TrailBlazer, is constructed upon a pre-trained (T2V) model, and easy to implement. The subject is directed by a bounding box through the proposed spatial and temporal attention map editing. Moreover, we introduce the concept of keyframing, allowing the subject trajectory and overall appearance to be guided by both a moving bounding box and corresponding prompts, without the need to provide a detailed mask. The method is efficient, with negligible additional computation relative to the underlying pre-trained model. Despite the simplicity of the bounding box guidance, the resulting motion is surprisingly natural, with emergent effects including perspective and movement toward the virtual camera as the box size increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://hohonu-vicml.github.io/Trailblazer.Page/</p></details> |

This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |

Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS).

We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

LfO can facilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and reducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a transformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and action pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation or inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While several existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity recognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However, SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single viewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the observed task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing occlusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and synchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present multi-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception of multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better recognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two distinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs under occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other baselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance under different ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecture components. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployable state-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI-2024 and 'Towards Reliable and Deployable Learning-Based Robotic Systems' Workshop at CoRL2023</p></details> |

In this regard, a common shortcoming of current benchmark datasets is their limitation to sets of sample trajectories and a lack of actual ground truth distributions, which prevents the use of more expressive error metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance for model evaluation. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic dataset generation based on composite probabilistic B\'ezier curves, which is capable of generating ground truth data in terms of probability distributions over full trajectories. This allows the calculation of arbitrary posterior distributions. The paper showcases an exemplary trajectory prediction model evaluation using generated ground truth distribution data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Methods with Respect to Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05194v3)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we assess the state of the art in pedestrian trajectory prediction within the context of generating single trajectories, a critical aspect aligning with the requirements in autonomous systems. The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS); 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. POP achieves comparable results to top-performing methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Kalman Filtering based on Self-Attention Mechanism and Lattice Trajectory Piecewise Linear Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03915v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional Kalman filter (KF) is widely applied in control systems, but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the system model and noise parameters, leading to potential performance degradation when facing inaccuracies. To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

In contrast to the prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior learned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case trajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent behavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial state, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse population of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT incorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global diversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments with policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous environments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results highlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior beyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

| **[Creating a Trajectory for Code Writing: Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02464v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many students in introductory programming courses fare poorly in the code writing tasks of the final summative assessment. Such tasks are designed to assess whether novices have developed the analytical skills to translate from the given problem domain to coding. In the past researchers have used instruments such as code-explain and found that the extent of cognitive depth reached in these tasks correlated well with code writing ability. However, the need for manual marking and personalized interviews used for identifying cognitive difficulties limited the study to a small group of stragglers. To extend this work to larger groups, we have devised several question types with varying cognitive demands collectively called Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks (ARTs), which do not require manual marking. These tasks require levels of reasoning which can define a learning trajectory. This paper describes these instruments and the machine learning models used for validating them. We have used the data collected in an introductory programming course in the penultimate week of the semester which required attempting ART type instruments and code writing. Our preliminary research suggests ART type instruments can be combined with specific machine learning models to act as an effective learning trajectory and early prediction of code-writing skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj), setting a new benchmark for future research.

| **[Traffic State Estimation from Vehicle Trajectories with Anisotropic Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02311v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately monitoring road traffic state is crucial for various applications, including travel time prediction, traffic control, and traffic safety. However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. We also test the traffic state estimation when traffic flow information is obtained from loop detectors. The results demonstrate the adaptability of our TSE method across different CV penetration rates and types of detectors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in scenarios with sparse observation rates.</p></details> |  |

We propose two prior attention modules, namely Kinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take advantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion trajectory information, to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies and features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic relationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics, while TPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion trajectory across frames. Yielding Q, K, V vectors with prior knowledge, the two modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our KPA and TPA modules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into various transformer-based networks (i.e., diffusion-based) to improve the performance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead.

| **[Traffic State Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification at Signalized Intersections with Low Penetration Rate Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08667v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the traffic state estimation problem at signalized intersections with low penetration rate vehicle trajectory data. While many existing studies have proposed different methods to estimate unknown traffic states and parameters (e.g., penetration rate, queue length) with this data, most of them only provide a point estimation without knowing the uncertainty of these estimated values. It is important to quantify the estimation uncertainty caused by limited available data since it can explicitly inform us whether the available data is sufficient to satisfy the desired estimation accuracy. To fill this gap, we formulate the partially observable system as a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the recently developed probabilistic time-space (PTS) model. The PTS model is a stochastic traffic flow model that is designed for modeling traffic flow dynamics near signalized intersections. Based on the HMM formulation, a single recursive program is developed for the Bayesian estimation of both traffic states and parameters. As a Bayesian approach, the proposed method provides the distributional estimation outcomes and directly quantifies the estimation uncertainty. We validate the proposed method with simulation studies and showcase its applicability to real-world vehicle trajectory data.</p></details> |  |

While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we address this issue by combining a deep learning-based trajectory prediction model with risk potential field-based motion planning. In order to comprehensively predict the possible future trajectories of other vehicles, we propose a target-region based trajectory prediction model(TRTP) which considers every region a vehicle may arrive in the future. After that, we construct a risk potential field at each future time step based on the prediction results of TRTP, and integrate risk value to the objective function of Model Predictive Contouring Control(MPCC). This enables the uncertainty of other vehicles to be taken into account during the planning process. Balancing between risk and progress along the reference path can achieve both driving safety and efficiency at the same time. We also demonstrate the security and effectiveness performance of our method in the CARLA simulator.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly focus on developing compact neural networks to increase prediction precision on public datasets, typically employing a standardized input duration. However, a notable issue arises when these models are evaluated with varying observation lengths, leading to a significant performance drop, a phenomenon we term the Observation Length Shift. To address this issue, we introduce a general and effective framework, the FlexiLength Network (FLN), to enhance the robustness of existing trajectory prediction techniques against varying observation periods. Specifically, FLN integrates trajectory data with diverse observation lengths, incorporates FlexiLength Calibration (FLC) to acquire temporal invariant representations, and employs FlexiLength Adaptation (FLA) to further refine these representations for more accurate future trajectory predictions. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, ie, ETH/UCY, nuScenes, and Argoverse 1, demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FLN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood.

To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. We introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURESTEP: An Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Optimization Framework to Enhance Visual Tool Tracking for Robust Surgical Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00123v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inaccurate tool localization is one of the main reasons for failures in automating surgical tasks. Imprecise robot kinematics and noisy observations caused by the poor visual acuity of an endoscopic camera make tool tracking challenging. Previous works in surgical automation adopt environment-specific setups or hard-coded strategies instead of explicitly considering motion and observation uncertainty of tool tracking in their policies. In this work, we present SURESTEP, an uncertainty-aware trajectory optimization framework for robust surgical automation. We model the uncertainty of tool tracking with the components motivated by the sources of noise in typical surgical scenes. Using a Gaussian assumption to propagate our uncertainty models through a given tool trajectory, SURESTEP provides a general framework that minimizes the upper bound on the entropy of the final estimated tool distribution. We compare SURESTEP with a baseline method on a real-world suture needle regrasping task under challenging environmental conditions, such as poor lighting and a moving endoscopic camera. The results over 60 regrasps on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) demonstrate that our optimized trajectories significantly outperform the un-optimized baseline.</p></details> |  |

| **[SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings. The code can be found here: https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533v4)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents. By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. in "in imagination". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR, March 2024</p></details> |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task. This allows us to utilize the LLM's powerful common sense reasoning abilities to understand complex interactive information, thereby improving the accuracy of long-term predictions. Furthermore, we incorporate explanatory requirements into the prompts in the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only can predict lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides explanations for its predictions, enhancing the interpretability. Extensive experiments on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle: Learning the Angle-based Social Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05370v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians and cars in complex scenes has become more and more significant in many intelligent systems and applications. The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new anglebased trainable social interaction representation, named SocialCircle, for continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively helps better simulate social interactions when forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 accepted |

This trajectory is subsequently refined through sequential quadratic programming to improve its optimality and robustness. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 79.72\% in reducing trajectory planning time.

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning: Role of State Aggregation and Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17091v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the problem of offline reinforcement learning with value function realizability but without Bellman completeness. Previous work by Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022) left open the question whether a bounded concentrability coefficient along with trajectory-based offline data admits a polynomial sample complexity. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to addressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline policy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings are threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is governed by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition Model jointly determined by the function class and the offline data distribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and generalizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022), 2) The concentrability coefficient in the aggregated Markov Transition Model may grow exponentially with the horizon length, even when the concentrability coefficient in the original MDP is small and the offline data is admissible (i.e., the data distribution equals the occupancy measure of some policy), 3) Under value function realizability, there is a generic reduction that can convert any hard instance with admissible data to a hard instance with trajectory data, implying that trajectory data offers no extra benefits over admissible data. These three pieces jointly resolve the open problem, though each of them could be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we 1) decompose our polygonal environment into different overlapping cells 2) write out our polynomial trajectories as the output of a reference dynamical system with given initial conditions 3) formulate convergence and safety constraints as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) on our controller using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and 4) solve a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem with convergence and safety constraints imposed to synthesize a controller for each convex cell. Extensive simulations are included to test our motion planning method under different initial conditions and different reference trajectories. The synthesized controller is robust to changes in initial conditions and is always safe relative to the boundaries of the polygonal environment.</p></details> |  |

This paper for the first time proposes a surveillance system that utilizes low-cost magnetic sensors for detecting and tracking vehicles continuously along the road. The system uses multiple sensors mounted along the roadside and lane boundaries to capture the movement of vehicles. Real-time measurement data is collected by base stations and processed to produce vehicle trajectories that include position, timestamp, and speed. To address the challenge of tracking vehicles continuously on a road network using a large amount of unlabeled magnetic sensor measurements, we first define a vehicle trajectory tracking problem. We then propose a graph-based data association algorithm to track each detected vehicle, and design a related online algorithm framework respectively. We finally validate the performance via both experimental simulation and real-world road deployment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution provides a cost-effective solution to capture the driving status of vehicles and on that basis form various traffic safety and efficiency applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Producing and Leveraging Online Map Uncertainty in Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16439v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition (HD) maps have played an integral role in the development of modern autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks, albeit with high associated labeling and maintenance costs. As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories.

An accurate and robust trajectory tracking method is indispensable for these motion-related modules as a primitive routine.

In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based trajectory tracking method for the motion-related modules in autonomous driving systems. The representation learning ability of DL and the exploration nature of RL bring strong robustness and improve accuracy. Meanwhile, it enhances versatility by running the trajectory tracking in a model-free and data-driven manner.

Moreover, the uncertainty-aware learning procedures in probabilistic approaches lead to robust policies that are less sensitive to noisy observations compared to uncertainty unaware solutions. We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models. During our tests, we place particular emphasis on the robustness of the learned policies with respect to noisy initial states.</p></details> |  |

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance.

In recent years, emerging data-driven deep learning-based methods have shown great promise for these two tasks in learning various traffic scenarios and improving average performance without assuming physical models. However, it remains a challenging problem for these methods to ensure that the generated/predicted trajectories are physically realistic. This challenge arises because learning-based approaches often function as opaque black boxes and do not adhere to physical laws. Conversely, existing model-based methods provide physically feasible results but are constrained by predefined model structures, limiting their capabilities to address complex scenarios. To address the limitations of these two types of approaches, we propose a new method that integrates kinematic knowledge into neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) and designs a variational autoencoder based on this latent kinematics-aware SDE (LK-SDE) to generate vehicle motions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both model-based and learning-based baselines in producing physically realistic and precisely controllable vehicle trajectories.

Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets, resulting in a 30.25% improvement when scaling to 1 billion parameters and 28.98% improvement when increasing size of dataset to eightfold. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 tasks, outclassing previous large models. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, the polynomial nature of this problem renders lab-based identification of adverse reactions insufficient. Dozens of computational approaches have therefore been proposed for the task in recent years, with varying degrees of success. One group of methods that has seemingly been under-utilised in this area is tensor factorisation, despite their clear applicability to this type of data. In this work, we apply three such models to a benchmark dataset in order to compare them against established techniques. We find, in contrast to previous reports, that for this task tensor factorisation models are competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network models and we recommend that future work in this field considers cheaper methods with linear complexity before running costly deep learning processes.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GCN) have been increasingly applied for classifying EEG Motor Imagery signals, primarily because they incorporates the spatial relationships among EEG channels, resulting in improved accuracy over traditional convolutional methods. Recent advances by GCNs-Net in real-time EEG MI signal classification utilised Pearson Coefficient Correlation (PCC) for constructing adjacency matrices, yielding significant results on the PhysioNet dataset. Our paper introduces the EEG Graph Lottery Ticket (EEG_GLT) algorithm, an innovative technique for constructing adjacency matrices for EEG channels. It does not require pre-existing knowledge of inter-channel relationships, and it can be tailored to suit both individual subjects and GCN model architectures. Our findings demonstrated that the PCC method outperformed the Geodesic approach by 9.65% in mean accuracy, while our EEG_GLT matrix consistently exceeded the performance of the PCC method by a mean accuracy of 13.39%. Also, we found that the construction of the adjacency matrix significantly influenced accuracy, to a greater extent than GCN model configurations. A basic GCN configuration utilising our EEG_GLT matrix exceeded the performance of even the most complex GCN setup with a PCC matrix in average accuracy. Our EEG_GLT method also reduced MACs by up to 97% compared to the PCC method, while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. In conclusion, the EEG_GLT algorithm marks a breakthrough in the development of optimal adjacency matrices, effectively boosting both computational accuracy and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time classification of EEG MI signals that demand intensive computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Such graphs are essential for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for handling this graph-structured data. Although gradient descent is commonly utilized for training GNNs for node classification, this study ventures into alternative methods, eliminating the iterative optimization processes. We introduce TrainlessGNN, a linear GNN model capitalizing on the observation that text encodings from the same class often cluster together in a linear subspace. This model constructs a weight matrix to represent each class's node attribute subspace, offering an efficient approach to semi-supervised node classification on TAG. Extensive experiments reveal that our trainless models can either match or even surpass their conventionally trained counterparts, demonstrating the possibility of refraining from gradient descent in certain configurations.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Graph Continual Learning with Debiased Lossless Memory Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10984v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life graph data often expands continually, rendering the learning of graph neural networks (GNNs) on static graph data impractical. Graph continual learning (GCL) tackles this problem by continually adapting GNNs to the expanded graph of the current task while maintaining the performance over the graph of previous tasks. Memory replay-based methods, which aim to replay data of previous tasks when learning new tasks, have been explored as one principled approach to mitigate the forgetting of the knowledge learned from the previous tasks. In this paper we extend this methodology with a novel framework, called Debiased Lossless Memory replay (DeLoMe). Unlike existing methods that sample nodes/edges of previous graphs to construct the memory, DeLoMe learns small lossless synthetic node representations as the memory. The learned memory can not only preserve the graph data privacy but also capture the holistic graph information, for which the sampling-based methods are not viable. Further, prior methods suffer from bias toward the current task due to the data imbalance between the classes in the memory data and the current data. A debiased GCL loss function is devised in DeLoMe to effectively alleviate this bias. Extensive experiments on four graph datasets show the effectiveness of DeLoMe under both class- and task-incremental learning settings.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Interpolation and differentiation of alchemical degrees of freedom in machine learning interatomic potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10746v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a workhorse of modern atomistic simulations, and recently published universal MLIPs, pre-trained on large datasets, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy and generalizability. However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in jet tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in high-energy physics experiments.

Recent developments in Object-Centric Process Mining have enriched event data with objects and their explicit relations between events. To leverage this enriched data, we propose the Heterogeneous Object Event Graph encoding (HOEG), which integrates events and objects into a graph structure with diverse node types. It does so without aggregating object features, thus creating a more nuanced and informative representation. We then adopt a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network architecture, which incorporates these diverse object features in prediction tasks. We evaluate the performance and scalability of HOEG in predicting remaining time, benchmarking it against two established graph-based encodings and two baseline models. Our evaluation uses three Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs), including one from a real-life process at a major Dutch financial institution. The results indicate that HOEG competes well with existing models and surpasses them when OCELs contain informative object attributes and event-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to 36th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAISE), 2024</p></details> |

Numerous strategies have been proposed for predicting PPIs, and among them, graph-based methods have demonstrated promising outcomes owing to the inherent graph structure of PPI networks. This paper reviews various graph-based methodologies, and discusses their applications in PPI prediction. We classify these approaches into two primary groups based on their model structures. The first category employs Graph Neural Networks (GNN) or Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), while the second category utilizes Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Auto-Encoders and Graph-BERT. We highlight the distinctive methodologies of each approach in managing the graph-structured data inherent in PPI networks and anticipate future research directions in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGHINT: Attribute-Guided Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Information Networks with Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10443v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved impressive success in representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies and heterogeneity at the node level. However, few existing studies have delved into the utilization of node attributes in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). In this paper, we investigate the impact of inter-node attribute disparities on HGNNs performance within the benchmark task, i.e., node classification, and empirically find that typical models exhibit significant performance decline when classifying nodes whose attributes markedly differ from their neighbors. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Attribute-Guided heterogeneous Information Networks representation learning model with Transformer (AGHINT), which allows a more effective aggregation of neighbor node information under the guidance of attributes. Specifically, AGHINT transcends the constraints of the original graph structure by directly integrating higher-order similar neighbor features into the learning process and modifies the message-passing mechanism between nodes based on their attribute disparities. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graph benchmarks with target node attributes demonstrate that AGHINT outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Specifically, optimization-based smoothing is used for high-quality mesh smoothing, but it incurs significant computational overhead. Pioneer works improve its smoothing efficiency by adopting supervised learning to learn smoothing methods from high-quality meshes. However, they pose difficulty in smoothing the mesh nodes with varying degrees and also need data augmentation to address the node input sequence problem. Additionally, the required labeled high-quality meshes further limit the applicability of the proposed method. In this paper, we present GMSNet, a lightweight neural network model for intelligent mesh smoothing. GMSNet adopts graph neural networks to extract features of the node's neighbors and output the optimal node position. During smoothing, we also introduce a fault-tolerance mechanism to prevent GMSNet from generating negative volume elements. With a lightweight model, GMSNet can effectively smoothing mesh nodes with varying degrees and remain unaffected by the order of input data. A novel loss function, MetricLoss, is also developed to eliminate the need for high-quality meshes, which provides a stable and rapid convergence during training. We compare GMSNet with commonly used mesh smoothing methods on two-dimensional triangle meshes. The experimental results show that GMSNet achieves outstanding mesh smoothing performances with 5% model parameters of the previous model, and attains 13.56 times faster than optimization-based smoothing.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD) is the scarcity of high-quality data, which often requires extensive wet-lab work. A typical example of this is pharmacokinetic experiments. In this work, we develop a physical formula enhanced mul-ti-task learning (PEMAL) method that predicts four key parameters of pharmacokinetics simultaneously. By incorporating physical formulas into the multi-task framework, PEMAL facilitates effective knowledge sharing and target alignment among the pharmacokinetic parameters, thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction. Our experiments reveal that PEMAL significantly lowers the data demand, compared to typical Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that PEMAL enhances the robustness to noise, an advantage that conventional Neural Networks do not possess. Another advantage of PEMAL is its high flexibility, which can be potentially applied to other multi-task machine learning scenarios. Overall, our work illustrates the benefits and potential of using PEMAL in AIDD and other scenarios with data scarcity and noise.</p></details> |  |

Existing spectral GNNs mainly emphasize polynomial properties in filter design, introducing computational overhead and neglecting the integration of crucial graph structure information. We argue that incorporating graph information into basis construction can enhance understanding of polynomial basis, and further facilitate simplified polynomial filter design. Motivated by this, we first propose a Positive and Negative Coupling Analysis (PNCA) framework, where the concepts of positive and negative activation are defined and their respective and mixed effects are analysed. Then, we explore PNCA from the message propagation perspective, revealing the subtle information hidden in the activation process. Subsequently, PNCA is used to analyze the mainstream polynomial filters, and a novel simple basis that decouples the positive and negative activation and fully utilizes graph structure information is designed. Finally, a simple GNN (called GSCNet) is proposed based on the new basis. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets for node classification verify that our GSCNet obtains better or comparable results compared with existing state-of-the-art GNNs while demanding relatively less computational time.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</p></details> |  |
| **[DE-HNN: An effective neural model for Circuit Netlist representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00477v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The run-time for optimization tools used in chip design has grown with the complexity of designs to the point where it can take several days to go through one design cycle which has become a bottleneck. Designers want fast tools that can quickly give feedback on a design. Using the input and output data of the tools from past designs, one can attempt to build a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of a design in significantly shorter time than running the tool. The accuracy of such models is affected by the representation of the design data, which is usually a netlist that describes the elements of the digital circuit and how they are connected. Graph representations for the netlist together with graph neural networks have been investigated for such models. However, the characteristics of netlists pose several challenges for existing graph learning frameworks, due to the large number of nodes and the importance of long-range interactions between nodes. To address these challenges, we represent the netlist as a directed hypergraph and propose a Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Network (DE-HNN) for the effective learning of (directed) hypergraphs. Theoretically, we show that our DE-HNN can universally approximate any node or hyperedge based function that satisfies certain permutation equivariant and invariant properties natural for directed hypergraphs. We compare the proposed DE-HNN with several State-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models for (hyper)graphs and netlists, and show that the DE-HNN significantly outperforms them in predicting the outcome of optimized place-and-route tools directly from the input netlists. Our source code and the netlists data used are publicly available at https://github.com/YusuLab/chips.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Causal Representation Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03597v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph few-shot learning (HGFL) has been developed to address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which consist of various types of nodes and edges. The core concept of HGFL is to extract knowledge from rich-labeled classes in a source HG, transfer this knowledge to a target HG to facilitate learning new classes with few-labeled training data, and finally make predictions on unlabeled testing data. Existing methods typically assume that the source HG, training data, and testing data all share the same distribution. However, in practice, distribution shifts among these three types of data are inevitable due to two reasons: (1) the limited availability of the source HG that matches the target HG distribution, and (2) the unpredictable data generation mechanism of the target HG. Such distribution shifts result in ineffective knowledge transfer and poor learning performance in existing methods, thereby leading to a novel problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in HGFL. To address this challenging problem, we propose a novel Causal OOD Heterogeneous graph Few-shot learning model, namely COHF. In COHF, we first characterize distribution shifts in HGs with a structural causal model, establishing an invariance principle for OOD generalization in HGFL. Then, following this invariance principle, we propose a new variational autoencoder-based heterogeneous graph neural network to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts. Finally, by integrating this network with a novel meta-learning framework, COHF effectively transfers knowledge to the target HG to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of COHF over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization of Graph Neural Networks through the Lens of Homomorphism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06079v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the celebrated popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across numerous applications, the ability of GNNs to generalize remains less explored. In this work, we propose to study the generalization of GNNs through a novel perspective - analyzing the entropy of graph homomorphism. By linking graph homomorphism with information-theoretic measures, we derive generalization bounds for both graph and node classifications. These bounds are capable of capturing subtleties inherent in various graph structures, including but not limited to paths, cycles and cliques. This enables a data-dependent generalization analysis with robust theoretical guarantees. To shed light on the generality of of our proposed bounds, we present a unifying framework that can characterize a broad spectrum of GNN models through the lens of graph homomorphism. We validate the practical applicability of our theoretical findings by showing the alignment between the proposed bounds and the empirically observed generalization gaps over both real-world and synthetic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Experiments demonstrate that our user-hashtag heuristic and the semi-supervised GNN method outperform zero-shot stance labeling using LLMs such as GPT4. Further analysis illustrates how the stance labeling information and interaction graph can be used for evaluating the polarization of social media interactions on divisive issues such as climate change and gun control.</p></details> |  |

The first approach, Scattering Transform with E-GraphSAGE (STEG), utilizes the scattering transform to conduct multi-resolution analysis of edge feature vectors. This provides a detailed representation that is essential for identifying subtle anomalies in network traffic. The second approach improves node representation by initiating with Node2Vec, diverging from standard methods of using uniform values, thereby capturing a more accurate and holistic network picture. Our methods have shown significant improvements in performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmark NIDS datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06177v5)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</p></details> |  |

Tree Containment asks whether the given phylogenetic tree (for instance, constructed from a DNA fragment showing tree-like evolution) is contained in the given phylogenetic network. In the general case, this is an NP-complete problem. We propose to solve it approximately using Graph Neural Networks. In particular, we propose to combine the given network and the tree and apply a Graph Neural Network to this network-tree graph. This way, we achieve the capability of solving the tree containment instances representing a larger number of species than the instances contained in the training dataset (i.e., our algorithm has the inductive learning ability). Our algorithm demonstrates an accuracy of over $95\%$ in solving the tree containment problem on instances with up to 100 leaves.</p></details> |  |

However, due to differences in the subgrid physics implementation and numerical approximations across different simulation suites, models trained on data from one cosmological simulation show a drop in performance when tested on another. Similarly, models trained on any of the simulations would also likely experience a drop in performance when applied to observational data. Training on data from two different suites of the CAMELS hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, we examine the generalization capabilities of Domain Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (DA-GNNs). By utilizing GNNs, we capitalize on their capacity to capture structured scale-free cosmological information from galaxy distributions. Moreover, by including unsupervised domain adaptation via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), we enable our models to extract domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that DA-GNN achieves higher accuracy and robustness on cross-dataset tasks (up to $28\%$ better relative error and up to almost an order of magnitude better $\chi^2$). Using data visualizations, we show the effects of domain adaptation on proper latent space data alignment. This shows that DA-GNNs are a promising method for extracting domain-independent cosmological information, a vital step toward robust deep learning for real cosmic survey data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at NeurIPS 2023; 9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Many prior studies overlook diverse vulnerability characteristics, simplifying the problem into a binary (0-1) classification task for example determining whether it is vulnerable or not. This poses a challenge for a single deep learning-based model to effectively learn the wide array of vulnerability characteristics. Furthermore, due to the challenges associated with collecting large-scale vulnerability data, these detectors often overfit limited training datasets, resulting in lower model generalization performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we introduce a fine-grained vulnerability detector namely FGVulDet. Unlike previous approaches, FGVulDet employs multiple classifiers to discern characteristics of various vulnerability types and combines their outputs to identify the specific type of vulnerability. Each classifier is designed to learn type-specific vulnerability semantics. Additionally, to address the scarcity of data for some vulnerability types and enhance data diversity for learning better vulnerability semantics, we propose a novel vulnerability-preserving data augmentation technique to augment the number of vulnerabilities. Taking inspiration from recent advancements in graph neural networks for learning program semantics, we incorporate a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) and extend it to an edge-aware GGNN to capture edge-type information. FGVulDet is trained on a large-scale dataset from GitHub, encompassing five different types of vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments compared with static-analysis-based approaches and learning-based approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of FGVulDet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference from Real-World Sparse Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11269v7)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world problems often involve complex and unstructured sets of measurements, which occur when sensors are sparsely placed in either space or time. Being able to model this irregular spatiotemporal data and extract meaningful forecasts is crucial. Deep learning architectures capable of processing sets of measurements with positions varying from set to set, and extracting readouts anywhere are methodologically difficult. Current state-of-the-art models are graph neural networks and require domain-specific knowledge for proper setup. We propose an attention-based model focused on robustness and practical applicability, with two key design contributions. First, we adopt a ViT-like transformer that takes both context points and read-out positions as inputs, eliminating the need for an encoder-decoder structure. Second, we use a unified method for encoding both context and read-out positions. This approach is intentionally straightforward and integrates well with other systems. Compared to existing approaches, our model is simpler, requires less specialized knowledge, and does not suffer from a problematic bottleneck effect, all of which contribute to superior performance. We conduct in-depth ablation studies that characterize this problematic bottleneck in the latent representations of alternative models that inhibit information utilization and impede training efficiency. We also perform experiments across various problem domains, including high-altitude wind nowcasting, two-day weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, and heat diffusion. Our attention-based model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in handling irregularly sampled data. Notably, our model reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) for wind nowcasting from 9.24 to 7.98 and for heat diffusion tasks from 0.126 to 0.084.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 12 figures, Published at TMLR https://openreview.net/forum?id=y9IDfODRns</p></details> |

Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) \emph{Non-uniqueness}: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) \emph{Instability}: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address non-uniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a ``hard partition'' of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to ``softly partition'' eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods.

Recent advances in graph neural networks-based data imputation solutions show their strong structure learning potential by directly translating tabular data as bipartite graphs. However, due to a lack of relations between samples, those solutions treat all samples equally which is against one important observation: ``similar sample should give more information about missing values." This paper presents a novel Iterative graph Generation and Reconstruction framework for Missing data imputation(IGRM). Instead of treating all samples equally, we introduce the concept: ``friend networks" to represent different relations among samples. To generate an accurate friend network with missing data, an end-to-end friend network reconstruction solution is designed to allow for continuous friend network optimization during imputation learning. The representation of the optimized friend network, in turn, is used to further optimize the data imputation process with differentiated message passing. Experiment results on eight benchmark datasets show that IGRM yields 39.13% lower mean absolute error compared with nine baselines and 9.04% lower than the second-best.

However, these GNN-based RS inadvertently introduce excess linear correlation between user and item embeddings, contradicting the goal of providing personalized recommendations. While existing research predominantly ascribes this flaw to the over-smoothing problem, this paper underscores the critical, often overlooked role of the over-correlation issue in diminishing the effectiveness of GNN representations and subsequent recommendation performance. Up to now, the over-correlation issue remains unexplored in RS. Meanwhile, how to mitigate the impact of over-correlation while preserving collaborative filtering signals is a significant challenge. To this end, this paper aims to address the aforementioned gap by undertaking a comprehensive study of the over-correlation issue in graph collaborative filtering models. Firstly, we present empirical evidence to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of over-correlation in these models. Subsequently, we dive into a theoretical analysis which establishes a pivotal connection between the over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Adaptive Feature De-correlation Graph Collaborative Filtering (AFDGCF) framework, which dynamically applies correlation penalties to the feature dimensions of the representation matrix, effectively alleviating both over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. The efficacy of the proposed framework is corroborated through extensive experiments conducted with four representative graph collaborative filtering models across four publicly available datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR2024</p></details> |

Our objective is to address the challenge of scaling edge-based graph neural networks as the number of nodes increases. Through our distributed training approach, coupled with Nystr\"om-approximation sampling techniques, we present a scalable graph neural network, referred to as DS-MPNN (D and S standing for distributed and sampled, respectively), capable of scaling up to $O(10^5)$ nodes. We validate our sampling and distributed training approach on two cases: (a) a Darcy flow dataset and (b) steady RANS simulations of 2-D airfoils, providing comparisons with both single-GPU implementation and node-based graph convolution networks (GCNs). The DS-MPNN model demonstrates comparable accuracy to single-GPU implementation, can accommodate a significantly larger number of nodes compared to the single-GPU variant (S-MPNN), and significantly outperforms the node-based GCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Attention Models for Multi-Relational Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09365v1)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Bi-Level Attention-Based Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (BR-GCN), unique neural network architectures that utilize masked self-attentional layers with relational graph convolutions, to effectively operate on highly multi-relational data. BR-GCN models use bi-level attention to learn node embeddings through (1) node-level attention, and (2) relation-level attention. The node-level self-attentional layers use intra-relational graph interactions to learn relation-specific node embeddings using a weighted aggregation of neighborhood features in a sparse subgraph region. The relation-level self-attentional layers use inter-relational graph interactions to learn the final node embeddings using a weighted aggregation of relation-specific node embeddings. The BR-GCN bi-level attention mechanism extends Transformer-based multiplicative attention from the natural language processing (NLP) domain, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT)-based attention, to large-scale heterogeneous graphs (HGs). On node classification, BR-GCN outperforms baselines from 0.29% to 14.95% as a stand-alone model, and on link prediction, BR-GCN outperforms baselines from 0.02% to 7.40% as an auto-encoder model. We also conduct ablation studies to evaluate the quality of BR-GCN's relation-level attention and discuss how its learning of graph structure may be transferred to enrich other graph neural networks (GNNs). Through various experiments, we show that BR-GCN's attention mechanism is both scalable and more effective in learning compared to state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Message Passing-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for OTFS Data Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10071v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising solution to support high-mobility wireless communications, for which, cost-effective data detectors are critical. Although graph neural network (GNN)-based data detectors can achieve decent detection accuracy at reasonable computational cost, they fail to best harness prior information of transmitted data. To further minimize the data detection error of OTFS systems, this letter develops an AMP-GNN-based detector, leveraging the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to iteratively improve the symbol estimates of a GNN. Given the inter-Doppler interference (IDI) symbols incur substantial computational overhead to the constructed GNN, learning-based IDI approximation is implemented to sustain low detection complexity. Simulation results demonstrate a remarkable bit error rate (BER) performance achieved by the proposed AMP-GNN-based detector compared to existing baselines. Meanwhile, the proposed IDI approximation scheme avoids a large amount of computations with negligible BER degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, and 3 tables.

| **[Node Classification in Random Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12167v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for the classification of objects that are structured as random trees. Our aim is to model a distribution over the node label assignments in settings where the tree data structure is associated with node attributes (typically high dimensional embeddings). The tree topology is not predetermined and none of the label assignments are present during inference. Other methods that produce a distribution over node label assignment in trees (or more generally in graphs) either assume conditional independence of the label assignment, operate on a fixed graph topology, or require part of the node labels to be observed. Our method defines a Markov Network with the corresponding topology of the random tree and an associated Gibbs distribution. We parameterize the Gibbs distribution with a Graph Neural Network that operates on the random tree and the node embeddings. This allows us to estimate the likelihood of node assignments for a given random tree and use MCMC to sample from the distribution of node assignments. We evaluate our method on the tasks of node classification in trees on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. Our method outperforms the baselines on this dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for modeling joint distributions of node labels in random trees.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEGNN: Dual Experts Graph Neural Network Handling Both Edge and Node Feature Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09207v1)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved notable success in various applications over graph data. However, recent research has revealed that real-world graphs often contain noise, and GNNs are susceptible to noise in the graph. To address this issue, several Graph Structure Learning (GSL) models have been introduced. While GSL models are tailored to enhance robustness against edge noise through edge reconstruction, a significant limitation surfaces: their high reliance on node features. This inherent dependence amplifies their susceptibility to noise within node features. Recognizing this vulnerability, we present DEGNN, a novel GNN model designed to adeptly mitigate noise in both edges and node features. The core idea of DEGNN is to design two separate experts: an edge expert and a node feature expert. These experts utilize self-supervised learning techniques to produce modified edges and node features. Leveraging these modified representations, DEGNN subsequently addresses downstream tasks, ensuring robustness against noise present in both edges and node features of real-world graphs. Notably, the modification process can be trained end-to-end, empowering DEGNN to adjust dynamically and achieves optimal edge and node representations for specific tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DEGNN's efficacy in managing noise, both in original real-world graphs and in graphs with synthetic noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>PAKDD...</summary><p>PAKDD 2024, the code is available at https://github.com/TaiHasegawa/DEGNN</p></details> |

However, most existing methods have the homogeneity assumption and show poor performance on heterophilic graphs, where the linked nodes have dissimilar features and different class labels, and the semantically related nodes might be multi-hop away. To address this limitation, this paper presents GraphRARE, a general framework built upon node relative entropy and deep reinforcement learning, to strengthen the expressive capability of GNNs. An innovative node relative entropy, which considers node features and structural similarity, is used to measure mutual information between node pairs. In addition, to avoid the sub-optimal solutions caused by mixing useful information and noises of remote nodes, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed to optimize the graph topology. This algorithm selects informative nodes and discards noisy nodes based on the defined node relative entropy. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of GraphRARE in node classification and its capability to optimize the original graph topology.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Networks with Diverse Spectral Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09041v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph machine learning, with polynomial filters applied for graph convolutions, where all nodes share the identical filter weights to mine their local contexts. Despite the success, existing spectral GNNs usually fail to deal with complex networks (e.g., WWW) due to such homogeneous spectral filtering setting that ignores the regional heterogeneity as typically seen in real-world networks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel diverse spectral filtering (DSF) framework, which automatically learns node-specific filter weights to exploit the varying local structure properly. Particularly, the diverse filter weights consist of two components -- A global one shared among all nodes, and a local one that varies along network edges to reflect node difference arising from distinct graph parts -- to balance between local and global information. As such, not only can the global graph characteristics be captured, but also the diverse local patterns can be mined with awareness of different node positions. Interestingly, we formulate a novel optimization problem to assist in learning diverse filters, which also enables us to enhance any spectral GNNs with our DSF framework. We showcase the proposed framework on three state-of-the-arts including GPR-GNN, BernNet, and JacobiConv. Extensive experiments over 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently boost model performance by up to 4.92% in node classification tasks, producing diverse filters with enhanced interpretability.

| **[ES-GNN: Generalizing Graph Neural Networks Beyond Homophily with Edge Splitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13700v3)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved enormous success in multiple graph analytical tasks, modern variants mostly rely on the strong inductive bias of homophily. However, real-world networks typically exhibit both homophilic and heterophilic linking patterns, wherein adjacent nodes may share dissimilar attributes and distinct labels. Therefore, GNNs smoothing node proximity holistically may aggregate both task-relevant and irrelevant (even harmful) information, limiting their ability to generalize to heterophilic graphs and potentially causing non-robustness. In this work, we propose a novel Edge Splitting GNN (ES-GNN) framework to adaptively distinguish between graph edges either relevant or irrelevant to learning tasks. This essentially transfers the original graph into two subgraphs with the same node set but complementary edge sets dynamically. Given that, information propagation separately on these subgraphs and edge splitting are alternatively conducted, thus disentangling the task-relevant and irrelevant features. Theoretically, we show that our ES-GNN can be regarded as a solution to a disentangled graph denoising problem, which further illustrates our motivations and interprets the improved generalization beyond homophily. Extensive experiments over 11 benchmark and 1 synthetic datasets not only demonstrate the effective performance of ES-GNN but also highlight its robustness to adversarial graphs and mitigation of the over-smoothing problem.</p></details> | Under review |

In this work, we address the problem of choosing the most informative views that minimize survey time while maximizing classifier accuracy. We introduce a novel active perception framework for multi-view adaptive surveying and reacquisition using side scan sonar imagery. Our framework addresses this challenge by using a graph formulation for the adaptive survey task. We then use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to both classify acquired sonar views and to choose the next best view based on the collected data. We evaluate our method using simulated surveys in a high-fidelity side scan sonar simulator. Our results demonstrate that our approach is able to surpass the state-of-the-art in classification accuracy and survey efficiency. This framework is a promising approach for more efficient autonomous missions involving side scan sonar, such as underwater exploration, marine archaeology, and environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything Model for Road Network Graph Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16051v3)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SAM-Road, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for extracting large-scale, vectorized road network graphs from satellite imagery. To predict graph geometry, we formulate it as a dense semantic segmentation task, leveraging the inherent strengths of SAM. The image encoder of SAM is fine-tuned to produce probability masks for roads and intersections, from which the graph vertices are extracted via simple non-maximum suppression. To predict graph topology, we designed a lightweight transformer-based graph neural network, which leverages the SAM image embeddings to estimate the edge existence probabilities between vertices. Our approach directly predicts the graph vertices and edges for large regions without expensive and complex post-processing heuristics, and is capable of building complete road network graphs spanning multiple square kilometers in a matter of seconds. With its simple, straightforward, and minimalist design, SAM-Road achieves comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art method RNGDet++, while being 40 times faster on the City-scale dataset. We thus demonstrate the power of a foundational vision model when applied to a graph learning task.

| **[Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11004v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, such as recommendation, drug discovery, and question answering. Behind the success of GNNs lies the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the de facto standard for training deep neural networks (NNs). However, despite its effectiveness, BP imposes several constraints, which are not only biologically implausible, but also limit the scalability, parallelism, and flexibility in learning NNs. Examples of such constraints include storage of neural activities computed in the forward pass for use in the subsequent backward pass, and the dependence of parameter updates on non-local signals. To address these limitations, the forward-forward algorithm (FF) was recently proposed as an alternative to BP in the image classification domain, which trains NNs by performing two forward passes over positive and negative data. Inspired by this advance, we propose ForwardGNN in this work, a new forward learning procedure for GNNs, which avoids the constraints imposed by BP via an effective layer-wise local forward training. ForwardGNN extends the original FF to deal with graph data and GNNs, and makes it possible to operate without generating negative inputs (hence no longer forward-forward). Further, ForwardGNN enables each layer to learn from both the bottom-up and top-down signals without relying on the backpropagation of errors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed forward graph learning framework. We release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/forwardgnn.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each BS selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each BS, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the BSs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Indeed, this approach is currently a hot topic in the glassy liquids community, where the state of the art consists in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have great expressive power but are heavy models and lack interpretability. Inspired by recent advances in the field of Machine Learning group-equivariant representations, we build a GNN that learns a robust representation of the glass' static structure by constraining it to preserve the roto-translation (SE(3)) equivariance. We show that this constraint significantly improves the predictive power at comparable or reduced number of parameters but most importantly, improves the ability to generalize to unseen temperatures. While remaining a Deep network, our model has improved interpretability compared to other GNNs, as the action of our basic convolution layer relates directly to well-known rotation-invariant expert features. Through transfer-learning experiments displaying unprecedented performance, we demonstrate that our network learns a robust representation, which allows us to push forward the idea of a learned structural order parameter for glasses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SciPost. 15 pages, 9 figures plus references and 4 pages of appendix</p></details> |

Its application has been particularly important in identifying underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Autism. Recent analysis of fMRI data models the brain as a graph and extracts features by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the unique characteristics of fMRI data require a special design of GNN. Tailoring GNN to generate effective and domain-explainable features remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive dual-attention block and a differentiable graph pooling method called ContrastPool to better utilize GNN for brain networks, meeting fMRI-specific requirements. We apply our method to 5 resting-state fMRI brain network datasets of 3 diseases and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Our case study confirms that the patterns extracted by our method match the domain knowledge in neuroscience literature, and disclose direct and interesting insights. Our contributions underscore the potential of ContrastPool for advancing the understanding of brain networks and neurodegenerative conditions.

It goes further than identifying the objects in an image, and instead, it attempts to understand the scene. Solutions to this problem form the underpinning of a range of tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and image retrieval. Graphs provide a natural way to represent the relational arrangement between objects in an image, and thus, in recent years graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a standard component of many 2D image understanding pipelines, becoming a core architectural component, especially in the VQA group of tasks. In this survey, we review this rapidly evolving field and we provide a taxonomy of graph types used in 2D image understanding approaches, a comprehensive list of the GNN models used in this domain, and a roadmap of future potential developments.

In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, GNN-based methods often struggle with noisy and missing edges between messages, affecting the quality of learned message embedding. Moreover, these methods statically initialize node embedding before training, which, in turn, limits the ability to learn from message texts and relations simultaneously. In this paper, we approach social event detection from a new perspective based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and present RPLM_SED (Relational prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection). We first propose a new pairwise message modeling strategy to construct social messages into message pairs with multi-relational sequences. Secondly, a new multi-relational prompt-based pairwise message learning mechanism is proposed to learn more comprehensive message representation from message pairs with multi-relational prompts using PLMs. Thirdly, we design a new clustering constraint to optimize the encoding process by enhancing intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster dispersion, making the message representation more distinguishable. We evaluate the RPLM_SED on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the RPLM_SED model achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline, online, low-resource, and long-tail distribution scenarios for social event detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM TOIS Under Review</p></details> |

We train roBERTa Transformer-based sequence classification models using our proprietary dataset of 44,227 sentences. Upon classifying tokens in a sentence as entities or relationships, our method uses another classifier to identify specific relationship tokens for a given pair of entities.

By fostering new levels of automation, efficiency, and predictive maintenance, IIoT is transforming traditional industries into intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems. However, achieving highly reliable IIoT can be hindered by factors such as the cost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting existing systems with sensors, or harsh environmental conditions that may make sensor installation impractical. Soft (virtual) sensing leverages mathematical models to estimate variables from physical sensor data, offering a solution to these challenges. Data-driven and physics-based modeling are the two main methodologies widely used for soft sensing. The choice between these strategies depends on the complexity of the underlying system, with the data-driven approach often being preferred when the physics-based inference models are intricate and present challenges for state estimation. However, conventional deep learning models are typically hindered by their inability to explicitly represent the complex interactions among various sensors. To address this limitation, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), renowned for their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between sensor measurements. In this research, we propose physics-enhanced GNNs, which integrate principles of physics into graph-based methodologies. This is achieved by augmenting additional nodes in the input graph derived from the underlying characteristics of the physical processes. Our evaluation of the proposed methodology on the case study of district heating networks reveals significant improvements over purely data-driven GNNs, even in the presence of noise and parameter inaccuracies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Traditionally, calculating the manually constructed molecular conformations of transition states for chemical reactions using quantum chemical calculations is the most commonly used method. However, this way is heavily dependent on individual experience and chemical intuition. In our previous study, we proposed a research paradigm that uses enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics simulations to study chemical reactions. This approach can directly simulate the entire process of a chemical reaction. However, the computational speed limits the use of high-precision potential energy functions for simulations. To address this issue, we present a scheme for training high-precision force fields for molecular modeling using a previously developed graph-neural-network-based molecular model, molecular configuration transformer. This potential energy function allows for highly accurate simulations at a low computational cost, leading to more precise calculations of the mechanism of chemical reactions. We applied this approach to study a Claisen rearrangement reaction and a Carbonyl insertion reaction catalyzed by Manganese.</p></details> |  |

Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advancements in digital pathology and high-throughput genome sequencing, establishing effective multi-modal fusion models for survival prediction and revealing the potential association between histopathology and transcriptomics remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Genome Heterogeneous Graph (PGHG) that integrates whole slide images (WSI) and bulk RNA-Seq expression data with heterogeneous graph neural network for cancer survival analysis. The PGHG consists of biological knowledge-guided representation learning network and pathology-genome heterogeneous graph. The representation learning network utilizes the biological prior knowledge of intra-modal and inter-modal data associations to guide the feature extraction. The node features of each modality are updated through attention-based graph learning strategy. Unimodal features and bi-modal fused features are extracted via attention pooling module and then used for survival prediction. We evaluate the model on low-grade gliomas, glioblastoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (FAHZU). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both unimodal and other multi-modal fusion models. For demonstrating the model interpretability, we also visualize the attention heatmap of pathological images and utilize integrated gradient algorithm to identify important tissue structure, biological pathways and key genes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN-based Probabilistic Supply and Inventory Predictions in Supply Chain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07523v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful supply chain optimization must mitigate imbalances between supply and demand over time. While accurate demand prediction is essential for supply planning, it alone does not suffice. The key to successful supply planning for optimal and viable execution lies in maximizing predictability for both demand and supply throughout an execution horizon. Therefore, enhancing the accuracy of supply predictions is imperative to create an attainable supply plan that matches demand without overstocking or understocking. However, in complex supply chain networks with numerous nodes and edges, accurate supply predictions are challenging due to dynamic node interactions, cascading supply delays, resource availability, production and logistic capabilities. Consequently, supply executions often deviate from their initial plans. To address this, we present the Graph-based Supply Prediction (GSP) probabilistic model. Our attention-based graph neural network (GNN) model predicts supplies, inventory, and imbalances using graph-structured historical data, demand forecasting, and original supply plan inputs. The experiments, conducted using historical data from a global consumer goods company's large-scale supply chain, demonstrate that GSP significantly improves supply and inventory prediction accuracy, potentially offering supply plan corrections to optimize executions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Probabilistic Planning for Optimizing Supply Chain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07511v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain networks in enterprises are typically composed of complex topological graphs involving various types of nodes and edges, accommodating numerous products with considerable demand and supply variability. However, as supply chain networks expand in size and complexity, traditional supply chain planning methods (e.g., those found in heuristic rule-based and operations research-based systems) tend to become locally optimal or lack computational scalability, resulting in substantial imbalances between supply and demand across nodes in the network. This paper introduces a novel Generative AI technique, which we call Generative Probabilistic Planning (GPP). GPP generates dynamic supply action plans that are globally optimized across all network nodes over the time horizon for changing objectives like maximizing profits or service levels, factoring in time-varying probabilistic demand, lead time, and production conditions. GPP leverages attention-based graph neural networks (GNN), offline deep reinforcement learning (Offline RL), and policy simulations to train generative policy models and create optimal plans through probabilistic simulations, effectively accounting for various uncertainties. Our experiments using historical data from a global consumer goods company with complex supply chain networks demonstrate that GPP accomplishes objective-adaptable, probabilistically resilient, and dynamic planning for supply chain networks, leading to significant improvements in performance and profitability for enterprises. Our work plays a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of AI adoption within the supply chain domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art.

| **[Characterizing the Influence of Topology on Graph Learning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07493v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of tasks by encoding features combined with topology to create effective representations. However, the fundamental problem of understanding and analyzing how graph topology influences the performance of learning models on downstream tasks has not yet been well understood. In this paper, we propose a metric, TopoInf, which characterizes the influence of graph topology by measuring the level of compatibility between the topological information of graph data and downstream task objectives. We provide analysis based on the decoupled GNNs on the contextual stochastic block model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TopoInf is an effective metric for measuring topological influence on corresponding tasks and can be further leveraged to enhance graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Knowledge Adaptation for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10839v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph structured data often possess dynamic characters in nature. Recent years have witnessed the increasing attentions paid to dynamic graph neural networks for modelling graph data. However, almost all existing approaches operate under the assumption that, upon the establishment of a new link, the embeddings of the neighboring nodes should undergo updates to learn temporal dynamics. Nevertheless, these approaches face the following limitation: If the node introduced by a new connection contains noisy information, propagating its knowledge to other nodes becomes unreliable and may even lead to the collapse of the model. In this paper, we propose Ada-DyGNN: a robust knowledge Adaptation framework via reinforcement learning for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks. In contrast to previous approaches, which update the embeddings of the neighbor nodes immediately after adding a new link, Ada-DyGNN adaptively determines which nodes should be updated. Considering that the decision to update the embedding of one neighbor node can significantly impact other neighbor nodes, we conceptualize the node update selection as a sequence decision problem and employ reinforcement learning to address it effectively. By this means, we can adaptively propagate knowledge to other nodes for learning robust node embedding representations. To the best of our knowledge, our approach constitutes the first attempt to explore robust knowledge adaptation via reinforcement learning specifically tailored for dynamic graph neural networks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ada-DyGNN achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we conduct experiments by introducing different degrees of noise into the dataset, quantitatively and qualitatively illustrating the robustness of Ada-DyGNN.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has heralded a new era in deep learning. However, their application to graph data poses distinct challenges due to the inherent difficulty of translating graph structures to language. To this end, we introduce the Large Language and Graph Assistant (LLaGA), an innovative model that effectively integrates LLM capabilities to handle the complexities of graph-structured data. LLaGA retains the general-purpose nature of LLMs while adapting graph data into a format compatible with LLM input. LLaGA achieves this by reorganizing graph nodes to structure-aware sequences and then mapping these into the token embedding space through a versatile projector. LLaGA excels in versatility, generalizability and interpretability, allowing it to perform consistently well across different datasets and tasks, extend its ability to unseen datasets or tasks, and provide explanations for graphs. Our extensive experiments across popular graph benchmarks show that LLaGA delivers outstanding performance across four datasets and three tasks using one single model, surpassing state-of-the-art graph models in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios.

| **[Less is More: Hop-Wise Graph Attention for Scalable and Generalizable Learning on Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01317v4)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for learning circuit representations in various electronic design automation (EDA) tasks, they face challenges in scalability when applied to large graphs and exhibit limited generalizability to new designs. These limitations make them less practical for addressing large-scale, complex circuit problems. In this work we propose HOGA, a novel attention-based model for learning circuit representations in a scalable and generalizable manner. HOGA first computes hop-wise features per node prior to model training. Subsequently, the hop-wise features are solely used to produce node representations through a gated self-attention module, which adaptively learns important features among different hops without involving the graph topology. As a result, HOGA is adaptive to various structures across different circuits and can be efficiently trained in a distributed manner. To demonstrate the efficacy of HOGA, we consider two representative EDA tasks: quality of results (QoR) prediction and functional reasoning. Our experimental results indicate that (1) HOGA reduces estimation error over conventional GNNs by 46.76% for predicting QoR after logic synthesis; (2) HOGA improves 10.0% reasoning accuracy over GNNs for identifying functional blocks on unseen gate-level netlists after complex technology mapping; (3) The training time for HOGA almost linearly decreases with an increase in computing resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2024</p></details> |

Binding site identification methods can now profit from the availability of large amounts of 3D structures in protein structure databases or from AlphaFold predictions. Current binding site identification methods heavily rely on graph neural networks (GNNs), usually designed to output E(3)-equivariant predictions. Such methods turned out to be very beneficial for physics-related tasks like binding energy or motion trajectory prediction. However, the performance of GNNs at binding site identification is still limited potentially due to the lack of dedicated nodes that model hidden geometric entities, such as binding pockets. In this work, we extend E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) by adding virtual nodes and applying an extended message passing scheme. The virtual nodes in these graphs are dedicated quantities to learn representations of binding sites, which leads to improved predictive performance. In our experiments, we show that our proposed method VN-EGNN sets a new state-of-the-art at locating binding site centers on COACH420, HOLO4K and PDBbind2020.</p></details> |  |

In GNN-based CV tasks, a combination of CNN layers and GNN layers or only GNN layers are employed. This paper introduces GCV-Turbo, a domain-specific accelerator on FPGA for end-to-end acceleration of GNN-based CV tasks. GCV-Turbo consists of two key components: (1) a \emph{novel} hardware architecture optimized for the computation kernels in both CNNs and GNNs using the same set of computation resources. (2) a PyTorch-compatible compiler that takes a user-defined model as input, performs end-to-end optimization for the computation graph of a given GNN-based CV task, and produces optimized code for hardware execution. The hardware architecture and the compiler work synergistically to support a variety of GNN-based CV tasks. We implement GCV-Turbo on a state-of-the-art FPGA and evaluate its performance across six representative GNN-based CV tasks with diverse input data modalities (e.g., image, human skeleton, point cloud). Compared with state-of-the-art CPU (GPU) implementations, GCV-Turbo achieves an average latency reduction of $68.4\times$ ($4.1\times$) on these six GNN-based CV tasks. Moreover, GCV-Turbo supports the execution of the standalone CNNs or GNNs, achieving performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art CNN (GNN) accelerators for widely used CNN-only (GNN-only) models.</p></details> |  |

However, bridging the modality gap between graph structures and text remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods like linearizing graphs for PLMs lose vital graph connectivity, whereas Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require cumbersome processes for integration into PLMs. In this work, we propose a novel graph-guided self-attention mechanism, GraSAME. GraSAME seamlessly incorporates token-level structural information into PLMs without necessitating additional alignment or concatenation efforts. As an end-to-end, lightweight multimodal module, GraSAME follows a multi-task learning strategy and effectively bridges the gap between graph and textual modalities, facilitating dynamic interactions between GNNs and PLMs. Our experiments on the graph-to-text generation task demonstrate that GraSAME outperforms baseline models and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on WebNLG datasets. Furthermore, compared to SOTA models, GraSAME eliminates the need for extra pre-training tasks to adjust graph inputs and reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 100 million.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 Findings |
| **[NFARec: A Negative Feedback-Aware Recommender Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06900v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN)-based models have been extensively studied for recommendations, as they can extract high-order collaborative signals accurately which is required for high-quality recommender systems. However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating. In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback. To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations. Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process. The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines.

Recent work on graph neural networks (GNNs) or debiasing methods has attained remarkable gains. However, they still suffer from (1) over-smoothing node embeddings caused by recursive convolutions with GNNs, and (2) the skewed distribution of interactions due to popularity and user-individual biases. This paper proposes a contextualized and debiased recommender model (CaDRec). To overcome the over-smoothing issue, we explore a novel hypergraph convolution operator that can select effective neighbors during convolution by introducing both structural context and sequential context. To tackle the skewed distribution, we propose two strategies for disentangling interactions: (1) modeling individual biases to learn unbiased item embeddings, and (2) incorporating item popularity with positional encoding. Moreover, we mathematically show that the imbalance of the gradients to update item embeddings exacerbates the popularity bias, thus adopting regularization and weighting schemes as solutions. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the CaDRec against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/CaDRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Universal Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15240v5)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has sparked a research surge in adapting pre-trained models. Unlike the unified pre-training strategy employed in the language field, the graph field exhibits diverse pre-training strategies, posing challenges in designing appropriate prompt-based tuning methods for graph neural networks. While some pioneering work has devised specialized prompting functions for models that employ edge prediction as their pre-training tasks, these methods are limited to specific pre-trained GNN models and lack broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce a universal prompt-based tuning method called Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for pre-trained GNN models under any pre-training strategy. GPF operates on the input graph's feature space and can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect to any form of prompting function. Consequently, we no longer need to illustrate the prompting function corresponding to each pre-training strategy explicitly. Instead, we employ GPF to obtain the prompted graph for the downstream task in an adaptive manner. We provide rigorous derivations to demonstrate the universality of GPF and make guarantee of its effectiveness. The experimental results under various pre-training strategies indicate that our method performs better than fine-tuning, with an average improvement of about 1.4% in full-shot scenarios and about 3.2% in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms existing specialized prompt-based tuning methods when applied to models utilizing the pre-training strategy they specialize in. These numerous advantages position our method as a compelling alternative to fine-tuning for downstream adaptations.</p></details> |  |

We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using a surrogate loss. The GNN outputs a heat map representing the probability for each edge to be part of the optimal path. We then apply local search to generate our final prediction based on the heat map. Our loss function consists of two parts: one pushes the model to find the shortest path and the other serves as a surrogate for the constraint that the route should form a Hamiltonian Cycle. Experimental results show that UTSP outperforms the existing data-driven TSP heuristics. Our approach is parameter efficient as well as data efficient: the model takes $\sim$ 10\% of the number of parameters and $\sim$ 0.2\% of training samples compared with reinforcement learning or supervised learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 Camera-ready version fix typos in appendix</p></details> |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with tail entity scoring achieve the state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning. However, the theoretical understandings for these GNNs are either lacking or focusing on single-relational graphs, leaving what the kind of rules these GNNs can learn an open problem. We propose to fill the above gap in this paper. Specifically, GNNs with tail entity scoring are unified into a common framework. Then, we analyze their expressivity by formally describing the rule structures they can learn and theoretically demonstrating their superiority. These results further inspire us to propose a novel labeling strategy to learn more rules in KG reasoning. Experimental results are consistent with our theoretical findings and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Recent semi-supervised semantic segmentation approaches mainly resort to pseudo-labeling methods to exploit unlabeled data. However, unreliable pseudo-labeling can undermine the semi-supervision processes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Multi-Level Label Correction (MLLC), which aims to use graph neural networks to capture structural relationships in Semantic-Level Graphs (SLGs) and Class-Level Graphs (CLGs) to rectify erroneous pseudo-labels. Specifically, SLGs represent semantic affinities between pairs of pixel features, and CLGs describe classification consistencies between pairs of pixel labels. With the support of proximate pattern information from graphs, MLLC can rectify incorrectly predicted pseudo-labels and can facilitate discriminative feature representations. We design an end-to-end network to train and perform this effective label corrections mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that MLLC can significantly improve supervised baselines and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in different scenarios on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets. Specifically, MLLC improves the supervised baseline by at least 5% and 2% with DeepLabV2 and DeepLabV3+ respectively under different partition protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Towards Better Graph Neural Neural Network-based Fault Localization Through Enhanced Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04496v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software fault localization plays an important role in software quality assurance by pinpointing faulty locations for easier debugging. Coverage-based fault localization, a widely used technique, employs statistics on coverage spectra to rank code based on suspiciousness scores. However, the rigidity of statistical approaches calls for learning-based techniques. Amongst all, Grace, a graph-neural network (GNN) based technique has achieved state-of-the-art due to its capacity to preserve coverage spectra, i.e., test-to-source coverage relationships, as precise abstract syntax-enhanced graph representation, mitigating the limitation of other learning-based technique which compresses the feature representation. However, such representation struggles with scalability due to the increasing complexity of software and associated coverage spectra and AST graphs. In this work, we proposed a new graph representation, DepGraph, that reduces the complexity of the graph representation by 70% in nodes and edges by integrating interprocedural call graph in the graph representation of the code. Moreover, we integrate additional features such as code change information in the graph as attributes so the model can leverage rich historical project data. We evaluate DepGraph using Defects4j 2.0.0, and it outperforms Grace by locating 20% more faults in Top-1 and improving the Mean First Rank (MFR) and the Mean Average Rank (MAR) by over 50% while decreasing GPU memory usage by 44% and training/inference time by 85%. Additionally, in cross-project settings, DepGraph surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline with a 42% higher Top-1 accuracy, and 68% and 65% improvement in MFR and MAR, respectively. Our study demonstrates DepGraph's robustness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability for future extension and adoption.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, assuming a multiple-view system composed of several regular RGB cameras, 3D multi-pose estimation presents several challenges. First of all, each person must be uniquely identified in the different views to separate the 2D information provided by the cameras. Secondly, the 3D pose estimation process from the multi-view 2D information of each person must be robust against noise and potential occlusions in the scenario. In this work, we address these two challenges with the help of deep learning. Specifically, we present a model based on Graph Neural Networks capable of predicting the cross-view correspondence of the people in the scenario along with a Multilayer Perceptron that takes the 2D points to yield the 3D poses of each person. These two models are trained in a self-supervised manner, thus avoiding the need for large datasets with 3D annotations.</p></details> |  |

Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, it is not possible to guarantee that just a low-level control policy can resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of large language models (LLMs), this paper explores the possibility of using LLMs for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where an LLM resolves deadlocks by assigning a leader and direction for the leader to move along. A graph neural network (GNN) based low-level distributed control policy executes the assigned plan. We systematically study various prompting techniques to improve LLM's performance in resolving deadlocks. In particular, as part of prompt engineering, we provide in-context examples for LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments on various multi-robot environments with up to 15 agents and 40 obstacles. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based high-level planners are effective in resolving deadlocks in MRS.</p></details> |  |

We investigate a variational framework with support Oracle for compressed sensing sparse reconstructions, where the available measurements are nonlinear and possibly corrupted by noise. A graph neural network, named Oracle-Net, is proposed to predict the support from the nonlinear measurements and is integrated into a regularized recovery model to enforce sparsity. The derived nonsmooth optimization problem is then efficiently solved through a constrained proximal gradient method. Error bounds on the approximate solution of the proposed Oracle-based optimization are provided in the context of the ill-posed Electrical Impedance Tomography problem. Numerical solutions of the EIT nonlinear inverse reconstruction problem confirm the potential of the proposed method which improves the reconstruction quality from undersampled measurements, under sparsity assumptions.</p></details> |  |

Yet, to date, no model with polynomial complexity is known to be complete, that is, able to distinguish between any pair of non-isomorphic point clouds. We fill this theoretical gap by showing that point clouds can be completely determined, up to permutation and rigid motion, by applying the 3-WL graph isomorphism test to the point cloud's centralized Gram matrix. Moreover, we formulate an Euclidean variant of the 2-WL test and show that it is also sufficient to achieve completeness. We then show how our complete Euclidean WL tests can be simulated by an Euclidean graph neural network of moderate size and demonstrate their separation capability on highly symmetrical point clouds.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Learning a probability distribution of energy configuration or finding the ground states of a disordered, fully connected Ising model is essential for statistical mechanics and NP-hard problems. Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural networks. Considering these extremely difficult problems to be solved, our method extends the current computational limits of unsupervised neural networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |

Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction.

Doing so, however, has always used a recurrent architecture, where each iteration of the GNN aligns with an algorithm's iteration. Since an algorithm's solution is often an equilibrium, we conjecture and empirically validate that one can train a network to solve algorithmic problems by directly finding the equilibrium. Note that this does not require matching each GNN iteration with a step of the algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Dynamics Modeling with Hierarchical Point Cloud-based Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06044v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling object dynamics with a neural network is an important problem with numerous applications. Most recent work has been based on graph neural networks. However, physics happens in 3D space, where geometric information potentially plays an important role in modeling physical phenomena. In this work, we propose a novel U-net architecture based on continuous point convolution which naturally embeds information from 3D coordinates and allows for multi-scale feature representations with established downsampling and upsampling procedures. Bottleneck layers in the downsampled point clouds lead to better long-range interaction modeling. Besides, the flexibility of point convolutions allows our approach to generalize to sparsely sampled points from mesh vertices and dynamically generate features on important interaction points on mesh faces. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art, especially in scenarios that require accurate gravity or collision reasoning.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[Hector: An Efficient Programming and Compilation Framework for Implementing Relational Graph Neural Networks in GPU Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06284v3)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational graph neural networks (RGNNs) are graph neural networks with dedicated structures for modeling the different types of nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs. While RGNNs have been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications due to their versatility and accuracy, they pose performance and system design challenges: inherent memory-intensive computation patterns, the gap between the programming interface and kernel APIs, and heavy programming effort in optimizing kernels caused by their coupling with data layout and heterogeneity. To systematically address these challenges, we propose Hector, a novel two-level intermediate representation and its code generator framework, that (a) captures the key properties of RGNN models, and opportunities to reduce memory accesses in inter-operator scheduling and materialization, (b) generates code with flexible data access scheme to eliminate redundant data copies, (c) decouples model semantics, data layout, and operators-specific optimization from each other to reduce programming effort. By building on one general matrix multiply (GEMM) template and a node/edge traversal template, Hector achieves up to 9.9x speed-up in inference and 43.7x speed-up in training compared with the state-of-the-art public systems on select models, i.e., RGCN, RGAT and HGT, when running heterogeneous graphs provided by Deep Graph Library (DGL) and Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). In addition, Hector does not trigger any out-of-memory (OOM) exception in these tests. We also propose the linear operator reorder and compact materialization to further accelerate the system by up to 3.8x. As an indicator of programming effort reduction, Hector takes in 51 lines of code expressing the three models and generates a total of 8K lines of CUDA and C++ code.</p></details> | Accepted by ASPLOS |

However, in the post-pandemic era, the shared mobility sector is grappling with a crisis of trust, particularly concerning passenger hesistancy towards shared transportation options. To address these problems, in this paper we take social network into consideration and propose a novel carpooling matching framework based on graph neural network and reinforcement learning,increasing the carpooling rate to 48% and reducing the average delay time to 6.1 minutes and average detour distance to 2.8km. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative metric, termed 'tolerance' for mobility scheduling models to effectively quantify users' sensitivity to social distancing. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that our model offers a viable approach to amplify the benefits, delivering resilient strategies for the advancement and proliferation of shared mobility incentives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid and Precise Topological Comparison with Merge Tree Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05879v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Merge trees are a valuable tool in scientific visualization of scalar fields; however, current methods for merge tree comparisons are computationally expensive, primarily due to the exhaustive matching between tree nodes. To address this challenge, we introduce the merge tree neural networks (MTNN), a learned neural network model designed for merge tree comparison. The MTNN enables rapid and high-quality similarity computation. We first demonstrate how graph neural networks (GNNs), which emerged as an effective encoder for graphs, can be trained to produce embeddings of merge trees in vector spaces that enable efficient similarity comparison. Next, we formulate the novel MTNN model that further improves the similarity comparisons by integrating the tree and node embeddings with a new topological attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real-world data in different domains and examine our model's generalizability across various datasets. Our experimental analysis demonstrates our approach's superiority in accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we speed up the prior state-of-the-art by more than 100x on the benchmark datasets while maintaining an error rate below 0.1%.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Automated Design and Deployment on Device-Edge Co-Inference Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05605v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key to device-edge co-inference paradigm is to partition models into computation-friendly and computation-intensive parts across the device and the edge, respectively. However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we find that simply partitioning without altering their structures can hardly achieve the full potential of the co-inference paradigm due to various computational-communication overheads of GNN operations over heterogeneous devices. We present GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN that innovatively Co-designs the architecture search and the mapping of each operation on Device-Edge hierarchies. GCoDE abstracts the device communication process into an explicit operation and fuses the search of architecture and the operations mapping in a unified space for joint-optimization. Also, the performance-awareness approach, utilized in the constraint-based search process of GCoDE, enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency in diverse heterogeneous systems. We implement the co-inference engine and runtime dispatcher in GCoDE to enhance the deployment efficiency. Experimental results show that GCoDE can achieve up to $44.9\times$ speedup and $98.2\%$ energy reduction compared to existing approaches across various applications and system configurations.</p></details> | Accepted by DAC'24 |

However, incorporating graph inductive bias into transformer architectures remains a significant challenge. In this report, we propose the Graph Spectral Token, a novel approach to directly encode graph spectral information, which captures the global structure of the graph, into the transformer architecture. By parameterizing the auxiliary [CLS] token and leaving other tokens representing graph nodes, our method seamlessly integrates spectral information into the learning process. We benchmark the effectiveness of our approach by enhancing two existing graph transformers, GraphTrans and SubFormer. The improved GraphTrans, dubbed GraphTrans-Spec, achieves over 10% improvements on large graph benchmark datasets while maintaining efficiency comparable to MP-GNNs. SubFormer-Spec demonstrates strong performance across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Back to the Future: GNN-based NO$_2$ Forecasting via Future Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05324v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the latest environmental concerns in keeping at bay contaminants emissions in urban areas, air pollution forecasting has been rising the forefront of all researchers around the world. When predicting pollutant concentrations, it is common to include the effects of environmental factors that influence these concentrations within an extended period, like traffic, meteorological conditions and geographical information. Most of the existing approaches exploit this information as past covariates, i.e., past exogenous variables that affected the pollutant but were not affected by it. In this paper, we present a novel forecasting methodology to predict NO$_2$ concentration via both past and future covariates. Future covariates are represented by weather forecasts and future calendar events, which are already known at prediction time. In particular, we deal with air quality observations in a city-wide network of ground monitoring stations, modeling the data structure and estimating the predictions with a Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN). We propose a conditioning block that embeds past and future covariates into the current observations. After extracting meaningful spatiotemporal representations, these are fused together and projected into the forecasting horizon to generate the final prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that future covariates are included in time series predictions in a structured way. Remarkably, we find that conditioning on future weather information has a greater impact than considering past traffic conditions. We release our code implementation at https://github.com/polimi-ispl/MAGCRN.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted at IEEE-IGARSS 2024</p></details> |
| **[GeoT: Tensor Centric Library for Graph Neural Network via Efficient Segment Reduction on GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03019v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have ignited a surge of innovation, significantly enhancing the processing of geometric data structures such as graphs, point clouds, and meshes. As the domain continues to evolve, a series of frameworks and libraries are being developed to push GNN efficiency to new heights. While graph-centric libraries have achieved success in the past, the advent of efficient tensor compilers has highlighted the urgent need for tensor-centric libraries. Yet, efficient tensor-centric frameworks for GNNs remain scarce due to unique challenges and limitations encountered when implementing segment reduction in GNN contexts. We introduce GeoT, a cutting-edge tensor-centric library designed specifically for GNNs via efficient segment reduction. GeoT debuts innovative parallel algorithms that not only introduce new design principles but also expand the available design space. Importantly, GeoT is engineered for straightforward fusion within a computation graph, ensuring compatibility with contemporary tensor-centric machine learning frameworks and compilers. Setting a new performance benchmark, GeoT marks a considerable advancement by showcasing an average operator speedup of 1.80x and an end-to-end speedup of 1.68x.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCGEC: One-class Graph Embedding Classification for DNN Backdoor Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01585v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found vulnerable to backdoor attacks, raising security concerns about their deployment in mission-critical applications. There are various approaches to detect backdoor attacks, however they all make certain assumptions about the target attack to be detected and require equal and huge numbers of clean and backdoor samples for training, which renders these detection methods quite limiting in real-world circumstances. This study proposes a novel one-class classification framework called One-class Graph Embedding Classification (OCGEC) that uses GNNs for model-level backdoor detection with only a little amount of clean data. First, we train thousands of tiny models as raw datasets from a small number of clean datasets. Following that, we design a ingenious model-to-graph method for converting the model's structural details and weight features into graph data. We then pre-train a generative self-supervised graph autoencoder (GAE) to better learn the features of benign models in order to detect backdoor models without knowing the attack strategy. After that, we dynamically combine the GAE and one-class classifier optimization goals to form classification boundaries that distinguish backdoor models from benign models. Our OCGEC combines the powerful representation capabilities of graph neural networks with the utility of one-class classification techniques in the field of anomaly detection. In comparison to other baselines, it achieves AUC scores of more than 98% on a number of tasks, which far exceeds existing methods for detection even when they rely on a huge number of positive and negative samples. Our pioneering application of graphic scenarios for generic backdoor detection can provide new insights that can be used to improve other backdoor defense tasks.

| **[Temporal Generalization Estimation in Evolving Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04969v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely deployed in vast fields, but they often struggle to maintain accurate representations as graphs evolve. We theoretically establish a lower bound, proving that under mild conditions, representation distortion inevitably occurs over time. To estimate the temporal distortion without human annotation after deployment, one naive approach is to pre-train a recurrent model (e.g., RNN) before deployment and use this model afterwards, but the estimation is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the representation distortion from an information theory perspective, and attribute it primarily to inaccurate feature extraction during evolution. Consequently, we introduce Smart, a straightforward and effective baseline enhanced by an adaptive feature extractor through self-supervised graph reconstruction. In synthetic random graphs, we further refine the former lower bound to show the inevitable distortion over time and empirically observe that Smart achieves good estimation performance. Moreover, we observe that Smart consistently shows outstanding generalization estimation on four real-world evolving graphs. The ablation studies underscore the necessity of graph reconstruction. For example, on OGB-arXiv dataset, the estimation metric MAPE deteriorates from 2.19% to 8.00% without reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Theoretically, although MARL has the advantages of low computational complexity and fast convergence rate, there exist several challenges including partial observability, non-stationary, and scalability. In this article, we investigate a novel MARL with graph neural network-aided communication (GNNComm-MARL) to address the aforementioned challenges by making use of graph attention networks to effectively sample neighborhoods and selectively aggregate messages. Furthermore, we thoroughly study the architecture of GNNComm-MARL and present a systematic design solution. We then present the typical applications of GNNComm-MARL from two aspects: resource allocation and mobility management. The results obtained unveil that GNNComm-MARL can achieve better performance with lower communication overhead compared to conventional communication schemes. Finally, several important research directions regarding GNNComm-MARL are presented to facilitate further investigation.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing the sensitivity of BP problems, we are able to frame the solution of BP problems as a heterophilic node classification task. We then propose Binary-Programming GNN (BPGNN), an architecture that integrates graph representation learning techniques with BP-aware features to approximate BP solutions efficiently. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised data generation mechanism, to enable efficient and tractable training data acquisition even for large-scale BP problems. Experimental evaluations of BPGNN across diverse BP problem sizes showcase its superior performance compared to exhaustive search and heuristic approaches. Finally, we discuss open challenges in the under-explored field of BP problems with GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, the irregular memory access pattern of HGNNs leads to the buffer thrashing issue in HGNN accelerators. In this work, we identify an opportunity to address buffer thrashing in HGNN acceleration through an analysis of the topology of heterogeneous graphs. To harvest this opportunity, we propose a graph restructuring method and map it into a hardware frontend named GDR-HGNN. GDR-HGNN dynamically restructures the graph on the fly to enhance data locality for HGNN accelerators. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the assistance of GDR-HGNN, a leading HGNN accelerator achieves an average speedup of 14.6 times and 1.78 times compared to the state-of-the-art software framework running on A100 GPU and itself, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, accepted by DAC'61</p></details> |

However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomial-expressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on $13$ homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04612v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a more effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on large heterophilic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Graph Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06716v3)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Graphs widely exist in the real world, which carry complicated spatial and temporal feature patterns, challenging their representation learning. Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have shown impressive predictive abilities by exploiting the intrinsic dynamics. However, DGNNs exhibit limited robustness, prone to adversarial attacks. This paper presents the novel Dynamic Graph Information Bottleneck (DGIB) framework to learn robust and discriminative representations. Leveraged by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, we first propose the expected optimal representations should satisfy the Minimal-Sufficient-Consensual (MSC) Condition. To compress redundant as well as conserve meritorious information into latent representation, DGIB iteratively directs and refines the structural and feature information flow passing through graph snapshots. To meet the MSC Condition, we decompose the overall IB objectives into DGIB$_{MS}$ and DGIB$_C$, in which the DGIB$_{MS}$ channel aims to learn the minimal and sufficient representations, with the DGIB$_{MS}$ channel guarantees the predictive consensus. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the superior robustness of DGIB against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art baselines in the link prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, DGIB is the first work to learn robust representations of dynamic graphs grounded in the information-theoretic IB principle.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the research tracks of The Web Conference 2024 (WWW 2024)</p></details> |
