| **[SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-Based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate   Time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15360v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

| **[Multi-resolution Time-Series Transformer for Long-term Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04147v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of transformers for time-series forecasting has improved significantly. Recent architectures learn complex temporal patterns by segmenting a time-series into patches and using the patches as tokens. The patch size controls the ability of transformers to learn the temporal patterns at different frequencies: shorter patches are effective for learning localized, high-frequency patterns, whereas mining long-term seasonalities and trends requires longer patches. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-resolution Time-Series Transformer (MTST), which consists of a multi-branch architecture for simultaneous modeling of diverse temporal patterns at different resolutions. In contrast to many existing time-series transformers, we employ relative positional encoding, which is better suited for extracting periodic components at different scales. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MTST in comparison to state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[A data-informed mathematical model of microglial cell dynamics during   ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15284v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuroinflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery. During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two different phenotypes: M1, which can worsen brain injury; or M2, which can aid in long-term recovery. In this study, we contribute a summary of experimental data on microglial cell counts in the penumbra following ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and compile available data sets into a single set suitable for time series analysis. Further, we formulate a mathematical model of microglial cells in the penumbra during ischemic stroke due to MCAO. Through use of global sensitivity analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based parameter estimation, we analyze the effects of the model parameters on the number of M1 and M2 cells in the penumbra and fit identifiable parameters to the compiled experimental data set. We utilize results from MCMC parameter estimation to ascertain uncertainty bounds and forward predictions for the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells over time. Results demonstrate the significance of parameters related to M1 and M2 activation on the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells. Simulations further suggest that potential outliers in the observed data may be omitted and forecast predictions suggest a lingering inflammatory response.</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Embed Time Series Patches Independently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16427v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked time series modeling has recently gained much attention as a self-supervised representation learning strategy for time series. Inspired by masked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and partially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the dependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked patches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be an optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning to embed patches independently results in better time series representations. Specifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which autoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple patch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce complementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time series information efficiently. Our proposed method improves time series forecasting and classification performance compared to state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, while it is more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and training/inference time.

| **[Soft Contrastive Learning for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16424v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has shown to be effective to learn representations from time series in a self-supervised way. However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Improved Long Short-Term Memory-based Wastewater Treatment Simulators   for Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15091v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) showed outstanding results in the fields of Robotics and Games, it is still challenging to implement it in the optimization of industrial processes like wastewater treatment. One of the challenges is the lack of a simulation environment that will represent the actual plant as accurately as possible to train DRL policies. Stochasticity and non-linearity of wastewater treatment data lead to unstable and incorrect predictions of models over long time horizons. One possible reason for the models' incorrect simulation behavior can be related to the issue of compounding error, which is the accumulation of errors throughout the simulation. The compounding error occurs because the model utilizes its predictions as inputs at each time step. The error between the actual data and the prediction accumulates as the simulation continues. We implemented two methods to improve the trained models for wastewater treatment data, which resulted in more accurate simulators: 1- Using the model's prediction data as input in the training step as a tool of correction, and 2- Change in the loss function to consider the long-term predicted shape (dynamics). The experimental results showed that implementing these methods can improve the behavior of simulators in terms of Dynamic Time Warping throughout a year up to 98% compared to the base model. These improvements demonstrate significant promise in creating simulators for biological processes that do not need pre-existing knowledge of the process but instead depend exclusively on time series data obtained from the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grey-informed neural network for time-series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15027v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network models have shown outstanding performance and successful resolutions to complex problems in various fields. However, the majority of these models are viewed as black-box, requiring a significant amount of data for development. Consequently, in situations with limited data, constructing appropriate models becomes challenging due to the lack of transparency and scarcity of data. To tackle these challenges, this study suggests the implementation of a grey-informed neural network (GINN). The GINN ensures that the output of the neural network follows the differential equation model of the grey system, improving interpretability. Moreover, incorporating prior knowledge from grey system theory enables traditional neural networks to effectively handle small data samples. Our proposed model has been observed to uncover underlying patterns in the real world and produce reliable forecasts based on empirical data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Concept Shift in Online Time Series Forecasting:   Detect-then-Adapt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14949v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online updating of time series forecasting models aims to tackle the challenge of concept drifting by adjusting forecasting models based on streaming data. While numerous algorithms have been developed, most of them focus on model design and updating. In practice, many of these methods struggle with continuous performance regression in the face of accumulated concept drifts over time. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach, Concept \textbf{D}rift \textbf{D}etection an\textbf{D} \textbf{A}daptation (D3A), that first detects drifting conception and then aggressively adapts the current model to the drifted concepts after the detection for rapid adaption. To best harness the utility of historical data for model adaptation, we propose a data augmentation strategy introducing Gaussian noise into existing training instances. It helps mitigate the data distribution gap, a critical factor contributing to train-test performance inconsistency. The significance of our data augmentation process is verified by our theoretical analysis. Our empirical studies across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of D3A in improving model adaptation capability. Notably, compared to a simple Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline, D3A reduces the average Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $43.9\%$. For the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the MSE is reduced by $33.3\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 fig...</summary><p>7 figures, 14 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with   arXiv:2309.12659</p></details> |
| **[Local and Global Trend Bayesian Exponential Smoothing Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13950v3)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes a family of seasonal and non-seasonal time series models that can be viewed as generalisations of additive and multiplicative exponential smoothing models, to model series that grow faster than linear but slower than exponential. Their development is motivated by fast-growing, volatile time series. In particular, our models have a global trend that can smoothly change from additive to multiplicative, and is combined with a linear local trend. Seasonality when used is multiplicative in our models, and the error is always additive but is heteroscedastic and can grow through a parameter sigma. We leverage state-of-the-art Bayesian fitting techniques to accurately fit these models that are more complex and flexible than standard exponential smoothing models. When applied to the M3 competition data set, our models outperform the best algorithms in the competition as well as other benchmarks, thus achieving to the best of our knowledge the best results of per-series univariate methods on this dataset in the literature. An open-source software package of our method is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Clustering Using DBSCAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14798v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economic policy and research rely on the correct evaluation of the billions of high-frequency data points that we collect every day. Consistent clustering algorithms, like DBSCAN, allow us to make sense of the data in a useful way. However, while there is a large literature on the consistency of various clustering algorithms for high-dimensional static clustering, the literature on multivariate time series clustering still largely relies on heuristics or restrictive assumptions. The aim of this paper is to prove a notion of consistency of DBSCAN for the task of clustering multivariate time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14587v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their simplicity, linear models perform well at time series forecasting, even when pitted against deeper and more expensive models. A number of variations to the linear model have been proposed, often including some form of feature normalisation that improves model generalisation. In this paper we analyse the sets of functions expressible using these linear model architectures. In so doing we show that several popular variants of linear models for time series forecasting are equivalent and functionally indistinguishable from standard, unconstrained linear regression. We characterise the model classes for each linear variant. We demonstrate that each model can be reinterpreted as unconstrained linear regression over a suitably augmented feature set, and therefore admit closed-form solutions when using a mean-squared loss function. We provide experimental evidence that the models under inspection learn nearly identical solutions, and finally demonstrate that the simpler closed form solutions are superior forecasters across 72% of test settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Physical Information Consistency of Channel Data Augmentation   for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14547v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of data augmentation for deep learning (DL) methods plays an important role in achieving state-of-the-art results in supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised image classification. In particular, channel transformations (e.g., solarize, grayscale, brightness adjustments) are integrated into data augmentation pipelines for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks. However, contradicting beliefs exist about their proper applications to RS images. A common point of critique is that the application of channel augmentation techniques may lead to physically inconsistent spectral data (i.e., pixel signatures). To shed light on the open debate, we propose an approach to estimate whether a channel augmentation technique affects the physical information of RS images. To this end, the proposed approach estimates a score that measures the alignment of a pixel signature within a time series that can be naturally subject to deviations caused by factors such as acquisition conditions or phenological states of vegetation. We compare the scores associated with original and augmented pixel signatures to evaluate the physical consistency. Experimental results on a multi-label image classification task show that channel augmentations yielding a score that exceeds the expected deviation of original pixel signatures can not improve the performance of a baseline model trained without augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing   Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Let's do the time-warp-attend: Learning topological invariants of   dynamical systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09234v3)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems across the sciences, from electrical circuits to ecological networks, undergo qualitative and often catastrophic changes in behavior, called bifurcations, when their underlying parameters cross a threshold. Existing methods predict oncoming catastrophes in individual systems but are primarily time-series-based and struggle both to categorize qualitative dynamical regimes across diverse systems and to generalize to real data. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven, physically-informed deep-learning framework for classifying dynamical regimes and characterizing bifurcation boundaries based on the extraction of topologically invariant features. We focus on the paradigmatic case of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is used to model periodic dynamics across a wide range of applications. Our convolutional attention method is trained with data augmentations that encourage the learning of topological invariants which can be used to detect bifurcation boundaries in unseen systems and to design models of biological systems like oscillatory gene regulatory networks. We further demonstrate our method's use in analyzing real data by recovering distinct proliferation and differentiation dynamics along pancreatic endocrinogenesis trajectory in gene expression space based on single-cell data. Our method provides valuable insights into the qualitative, long-term behavior of a wide range of dynamical systems, and can detect bifurcations or catastrophic transitions in large-scale physical and biological systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phenology curve estimation via a mixed model representation of   functional principal components: Characterizing time series of   satellite-derived vegetation indices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14451v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vegetation phenology consists of studying synchronous stationary events, such as the vegetation green up and leaves senescence, that can be construed as adaptive responses to climatic constraints. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the annual phenology curve from multi-annual observations of time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite images. We fitted the classical harmonic regression model to annual-based time series in order to construe the original data set as realizations of a functional process. Hierarchical clustering was applied to define a nearly homogeneous group of annual (smoothed) time series from which a representative and idealized phenology curve was estimated at the pixel level. This curve resulted from fitting a mixed model, based on functional principal components, to the homogeneous group of time series. Leveraging the idealized phenology curve, we employed standard calculus criteria to estimate the following phenological parameters (stationary events): green up, start of season, maturity, senescence, end of season and dormancy. By applying the proposed methodology to four different data cubes (time series from 2000 to 2023 of a popular satellite-derived vegetation index) recorded across grasslands, forests, and annual rainfed agricultural zones of a Flora and Fauna Protected Area in northern Mexico, we verified that our approach characterizes properly the phenological cycle in vegetation with nearly periodic dynamics, such as grasslands and agricultural areas. The R package sephora was used for all computations in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[HySim: An Efficient Hybrid Similarity Measure for Patch Matching in   Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14292v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inpainting, for filling missing image regions, is a crucial task in various applications, such as medical imaging and remote sensing. Trending data-driven approaches efficiency, for image inpainting, often requires extensive data preprocessing. In this sense, there is still a need for model-driven approaches in case of application constrained with data availability and quality, especially for those related for time series forecasting using image inpainting techniques. This paper proposes an improved modeldriven approach relying on patch-based techniques. Our approach deviates from the standard Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) similarity measure by introducing a Hybrid Similarity (HySim), which combines both strengths of Chebychev and Minkowski distances. This hybridization enhances patch selection, leading to high-quality inpainting results with reduced mismatch errors. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of our approach against other model-driven techniques, such as diffusion or patch-based approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving visually pleasing restorations.</p></details> |  |
