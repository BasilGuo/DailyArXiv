| **[Anomalous Change Point Detection Using Probabilistic Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15727v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change point detection (CPD) and anomaly detection (AD) are essential techniques in various fields to identify abrupt changes or abnormal data instances. However, existing methods are often constrained to univariate data, face scalability challenges with large datasets due to computational demands, and experience reduced performance with high-dimensional or intricate data, as well as hidden anomalies. Furthermore, they often lack interpretability and adaptability to domain-specific knowledge, which limits their versatility across different fields. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based CPD/AD method called Probabilistic Predictive Coding (PPC) that jointly learns to encode sequential data to low dimensional latent space representations and to predict the subsequent data representations as well as the corresponding prediction uncertainties. The model parameters are optimized with maximum likelihood estimation by comparing these predictions with the true encodings. At the time of application, the true and predicted encodings are used to determine the probability of conformity, an interpretable and meaningful anomaly score. Furthermore, our approach has linear time complexity, scalability issues are prevented, and the method can easily be adjusted to a wide range of data types and intricate applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed method across synthetic time series experiments, image data, and real-world magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Machine Learning</p></details> |

| **[Delving into the Trajectory Long-tail Distribution for Muti-object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04700v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical area within computer vision, with a broad spectrum of practical implementations. Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance. The code is available at https://github.com/chen-si-jia/Trajectory-Long-tail-Distribution-for-MOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024!</p></details> |
| **[Language-Driven Interactive Traffic Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15388v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic trajectory generation with natural language control is pivotal for advancing autonomous vehicle technology. However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands. Our code is available at https://github.com/X1a-jk/InteractTraj.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for Model Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drones Help Drones: A Collaborative Framework for Multi-Drone Object Trajectory Prediction and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14674v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative trajectory prediction can comprehensively forecast the future motion of objects through multi-view complementary information. However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Trajectory Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification with Conditioned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14384v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces the conditioned Vehicle Motion Diffusion (cVMD) model, a novel network architecture for highway trajectory prediction using diffusion models. The proposed model ensures the drivability of the predicted trajectory by integrating non-holonomic motion constraints and physical constraints into the generative prediction module. Central to the architecture of cVMD is its capacity to perform uncertainty quantification, a feature that is crucial in safety-critical applications. By integrating the quantified uncertainty into the prediction process, the cVMD's trajectory prediction performance is improved considerably. The model's performance was evaluated using the publicly available highD dataset. Experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves competitive trajectory prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, while providing guaranteed drivable trajectories and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference Workshops (CVPRW) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Whole Body Trajectory Planning for Mobile Manipulators in Planetary Exploration and Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14363v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Space robotics poses unique challenges arising from the limitation of energy and computational resources, and the complexity of the environment and employed platforms. At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Volatility for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14039v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data deviating from the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption of in-distribution training data poses security threats to deep networks, thus advancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms. Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Safe and Personalizable Logical Guidance for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13704v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles necessitate a delicate balance between safety, efficiency, and user preferences in trajectory planning. Existing traditional or learning-based methods face challenges in adequately addressing all these aspects. In response, this paper proposes a novel component termed the Logical Guidance Layer (LGL), designed for seamless integration into autonomous driving trajectory planning frameworks, specifically tailored for highway scenarios. The LGL guides the trajectory planning with a local target area determined through scenario reasoning, scenario evaluation, and guidance area calculation. Integrating the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, the LGL ensures formal safety guarantees while accommodating various user preferences defined by logical formulae. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the LGL in achieving a balance between safety and efficiency, and meeting user preferences in autonomous highway driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ITSC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Camera Trajectory Control with Enhanced Immersion for Virtual Cinematography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17041v3)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-generated cinematic creations are gaining popularity as our daily entertainment, yet it is a challenge to master cinematography for producing immersive contents. Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Methods for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |
| **[PLM4Traj: Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories play a vital role in various spatio-temporal data mining tasks. Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

| **[Hacking Predictors Means Hacking Cars: Using Sensitivity Analysis to Identify Trajectory Prediction Vulnerabilities for Autonomous Driving Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10313v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks on learning-based multi-modal trajectory predictors have already been demonstrated. However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Perception Without Vision for Trajectory Prediction: Ego Vehicle Dynamics as Scene Representation for Efficient Active Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09049v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the use of trajectory and dynamic state information for efficient data curation in autonomous driving machine learning tasks. We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Clustering Functional Trajectories over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11358v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional concurrent, or varying-coefficient, regression models are commonly used in biomedical and clinical settings to investigate how the relation between an outcome and observed covariate varies as a function of another covariate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |

Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, a terrestrial-aerial path-searching method with the crawling limitation of HyFCQs is proposed to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of trajectories. Additionally, a trajectory tracking method is proposed to address the challenges associated with the deformation time required by HyFCQs, which makes tracking hybrid trajectories at the junction between terrestrial and aerial segments difficult. Simulations and real-world experiments in diverse scenarios validate the exceptional performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Creating Geospatial Trajectories from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06130v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trafficking is a crime that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we propose a high-performance method for privacy-preserving matrix completion. First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

| **[A Weighted Least-Squares Method for Non-Asymptotic Identification of Markov Parameters from Multiple Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04258v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov parameters play a key role in system identification. There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach models all driving scenario elements in a unified model: the position of new agents, their initial state, and their future motion trajectories. By predicting the distributions of all these variables from a shared global scenario embedding, we ensure that the final generated scenario is fully conditioned on all available context in the existing scene. Our unified modeling approach, combined with autoregressive agent injection, conditions the placement and motion trajectory of every new agent on all existing agents and their trajectories, leading to realistic scenarios with low collision rates. Our experimental results show that UniGen outperforms prior state of the art on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[LightTR: A Lightweight Framework for Federated Trajectory Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03409v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of GPS-equipped edge devices, huge trajectory data is generated and accumulated in various domains, motivating a variety of urban applications. Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unscented Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02753v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans. This performance underscores the model's unparalleled adaptability and efficacy in navigating complex traffic scenarios, including highways, urban streets, and intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/G2LTraj.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01658v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

Considering node classification task, based on the i.i.d assumption among node labels, the traditional supervised learning simply sums up cross-entropy losses of the independent training nodes and applies the average loss to optimize GNNs' weights. But different from other data formats, the nodes are naturally connected. It is found that the independent distribution modeling of node labels restricts GNNs' capability to generalize over the entire graph and defend adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a new framework, termed joint-cluster supervised learning, to model the joint distribution of each node with its corresponding cluster. We learn the joint distribution of node and cluster labels conditioned on their representations, and train GNNs with the obtained joint loss. In this way, the data-label reference signals extracted from the local cluster explicitly strengthen the discrimination ability on the target node. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our joint-cluster supervised learning can effectively bolster GNNs' node classification accuracy. Furthermore, being benefited from the reference signals which may be free from spiteful interference, our learning paradigm significantly protects the node classification from being affected by the adversarial attack.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

The main recipe for solving them is iterative solvers with well-designed preconditioners. Deep learning models may be used to precondition residuals during iteration of such linear solvers as the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Neural network models require an enormous number of parameters to approximate well in this setup. Another approach is to take advantage of small graph neural networks (GNNs) to construct preconditioners of the predefined sparsity pattern. In our work, we recall well-established preconditioners from linear algebra and use them as a starting point for training the GNN. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms both classical methods and neural network-based preconditioning. We also provide a heuristic justification for the loss function used and validate our approach on complex datasets.</p></details> |  |

With the large-scale deployment of both non-terrestrial and terrestrial networks, limited spectrum resources will not be allocated enough. Consequently, dynamic spectrum sharing is crucial for their coexistence in the same spectrum, where accurate spectrum sensing is essential. However, spectrum sensing in space is more challenging than in terrestrial networks due to variable channel conditions, making single-satellite sensing unstable. Therefore, we first attempt to design a collaborative sensing scheme utilizing diverse data from multiple satellites. However, it is non-trivial to achieve this collaboration due to heterogeneous channel quality, considerable raw sampling data, and packet loss. To address the above challenges, we first establish connections between the satellites by modeling their sensing data as a graph and devising a graph neural network-based algorithm to achieve effective spectrum sensing. Meanwhile, we establish a joint sub-Nyquist sampling and autoencoder data compression framework to reduce the amount of transmitted sensing data. Finally, we propose a contrastive learning-based mechanism compensates for missing packets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed strategy can achieve efficient spectrum sensing performance and outperform the conventional deep learning algorithm in spectrum sensing accuracy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |

Existing methods predominantly construct social networks as graph and utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) for bot detection. However, most of these methods focus on how to improve the performance of GNNs while neglecting the community structure within social networks. Moreover, GNNs based methods still face problems such as poor model generalization due to the relatively small scale of the dataset and over-smoothness caused by information propagation mechanism. To address these problems, we propose a Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CACL), which constructs social network as heterogeneous graph with multiple node types and edge types, and then utilizes community-aware module to dynamically mine both hard positive samples and hard negative samples for supervised graph contrastive learning with adaptive graph enhancement algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework addresses the previously mentioned challenges and outperforms competitive baselines on three social media bot benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 findings</p></details> |

However, handling collisions and intersections in neural simulations remains a largely unsolved problem. In this work, we present \moniker{}, a learning-based solution for handling intersections in neural cloth simulations. Unlike conventional approaches that critically rely on intersection-free inputs, \moniker{} robustly recovers from intersections introduced through missed collisions, self-penetrating bodies, or errors in manually designed multi-layer outfits. The technical core of \moniker{} is a novel intersection contour loss that penalizes interpenetrations and encourages rapid resolution thereof. We integrate our intersection loss with a collision-avoiding repulsion objective into a neural cloth simulation method based on graph neural networks (GNNs). We demonstrate our method's ability across a challenging set of diverse multi-layer outfits under dynamic human motions. Our extensive analysis indicates that \moniker{} significantly improves collision handling for learned simulation and produces visually compelling results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by SIGGRAPH 2024, conference track</p></details> |

Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[DFGNN: Dual-frequency Graph Neural Network for Sign-aware Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15280v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph-based recommendation has achieved great success in recent years. However, most existing graph-based recommendations focus on capturing user preference based on positive edges/feedback, while ignoring negative edges/feedback (e.g., dislike, low rating) that widely exist in real-world recommender systems. How to utilize negative feedback in graph-based recommendations still remains underexplored. In this study, we first conducted a comprehensive experimental analysis and found that (1) existing graph neural networks are not well-suited for modeling negative feedback, which acts as a high-frequency signal in a user-item graph. (2) The graph-based recommendation suffers from the representation degeneration problem. Based on the two observations, we propose a novel model that models positive and negative feedback from a frequency filter perspective called Dual-frequency Graph Neural Network for Sign-aware Recommendation (DFGNN). Specifically, in DFGNN, the designed dual-frequency graph filter (DGF) captures both low-frequency and high-frequency signals that contain positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, the proposed signed graph regularization is applied to maintain the user/item embedding uniform in the embedding space to alleviate the representation degeneration problem. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Codes of our model will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2024 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Cardinality Estimation on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15231v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardinality Estimation (CE) for query is to estimate the number of results without execution, which is an effective index in query optimization. Recently, CE over has achieved great success in knowledge graphs (KGs) that consist of triple facts. To more precisely represent facts, current researchers propose hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) to represent a triple fact with qualifiers, where qualifiers provide additional context to the fact. However, existing CE methods over KGs achieve unsatisfying performance on HKGs due to the complexity of qualifiers in HKGs. Also, there is only one dataset for HKG query cardinality estimation, i.e., WD50K-QE, which is not comprehensive and only covers limited patterns. The lack of querysets over HKG also becomes a bottleneck to comprehensively investigate CE problems on HKGs. In this work, we first construct diverse and unbiased hyper-relational querysets over three popular HKGs for investigating CE. Besides, we also propose a novel qualifier-attached graph neural network (GNN) model that effectively incorporates qualifier information and adaptively combines outputs from multiple GNN layers, to accurately predict the cardinality. Our experiments illustrate that the proposed hyper-relational query encoder outperforms all state-of-the-art CE methods over three popular HKGs on the diverse and unbiased benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGS-GNN: Attribute-guided Sampling for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15218v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose AGS-GNN, a novel attribute-guided sampling algorithm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that exploits node features and connectivity structure of a graph while simultaneously adapting for both homophily and heterophily in graphs. (In homophilic graphs vertices of the same class are more likely to be connected, and vertices of different classes tend to be linked in heterophilic graphs.) While GNNs have been successfully applied to homophilic graphs, their application to heterophilic graphs remains challenging. The best-performing GNNs for heterophilic graphs do not fit the sampling paradigm, suffer high computational costs, and are not inductive. We employ samplers based on feature-similarity and feature-diversity to select subsets of neighbors for a node, and adaptively capture information from homophilic and heterophilic neighborhoods using dual channels. Currently, AGS-GNN is the only algorithm that we know of that explicitly controls homophily in the sampled subgraph through similar and diverse neighborhood samples. For diverse neighborhood sampling, we employ submodularity, which was not used in this context prior to our work. The sampling distribution is pre-computed and highly parallel, achieving the desired scalability. Using an extensive dataset consisting of 35 small ($\le$ 100K nodes) and large (>100K nodes) homophilic and heterophilic graphs, we demonstrate the superiority of AGS-GNN compare to the current approaches in the literature. AGS-GNN achieves comparable test accuracy to the best-performing heterophilic GNNs, even outperforming methods using the entire graph for node classification. AGS-GNN also converges faster compared to methods that sample neighborhoods randomly, and can be incorporated into existing GNN models that employ node or graph sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to KDD'24 in the research track</p></details> |

Machine Learning (ML) has recently been key in advancing HT research. Various novel techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown HT insertion and detection capabilities. HT insertion with ML techniques, specifically, has seen a spike in research activity due to the shortcomings of conventional HT benchmarks and the inherent human design bias that occurs when we create them. This work continues this innovation by presenting a tool called "TrojanForge", capable of generating HT adversarial examples that defeat HT detectors; demonstrating the capabilities of GAN-like adversarial tools for automatic HT insertion. We introduce an RL environment where the RL insertion agent interacts with HT detectors in an insertion-detection loop where the agent collects rewards based on its success in bypassing HT detectors. Our results show that this process leads to inserted HTs that evade various HT detectors, achieving high attack success percentages. This tool provides insight into why HT insertion fails in some instances and how we can leverage this knowledge in defense.</p></details> |  |

In a changing climate, expanding the use of prescribed fires is widely considered to be the most robust fire mitigation strategy. However, reliably forecasting the potential air quality impact from prescribed fires, which is critical in planning the prescribed fires' location and time, at hourly to daily time scales remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) based forecasting model for hourly PM$_{2.5}$ predictions across California. Using a two-step approach, we leverage our forecasting model to estimate the PM$_{2.5}$ contribution of wildfires. Integrating the GNN-based PM$_{2.5}$ forecasting model with prescribed fire simulations, we propose a novel framework to forecast the PM$_{2.5}$ pollution of prescribed fires. This framework helps determine March as the optimal month for implementing prescribed fires in California and quantifies the potential air quality trade-offs involved in conducting more prescribed fires outside the fire season.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; multiple figures; matches version submitted to Environmental Data Science</p></details> |

We show how to use these logics to measure the expressiveness of classes of GNNs, in some cases getting exact correspondences between the expressiveness of logics and GNNs. We also employ the logics, and the techniques used to analyze them, to obtain decision procedures for verification problems over GNNs. We complement this with undecidability results for static analysis problems involving the logics, as well as for GNN verification problems.</p></details> |  |

Point sets with small discrepancy are called low-discrepancy and are known to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. Low-discrepancy points play a central role in many problems in science and engineering, including numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. In this work, we present the first machine learning approach to generate a new class of low-discrepancy point sets named Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) points. Motivated by the geometric nature of generating low-discrepancy point sets, we leverage tools from Geometric Deep Learning and base our model on Graph Neural Networks. We further provide an extension of our framework to higher dimensions, which flexibly allows the generation of custom-made points that emphasize the uniformity in specific dimensions that are primarily important for the particular problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance superior to previous methods by a significant margin. In fact, MPMC points are empirically shown to be either optimal or near-optimal with respect to the discrepancy for every dimension and the number of points for which the optimal discrepancy can be determined.</p></details> |  |

This study examines how atom-level pretraining with quantum mechanics (QM) data can mitigate violations of assumptions regarding the distributional similarity between training and test data and therefore improve performance and generalization in downstream tasks. In the public dataset Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), we show how pretraining on atom-level QM improves performance overall and makes the activation of the features distributes more Gaussian-like which results in a representation that is more robust to distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hidden state molecular representations are analyzed to compare the effects of molecule-level and atom-level pretraining on QM data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages + 10 Supplement Materials</p></details> |

Nonetheless, it remains challenging to transfer the success of these architectures to relational hypergraphs, where the task of link prediction is over $k$-ary relations, which is substantially harder than link prediction with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a framework for link prediction with relational hypergraphs, unlocking applications of graph neural networks to fully relational structures. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough analysis of the expressive power of the resulting model architectures via corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms and also via logical expressiveness. Empirically, we validate the power of the proposed model architectures on various relational hypergraph benchmarks. The resulting model architectures substantially outperform every baseline for inductive link prediction, and lead to state-of-the-art results for transductive link prediction.</p></details> |  |

This strong convergence phenomenon applies to a very wide class of GNNs, including state of the art models, with aggregates including mean and the attention-based mechanism of graph transformers. Our results apply to a broad class of random graph models, including sparse and dense variants of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, the stochastic block model, and the Barab\'asi-Albert model. We empirically validate these findings, observing that the convergence phenomenon appears not only on random graphs but also on some real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 bod...</summary><p>9 body pages, 28 appendix pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the data-driven description of lattice materials mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20056v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the emerging field of mechanical metamaterials, using periodic lattice structures as a primary ingredient is relatively frequent. However, the choice of aperiodic lattices in these structures presents unique advantages regarding failure, e.g., buckling or fracture, because avoiding repeated patterns prevents global failures, with local failures occurring in turn that can beneficially delay structural collapse. Therefore, it is expedient to develop models for computing efficiently the effective mechanical properties in lattices from different general features while addressing the challenge of presenting topologies (or graphs) of different sizes. In this paper, we develop a deep learning model to predict energetically-equivalent mechanical properties of linear elastic lattices effectively. Considering the lattice as a graph and defining material and geometrical features on such, we show that Graph Neural Networks provide more accurate predictions than a dense, fully connected strategy, thanks to the geometrically induced bias through graph representation, closer to the underlying equilibrium laws from mechanics solved in the direct problem. Leveraging the efficient forward-evaluation of a vast number of lattices using this surrogate enables the inverse problem, i.e., to obtain a structure having prescribed specific behavior, which is ultimately suitable for multiscale structural optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the advent of dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) marks a significant advancement due to their superior capability in learning from dynamic graphs, which encapsulate spatial-temporal variations in diverse real-world applications (e.g., traffic forecasting). With the increasing prevalence of DGNNs, it becomes imperative to investigate the implementation of dynamic graph unlearning. However, current graph unlearning methodologies are designed for GNNs operating on static graphs and exhibit limitations including their serving in a pre-processing manner and impractical resource demands. Furthermore, the adaptation of these methods to DGNNs presents non-trivial challenges, owing to the distinctive nature of dynamic graphs. To this end, we propose an effective, efficient, model-agnostic, and post-processing method to implement DGNN unlearning. Specifically, we first define the unlearning requests and formulate dynamic graph unlearning in the context of continuous-time dynamic graphs. After conducting a role analysis on the unlearning data, the remaining data, and the target DGNN model, we propose a method called Gradient Transformation and a loss function to map the unlearning request to the desired parameter update. Evaluations on six real-world datasets and state-of-the-art DGNN backbones demonstrate its effectiveness (e.g., limited performance drop even obvious improvement) and efficiency (e.g., at most 7.23$\times$ speed-up) outperformance, and potential advantages in handling future unlearning requests (e.g., at most 32.59$\times$ speed-up).</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Graph Neural Networks via Structure-aware Interaction Index](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14352v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Shapley value is a prominent tool for interpreting black-box machine learning models thanks to its strong theoretical foundation. However, for models with structured inputs, such as graph neural networks, existing Shapley-based explainability approaches either focus solely on node-wise importance or neglect the graph structure when perturbing the input instance. This paper introduces the Myerson-Taylor interaction index that internalizes the graph structure into attributing the node values and the interaction values among nodes. Unlike the Shapley-based methods, the Myerson-Taylor index decomposes coalitions into components satisfying a pre-chosen connectivity criterion. We prove that the Myerson-Taylor index is the unique one that satisfies a system of five natural axioms accounting for graph structure and high-order interaction among nodes. Leveraging these properties, we propose Myerson-Taylor Structure-Aware Graph Explainer (MAGE), a novel explainer that uses the second-order Myerson-Taylor index to identify the most important motifs influencing the model prediction, both positively and negatively. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets and models demonstrate that our method consistently provides superior subgraph explanations compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, ICML'24 |

In response, a new wave of methods, collectively known as GNN-to-MLP Knowledge Distillation, has emerged. They aim to transfer GNN-learned knowledge to a more efficient MLP student, which offers faster, resource-efficient inference while maintaining competitive performance compared to GNNs. However, these methods face significant challenges in situations with insufficient training data and incomplete test data, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose AdaGMLP, an AdaBoosting GNN-to-MLP Knowledge Distillation framework. It leverages an ensemble of diverse MLP students trained on different subsets of labeled nodes, addressing the issue of insufficient training data. Additionally, it incorporates a Node Alignment technique for robust predictions on test data with missing or incomplete features. Our experiments on seven benchmark datasets with different settings demonstrate that AdaGMLP outperforms existing G2M methods, making it suitable for a wide range of latency-sensitive real-world applications. We have submitted our code to the GitHub repository (https://github.com/WeigangLu/AdaGMLP-KDD24).</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Similarity-Navigated Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14303v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in semi-supervised node classification tasks. However, these results lack reliable uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction methods provide a theoretical guarantee for node classification tasks, ensuring that the conformal prediction set contains the ground-truth label with a desired probability (e.g., 95%). In this paper, we empirically show that for each node, aggregating the non-conformity scores of nodes with the same label can improve the efficiency of conformal prediction sets. This observation motivates us to propose a novel algorithm named Similarity-Navigated Adaptive Prediction Sets (SNAPS), which aggregates the non-conformity scores based on feature similarity and structural neighborhood. The key idea behind SNAPS is that nodes with high feature similarity or direct connections tend to have the same label. By incorporating adaptive similar nodes information, SNAPS can generate compact prediction sets and increase the singleton hit ratio (correct prediction sets of size one). Moreover, we theoretically provide a finite-sample coverage guarantee of SNAPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SNAPS, improving the efficiency of prediction sets and singleton hit ratio while maintaining valid coverage.</p></details> |  |

Graphcodes handle datasets that are filtered along two real-valued scale parameters. Such multi-parameter topological summaries are usually based on complicated theoretical foundations and difficult to compute; in contrast, graphcodes yield an informative and interpretable summary and can be computed as efficient as one-parameter summaries. Moreover, a graphcode is simply an embedded graph and can therefore be readily integrated in machine learning pipelines using graph neural networks. We describe such a pipeline and demonstrate that graphcodes achieve better classification accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Sparsification via Mixture of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14260v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance across various graph learning tasks but face significant computational challenges when applied to large-scale graphs. One effective approach to mitigate these challenges is graph sparsification, which involves removing non-essential edges to reduce computational overhead. However, previous graph sparsification methods often rely on a single global sparsity setting and uniform pruning criteria, failing to provide customized sparsification schemes for each node's complex local context. In this paper, we introduce Mixture-of-Graphs (MoG), leveraging the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), to dynamically select tailored pruning solutions for each node. Specifically, MoG incorporates multiple sparsifier experts, each characterized by unique sparsity levels and pruning criteria, and selects the appropriate experts for each node. Subsequently, MoG performs a mixture of the sparse graphs produced by different experts on the Grassmann manifold to derive an optimal sparse graph. One notable property of MoG is its entirely local nature, as it depends on the specific circumstances of each individual node. Extensive experiments on four large-scale OGB datasets and two superpixel datasets, equipped with five GNN backbones, demonstrate that MoG (I) identifies subgraphs at higher sparsity levels ($8.67\%\sim 50.85\%$), with performance equal to or better than the dense graph, (II) achieves $1.47-2.62\times$ speedup in GNN inference with negligible performance drop, and (III) boosts ``top-student'' GNN performance ($1.02\%\uparrow$ on RevGNN+\textsc{ogbn-proteins} and $1.74\%\uparrow$ on DeeperGCN+\textsc{ogbg-ppa}).</p></details> |  |

These models demand extensive memory and computational resources but challenge modeling hierarchical structures of subgraphs. In this paper, we propose Subgraph-To-Node (S2N) translation, a novel formulation for learning representations of subgraphs. Specifically, given a set of subgraphs in the global graph, we construct a new graph by coarsely transforming subgraphs into nodes. Demonstrating both theoretical and empirical evidence, S2N not only significantly reduces memory and computational costs compared to state-of-the-art models but also outperforms them by capturing both local and global structures of the subgraph. By leveraging graph coarsening methods, our method outperforms baselines even in a data-scarce setting with insufficient subgraphs. Our experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate that fined-tuned models with S2N translation can process 183 -- 711 times more subgraph samples than state-of-the-art models at a better or similar performance level.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 Camera Ready (22 pages)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks with Diverse Spectral Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09041v3)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph machine learning, with polynomial filters applied for graph convolutions, where all nodes share the identical filter weights to mine their local contexts. Despite the success, existing spectral GNNs usually fail to deal with complex networks (e.g., WWW) due to such homogeneous spectral filtering setting that ignores the regional heterogeneity as typically seen in real-world networks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel diverse spectral filtering (DSF) framework, which automatically learns node-specific filter weights to exploit the varying local structure properly. Particularly, the diverse filter weights consist of two components -- A global one shared among all nodes, and a local one that varies along network edges to reflect node difference arising from distinct graph parts -- to balance between local and global information. As such, not only can the global graph characteristics be captured, but also the diverse local patterns can be mined with awareness of different node positions. Interestingly, we formulate a novel optimization problem to assist in learning diverse filters, which also enables us to enhance any spectral GNNs with our DSF framework. We showcase the proposed framework on three state-of-the-arts including GPR-GNN, BernNet, and JacobiConv. Extensive experiments over 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently boost model performance by up to 4.92% in node classification tasks, producing diverse filters with enhanced interpretability.

| **[Automated Loss function Search for Class-imbalanced Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14133v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-imbalanced node classification tasks are prevalent in real-world scenarios. Due to the uneven distribution of nodes across different classes, learning high-quality node representations remains a challenging endeavor. The engineering of loss functions has shown promising potential in addressing this issue. It involves the meticulous design of loss functions, utilizing information about the quantities of nodes in different categories and the network's topology to learn unbiased node representations. However, the design of these loss functions heavily relies on human expert knowledge and exhibits limited adaptability to specific target tasks. In this paper, we introduce a high-performance, flexible, and generalizable automated loss function search framework to tackle this challenge. Across 15 combinations of graph neural networks and datasets, our framework achieves a significant improvement in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observe that homophily in graph-structured data significantly contributes to the transferability of the proposed framework.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Spatially Adaptive Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09071v4)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we investigate the theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency among nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Algorithm for Node Feature Forecasting in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16800v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an online algorithm mspace for forecasting node features in temporal graphs, which captures spatial cross-correlation among different nodes as well as the temporal auto-correlation within a node. The algorithm can be used for both probabilistic and deterministic multi-step forecasting, making it applicable for estimation and generation tasks. Comparative evaluations against various baselines, including temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models and classical Kalman filters, demonstrate that mspace performs at par with the state-of-the-art and even surpasses them on some datasets. Importantly, mspace demonstrates consistent performance across datasets with varying training sizes, a notable advantage over TGNN models that require abundant training samples to effectively learn the spatiotemporal trends in the data. Therefore, employing mspace is advantageous in scenarios where the training sample availability is limited. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on multi-step forecasting error of mspace and show that it scales linearly with the number of forecast steps $q$ as $\mathcal{O}(q)$. For an asymptotically large number of nodes $n$, and timesteps $T$, the computational complexity of mspace grows linearly with both $n$, and $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nT)$, while its space complexity remains constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We compare the performance of various mspace variants against ten recent TGNN baselines and two classical baselines, ARIMA and the Kalman filter across ten real-world datasets. Additionally, we propose a technique to generate synthetic datasets to aid in evaluating node feature forecasting methods, with the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research. Lastly, we have investigate the interpretability of different mspace variants by analyzing model parameters alongside dataset characteristics to derive model and data-centric insights.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Shape-aware Graph Spectral Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10064v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are gaining attention for their ability to surpass the limitations of message-passing GNNs. They rely on supervision from downstream tasks to learn spectral filters that capture the graph signal's useful frequency information. However, some works empirically show that the preferred graph frequency is related to the graph homophily level. This relationship between graph frequency and graphs with homophily/heterophily has not been systematically analyzed and considered in existing spectral GNNs. To mitigate this gap, we conduct theoretical and empirical analyses revealing a positive correlation between low-frequency importance and the homophily ratio, and a negative correlation between high-frequency importance and the homophily ratio. Motivated by this, we propose shape-aware regularization on a Newton Interpolation-based spectral filter that can (i) learn an arbitrary polynomial spectral filter and (ii) incorporate prior knowledge about the desired shape of the corresponding homophily level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NewtonNet can achieve graph spectral filters with desired shapes and superior performance on both homophilous and heterophilous datasets.</p></details> |  |

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we aim to streamline the GNN design process and leverage the advantages of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the performance of GNNs on downstream tasks. We formulate a new paradigm, coined "LLMs-as-Consultants," which integrates LLMs with GNNs in an interactive manner. A framework named LOGIN (LLM Consulted GNN training) is instantiated, empowering the interactive utilization of LLMs within the GNN training process. First, we attentively craft concise prompts for spotted nodes, carrying comprehensive semantic and topological information, and serving as input to LLMs. Second, we refine GNNs by devising a complementary coping mechanism that utilizes the responses from LLMs, depending on their correctness. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of LOGIN on node classification tasks across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. The results illustrate that even basic GNN architectures, when employed within the proposed LLMs-as-Consultants paradigm, can achieve comparable performance to advanced GNNs with intricate designs.

| **[Rethinking and Accelerating Graph Condensation: A Training-Free Approach with Class Partition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13707v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs poses a significant challenge for graph neural network training, attributed to their substantial computational requirements. In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a promising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a small yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization processes, necessitating excessive computing resources. In this paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues: 1. various GC optimization strategies converge to class-level node feature matching between the original and condensed graphs, making the optimization target coarse-grained despite the complex computations; 2. to bridge the original and condensed graphs, existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the node feature matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel class-to-node paradigm. Remarkably, this refinement also simplifies the GC optimization as a class partition problem, which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features, eliminating the back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC achieves state-of-the-art performance with a more efficient condensation process. For instance, compared with the seminal GC method (i.e., GCond), CGC condenses the largest Reddit graph within 10 seconds, achieving a 2,680X speedup and a 1.4% accuracy increase.</p></details> |  |

Many methods that perform well on automatic facial action unit (AU) detection primarily focus on modeling various types of AU relations between corresponding local muscle areas, or simply mining global attention-aware facial features, however, neglect the dynamic interactions among local-global features. We argue that encoding AU features just from one perspective may not capture the rich contextual information between regional and global face features, as well as the detailed variability across AUs, because of the diversity in expression and individual characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level Graph Relational Reasoning Network (termed MGRR-Net) for facial AU detection. Each layer of MGRR-Net performs a multi-level (i.e., region-level, pixel-wise and channel-wise level) feature learning. While the region-level feature learning from local face patches features via graph neural network can encode the correlation across different AUs, the pixel-wise and channel-wise feature learning via graph attention network can enhance the discrimination ability of AU features from global face features. The fused features from the three levels lead to improved AU discriminative ability. Extensive experiments on DISFA and BP4D AU datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables;</p></details> |

In this report, we explore the idea that leverages information-enriched features extracted from network flow packet data to improve the performance of GNN in anomaly detection. The idea is to utilize feature encoding (binary, numerical, and string) to capture the relationships between the network components, allowing the GNN to learn latent relationships and better identify anomalies.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems. It provides an unified framework for any multi-physics informed AI with a graph encoder readable for any deep learning model.

Users are increasingly interested in a better understanding of GNN models and their outcomes. Unfortunately, today's evaluation frameworks for GNN explainability often rely on few inadequate synthetic datasets, leading to conclusions of limited scope due to a lack of complexity in the problem instances. As GNN models are deployed to more mission-critical applications, we are in dire need for a common evaluation protocol of explainability methods of GNNs. In this paper, we propose, to our best knowledge, the first systematic evaluation framework for GNN explainability, considering explainability on three different "user needs". We propose a unique metric that combines the fidelity measures and classifies explanations based on their quality of being sufficient or necessary. We scope ourselves to node classification tasks and compare the most representative techniques in the field of input-level explainability for GNNs. For the inadequate but widely used synthetic benchmarks, surprisingly shallow techniques such as personalized PageRank have the best performance for a minimum computation time. But when the graph structure is more complex and nodes have meaningful features, gradient-based methods are the best according to our evaluation criteria. However, none dominates the others on all evaluation dimensions and there is always a trade-off. We further apply our evaluation protocol in a case study for frauds explanation on eBay transaction graphs to reflect the production environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Learning on Graphs 2022 (LoG2022) and New Frontiers in Graph Learning Workshop (Neurips 2022)</p></details> |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This success has prompted several studies to explore the representational capability of GNNs based on the graph isomorphism task. These works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few theoretical works study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. This paper presents a novel perspective on the representational capability of GNNs across all levels - node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level - when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, it relaxes the injective requirement in previous works by employing an implicit pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function. This allows distinct inputs to produce similar outputs only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation, which is often useful in practice. As a consequence, a novel soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes non-linear and contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations is proposed. A mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and widely used GNNs is then laid out to put the contribution in context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Equivariant graph neural networks are a standard approach to such problems, with one of the most successful methods employing tensor products between various tensors that transform under the spatial group. However, as the number of different tensors and the complexity of relationships between them increase, maintaining parsimony and equivariance becomes increasingly challenging. In this paper, we propose using fusion diagrams, a technique widely employed in simulating SU($2$)-symmetric quantum many-body problems, to design new equivariant components for equivariant neural networks. This results in a diagrammatic approach to constructing novel neural network architectures. When applied to particles within a given local neighborhood, the resulting components, which we term "fusion blocks," serve as universal approximators of any continuous equivariant function defined in the neighborhood. We incorporate a fusion block into pre-existing equivariant architectures (Cormorant and MACE), leading to improved performance with fewer parameters on a range of challenging chemical problems. Furthermore, we apply group-equivariant neural networks to study non-adiabatic molecular dynamics of stilbene cis-trans isomerization. Our approach, which combines tensor networks with equivariant neural networks, suggests a potentially fruitful direction for designing more expressive equivariant neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages + 12-page supplementary materials, many figures</p></details> |

The data from such collision events can naturally be represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis, greatly motivate the development of alternative fast and efficient computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, one can leverage the fundamental symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and equivariant layers. In this paper, we perform a fair and comprehensive comparison between classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their AUC scores, the quantum networks were shown to outperform the classical networks. However, seeing the computational advantage of the quantum networks in practice may have to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 3 appendices</p></details> |

Typically, GNNs are constructed by incorporating alternating layers which learn transformations of graph node features, along with graph pooling layers that use graph pooling operators (e.g., Max-pooling) to effectively reduce the number of nodes while preserving the semantic information of the graph. Recently, to enhance GNNs in graph learning tasks, Manifold-Mixup, a data augmentation technique that produces synthetic graph data by linearly mixing a pair of graph data and their labels, has been widely adopted. However, the performance of Manifold-Mixup can be highly affected by graph pooling operators, and there have not been many studies that are dedicated to uncovering such affection. To bridge this gap, we take an early step to explore how graph pooling operators affect the performance of Mixup-based graph learning. To that end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study by applying Manifold-Mixup to a formal characterization of graph pooling based on 11 graph pooling operations (9 hybrid pooling operators, 2 non-hybrid pooling operators). The experimental results on both natural language datasets (Gossipcop, Politifact) and programming language datasets (JAVA250, Python800) demonstrate that hybrid pooling operators are more effective for Manifold-Mixup than the standard Max-pooling and the state-of-the-art graph multiset transformer (GMT) pooling, in terms of producing more accurate and robust GNN models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Journal of Systems and Software (JSS) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Partial Label Learning with Potential Cause Discovering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11449v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered widespread attention for their potential to address the challenges posed by graph representation learning, which face complex graph-structured data across various domains. However, due to the inherent complexity and interconnectedness of graphs, accurately annotating graph data for training GNNs is extremely challenging. To address this issue, we have introduced Partial Label Learning (PLL) into graph representation learning. PLL is a critical weakly supervised learning problem where each training instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, including the ground-truth label and the additional interfering labels. PLL allows annotators to make errors, which reduces the difficulty of data labeling. Subsequently, we propose a novel graph representation learning method that enables GNN models to effectively learn discriminative information within the context of PLL. Our approach utilizes potential cause extraction to obtain graph data that holds causal relationships with the labels. By conducting auxiliary training based on the extracted graph data, our model can effectively eliminate the interfering information in the PLL scenario. We support the rationale behind our method with a series of theoretical analyses. Moreover, we conduct extensive evaluations and ablation studies on multiple datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Methods for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

We develop a computationally effective approach towards providing robust certificates for message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) using a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. Because our work builds on mixed-integer optimization, it encodes a wide variety of subproblems, for example it admits (i) both adding and removing edges, (ii) both global and local budgets, and (iii) both topological perturbations and feature modifications. Our key technology, topology-based bounds tightening, uses graph structure to tighten bounds. We also experiment with aggressive bounds tightening to dynamically change the optimization constraints by tightening variable bounds. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, we implement an extension to the open-source branch-and-cut solver SCIP. We test on both node and graph classification problems and consider topological attacks that both add and remove edges.</p></details> |  |

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published to the conference of NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

Existing GNN architectures often assume ideal communications and ignore potential channel effects, such as fading and noise, leading to performance degradation in real-world implementation. Considering a GNN implemented over nodes connected through wireless links, this paper conducts a stability analysis to study the impact of channel impairments on the performance of GNNs, and proposes graph neural networks over the air (AirGNNs), a novel GNN architecture that incorporates the communication model. AirGNNs modify graph convolutional operations that shift graph signals over random communication graphs to take into account channel fading and noise when aggregating features from neighbors, thus, improving architecture robustness to channel impairments during testing. We develop a channel-inversion signal transmission strategy for AirGNNs when channel state information (CSI) is available, and propose a stochastic gradient descent based method to train AirGNNs when CSI is unknown. The convergence analysis shows that the training procedure approaches a stationary solution of an associated stochastic optimization problem and the variance analysis characterizes the statistical behavior of the trained model. Experiments on decentralized source localization and multi-robot flocking corroborate theoretical findings and show superior performance of AirGNNs over wireless communication channels.</p></details> |  |

GNN meets LLM for Document-to-Presentation Transformation with Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13095v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating a presentation from the text of a long document is a challenging and useful problem. In contrast to a flat summary, a presentation needs to have a better and non-linear narrative, i.e., the content of a slide can come from different and non-contiguous parts of the given document. However, it is difficult to incorporate such non-linear mapping of content to slides and ensure that the content is faithful to the document. LLMs are prone to hallucination and their performance degrades with the length of the input document. Towards this, we propose a novel graph based solution where we learn a graph from the input document and use a combination of graph neural network and LLM to generate a presentation with attribution of content for each slide. We conduct thorough experiments to show the merit of our approach compared to directly using LLMs for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review in a conference</p></details> |

Existing approaches for rumor detection primarily rely on propagation graphs to enhance model effectiveness. However, the presence of noisy and irrelevant structures during the propagation process limits the efficacy of these approaches. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, these techniques heavily depend on rich original propagation structures, thus hindering performance when dealing with rumors that lack sufficient propagation information in the early propagation stages. In this paper, we propose Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based rumor detection framework that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information, while also identifies indicative substructures for events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG consists of two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns the latent distribution from refined propagation patterns, filtering out noise and generating new candidates for ENS. Simultaneously, ENS identifies the most influential substructures within propagation graphs and generates training data for CRG. Moreover, we introduce an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards to guide the entire training process via a pre-trained graph neural network. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KPG compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph neural networks informed locally by thermodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13093v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermodynamics-informed neural networks employ inductive biases for the enforcement of the first and second principles of thermodynamics. To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.</p></details> |  |

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have remarkable performance in graph representation learning, their extension to hypergraphs encounters challenges due to their intricate structures. Furthermore, current hypergraph transformers, a special variant of GNN, utilize semantic feature-based self-attention, ignoring topological attributes of nodes and hyperedges. To address these challenges, we propose a Topology-guided Hypergraph Transformer Network (THTN). In this model, we first formulate a hypergraph from a graph while retaining its structural essence to learn higher-order relations within the graph. Then, we design a simple yet effective structural and spatial encoding module to incorporate the topological and spatial information of the nodes into their representation. Further, we present a structure-aware self-attention mechanism that discovers the important nodes and hyperedges from both semantic and structural viewpoints. By leveraging these two modules, THTN crafts an improved node representation, capturing both local and global topological expressions. Extensive experiments conducted on node classification tasks demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model consistently exceeds that of the existing approaches.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Existing models usually estimate original citation counts based on static graphs and fail to differentiate values from nuanced perspectives. In this study, we propose a novel graph neural network to Disentangle the Potential impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution values (called DPPDCC). Given a target paper, DPPDCC encodes temporal and structural features within the constructed dynamic heterogeneous graph. Particularly, to capture the knowledge flow, we emphasize the importance of comparative and co-cited/citing information between papers and aggregate snapshots evolutionarily. To unravel popularity, we contrast augmented graphs to extract the essence of diffusion and predict the accumulated citation binning to model conformity. We further apply orthogonal constraints to encourage distinct modeling of each perspective and preserve the inherent value of contribution. To evaluate models' generalization for papers published at various times, we reformulate the problem by partitioning data based on specific time points to mirror real-world conditions. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that DPPDCC significantly outperforms baselines for previously, freshly, and immediately published papers. Further analyses confirm its robust capabilities. We will make our datasets and codes publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update and correct some references.

Current research mainly utilizes subgraphs of the input as local explanations or generates new graphs as global explanations. However, these graph-based methods are limited in their ability to explain classes with multiple sufficient explanations. To provide more expressive explanations, we propose utilizing class expressions (CEs) from the field of description logic (DL). Our approach explains heterogeneous graphs with different types of nodes using CEs in the EL description logic. To identify the best explanation among multiple candidate explanations, we employ and compare two different scoring functions: (1) For a given CE, we construct multiple graphs, have the GNN make a prediction for each graph, and aggregate the predicted scores. (2) We score the CE in terms of fidelity, i.e., we compare the predictions of the GNN to the predictions by the CE on a separate validation set. Instead of subgraph-based explanations, we offer CE-based explanations.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving promising GNN performance, especially on unseen data, requires comprehensive hyperparameter tuning and meticulous training. Unfortunately, these processes come with high computational costs and significant human effort. Additionally, conventional searching algorithms such as grid search may result in overfitting on validation data, diminishing generalization accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose a graph conditional latent diffusion framework (GNN-Diff) to generate high-performing GNNs directly by learning from checkpoints saved during a light-tuning coarse search. Our method: (1) unleashes GNN training from heavy tuning and complex search space design; (2) produces GNN parameters that outperform those obtained through comprehensive grid search; and (3) establishes higher-quality generation for GNNs compared to diffusion frameworks designed for general neural networks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.08419</p></details> |

Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are predefined and remain fixed across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter. It optimizes the convolution and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on a diverse range of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying degrees of heterophily, support the superiority of UniFilter. These results not only demonstrate the universality of UniBasis but also highlight its proficiency in graph explanation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.18177</p></details> |

To bypass eigendecomposition, polynomial graph filters are proposed to approximate graph filters by leveraging various polynomial bases for filter training. However, no existing studies have explored the diverse polynomial graph filters from a unified perspective for optimization. In this paper, we first unify polynomial graph filters, as well as the optimal filters of identical degrees into the Krylov subspace of the same order, thus providing equivalent expressive power theoretically. Next, we investigate the asymptotic convergence property of polynomials from the unified Krylov subspace perspective, revealing their limited adaptability in graphs with varying heterophily degrees. Inspired by those facts, we design a novel adaptive Krylov subspace approach to optimize polynomial bases with provable controllability over the graph spectrum so as to adapt various heterophily graphs. Subsequently, we propose AdaptKry, an optimized polynomial graph filter utilizing bases from the adaptive Krylov subspaces. Meanwhile, in light of the diverse spectral properties of complex graphs, we extend AdaptKry by leveraging multiple adaptive Krylov bases without incurring extra training costs. As a consequence, extended AdaptKry is able to capture the intricate characteristics of graphs and provide insights into their inherent complexity. We conduct extensive experiments across a series of real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior filtering capability of AdaptKry, as well as the optimized efficacy of the adaptive Krylov basis.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |

Especially inductive GNNs, which enable the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are gaining importance in an increasingly wide variety of applications. As these networks demonstrate proficiency across a range of tasks, they become lucrative targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. A large effort has been made to develop model-stealing attacks that focus on models trained with images and texts. However, little attention has been paid to GNNs trained on graph data. This paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, based on graph contrasting learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the target model. The proposed attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets. The results show that this approach demonstrates a higher level of efficiency compared to existing stealing attacks. More concretely, our attack outperforms the baseline on all benchmarks achieving higher fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while requiring fewer queries sent to the target model.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2112.08331 by other authors</p></details> |

Despite their efficacy, a significant drawback of GNNs lies in their limited ability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, posing challenges to their reliability in contexts where errors carry significant consequences. Moreover, GNNs typically excel in in-distribution settings, assuming that training and test data follow identical distributions: a condition often unmet in real-world graph data scenarios. In this article, we leverage conformal prediction, a widely recognized statistical technique for quantifying uncertainty by transforming predictive model outputs into prediction sets, to address uncertainty quantification in GNN predictions amidst conditional shift \footnote{Representing the change in conditional probability distribution $P(label |input)$ from source domain to target domain.} in graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Additionally, we propose a novel loss function aimed at refining model predictions by minimizing conditional shift in latent stages. Termed Conditional Shift Robust (CondSR) conformal prediction for GNNs, our approach CondSR is model-agnostic and adaptable to various classification models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on standard graph benchmark datasets, integrating it with state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification tasks.

LCR holds pivotal significance in facilitating legal practitioners in finding precedents. Most of existing LCR methods are based on traditional lexical models and language models, which have gained promising performance in retrieval. However, the domain-specific structural information inherent in legal documents is yet to be exploited to further improve the performance. Our previous work CaseGNN successfully harnesses text-attributed graphs and graph neural networks to address the problem of legal structural information neglect. Nonetheless, there remain two aspects for further investigation: (1) The underutilization of rich edge information within text-attributed case graphs limits CaseGNN to generate informative case representation. (2) The inadequacy of labelled data in legal datasets hinders the training of CaseGNN model. In this paper, CaseGNN++, which is extended from CaseGNN, is proposed to simultaneously leverage the edge information and additional label data to discover the latent potential of LCR models. Specifically, an edge feature-based graph attention layer (EUGAT) is proposed to comprehensively update node and edge features during graph modelling, resulting in a full utilisation of structural information of legal cases. Moreover, a novel graph contrastive learning objective with graph augmentation is developed in CaseGNN++ to provide additional training signals, thereby enhancing the legal comprehension capabilities of CaseGNN++ model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that CaseGNN++ not only significantly improves CaseGNN but also achieves supreme performance compared to state-of-the-art LCR methods.

Existing acceleration strategies decompose TE optimization into concurrent subproblems but realize limited parallelism due to an inherent tradeoff between run time and allocation performance. We present Teal, a learning-based TE algorithm that leverages the parallel processing power of GPUs to accelerate TE control. First, Teal designs a flow-centric graph neural network (GNN) to capture WAN connectivity and network flows, learning flow features as inputs to downstream allocation. Second, to reduce the problem scale and make learning tractable, Teal employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to independently allocate each traffic demand while optimizing a central TE objective. Finally, Teal fine-tunes allocations with ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), a highly parallelizable optimization algorithm for reducing constraint violations such as overutilized links. We evaluate Teal using traffic matrices from Microsoft's WAN. On a large WAN topology with >1,700 nodes, Teal generates near-optimal flow allocations while running several orders of magnitude faster than the production optimization engine. Compared with other TE acceleration schemes, Teal satisfies 6--32% more traffic demand and yields 197--625x speedups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph Pruning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11531v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of knowledge graph based recommendation system (KGRS), which enriches the representation of users, items, and entities by structural knowledge with striking improvement. Nevertheless, its unaffordable computational cost still limits researchers from exploring more sophisticated models. We observe that the bottleneck for training efficiency arises from the knowledge graph, which is plagued by the well-known issue of knowledge explosion. Recently, some works have attempted to slim the inflated KG via summarization techniques. However, these summarized nodes may ignore the collaborative signals and deviate from the facts that nodes in knowledge graph represent symbolic abstractions of entities from the real-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called KGTrimmer for knowledge graph pruning tailored for recommendation, to remove the unessential nodes while minimizing performance degradation. Specifically, we design an importance evaluator from a dual-view perspective. For the collective view, we embrace the idea of collective intelligence by extracting community consensus based on abundant collaborative signals, i.e. nodes are considered important if they attract attention of numerous users. For the holistic view, we learn a global mask to identify the valueless nodes from their inherent properties or overall popularity. Next, we build an end-to-end importance-aware graph neural network, which injects filtered knowledge to enhance the distillation of valuable user-item collaborative signals. Ultimately, we generate a pruned knowledge graph with lightweight, stable, and robust properties to facilitate the following-up recommendation task. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets to prove the effectiveness and generalization ability of KGTrimmer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Targeted Messages More Effective?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06817v2)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) are deep learning architectures for graphs. Essentially, a GNN is a distributed message passing algorithm, which is controlled by parameters learned from data. It operates on the vertices of a graph: in each iteration, vertices receive a message on each incoming edge, aggregate these messages, and then update their state based on their current state and the aggregated messages. The expressivity of GNNs can be characterised in terms of certain fragments of first-order logic with counting and the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. The core GNN architecture comes in two different versions. In the first version, a message only depends on the state of the source vertex, whereas in the second version it depends on the states of the source and target vertices. In practice, both of these versions are used, but the theory of GNNs so far mostly focused on the first one. On the logical side, the two versions correspond to two fragments of first-order logic with counting that we call modal and guarded. The question whether the two versions differ in their expressivity has been mostly overlooked in the GNN literature and has only been asked recently (Grohe, LICS'23). We answer this question here. It turns out that the answer is not as straightforward as one might expect. By proving that the modal and guarded fragment of first-order logic with counting have the same expressivity over labelled undirected graphs, we show that in a non-uniform setting the two GNN versions have the same expressivity. However, we also prove that in a uniform setting the second version is strictly more expressive.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiGPT: Heterogeneous Graph Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16024v2)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph learning aims to capture complex relationships and diverse relational semantics among entities in a heterogeneous graph to obtain meaningful representations for nodes and edges. Recent advancements in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance by considering relation heterogeneity and using specialized message functions and aggregation rules. However, existing frameworks for heterogeneous graph learning have limitations in generalizing across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets. Most of these frameworks follow the "pre-train" and "fine-tune" paradigm on the same dataset, which restricts their capacity to adapt to new and unseen data. This raises the question: "Can we generalize heterogeneous graph models to be well-adapted to diverse downstream learning tasks with distribution shifts in both node token sets and relation type heterogeneity?'' To tackle those challenges, we propose HiGPT, a general large graph model with Heterogeneous graph instruction-tuning paradigm. Our framework enables learning from arbitrary heterogeneous graphs without the need for any fine-tuning process from downstream datasets. To handle distribution shifts in heterogeneity, we introduce an in-context heterogeneous graph tokenizer that captures semantic relationships in different heterogeneous graphs, facilitating model adaptation. We incorporate a large corpus of heterogeneity-aware graph instructions into our HiGPT, enabling the model to effectively comprehend complex relation heterogeneity and distinguish between various types of graph tokens. Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture-of-Thought (MoT) instruction augmentation paradigm to mitigate data scarcity by generating diverse and informative instructions. Through comprehensive evaluations, our proposed framework demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[Learning Structure-from-Motion with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15984v3)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we tackle the problem of learning Structure-from-Motion (SfM) through the use of graph attention networks. SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors, referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA), starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initialization to BA, conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation, pose averaging or triangulation) which provide an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we replace these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views, and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D keypoint coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specific primitives, and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms competing learning-based methods, and challenges COLMAP while having lower runtime.

Despite their success, however, existing GNNs suffer from two significant limitations: a lack of interpretability in results due to their black-box nature, and an inability to learn representations of varying orders. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{M}odel-\textbf{a}gnostic \textbf{G}raph Neural \textbf{Net}work (MaGNet) framework, which is able to effectively integrate information of various orders, extract knowledge from high-order neighbors, and provide meaningful and interpretable results by identifying influential compact graph structures. In particular, MaGNet consists of two components: an estimation model for the latent representation of complex relationships under graph topology, and an interpretation model that identifies influential nodes, edges, and node features. Theoretically, we establish the generalization error bound for MaGNet via empirical Rademacher complexity, and demonstrate its power to represent layer-wise neighborhood mixing. We conduct comprehensive numerical studies using simulated data to demonstrate the superior performance of MaGNet in comparison to several state-of-the-art alternatives. Furthermore, we apply MaGNet to a real-world case study aimed at extracting task-critical information from brain activity data, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in advancing scientific research.</p></details> |  |

Various texts such as biomedical literature, drug reviews, and user posts on social media and medical forums contain a wealth of information about ADEs. Recent studies have applied word embedding and deep learning -based natural language processing to automate ADE detection from text. However, they did not explore incorporating explicit medical knowledge about drugs and adverse reactions or the corresponding feature learning. This paper adopts the heterogenous text graph which describes relationships between documents, words and concepts, augments it with medical knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System, and proposes a concept-aware attention mechanism which learns features differently for the different types of nodes in the graph. We further utilize contextualized embeddings from pretrained language models and convolutional graph neural networks for effective feature representation and relational learning. Experiments on four public datasets show that our model achieves performance competitive to the recent advances and the concept-aware attention consistently outperforms other attention mechanisms.</p></details> | LREC-COLING 2024 |

This paper designs the optimal task offloading policy to address the concerns involving processing delay, energy consumption and edge computing cost. Each computation task consisting of some interdependent sub-tasks is characterized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In such dynamic networks, a novel hierarchical Offloading scheme is proposed by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inter-dependencies among the DAGs of the computation tasks are extracted using a graph neural network with attention mechanism. A parameterized DRL algorithm is developed to deal with the hierarchical action space containing both discrete and continuous actions. Simulation results with a real-world car speed dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system overhead.</p></details> |  |

To detect such attacks, graph neural network based methods have shown promising results by modeling the system's events as a graph. However, existing methods still face several challenges when deployed in practice. First, there is a lack of sufficient real attack data especially considering the large volume of normal data. Second, the modeling of event graphs is challenging due to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature. Third, the lack of explanation in learning models undermines the trustworthiness of such methods in production environments. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose an attack detection method, Trace2Vec. The approach first designs an erosion function to augment rare attack samples, and integrates them into the event graphs. Next, it models the event graphs via a continuous-time dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network. Finally, it employs the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to identify events with greater contributions to the attack, thus enhancing the explainability of the detection result. We have implemented a prototype for Trace2Vec, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its superior detection and explanation performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author: Peng Gao (gao.itslab@gmail.com)</p></details> |

Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2024 (Research track)</p></details> |
| **[STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12418v4)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeBot: Structural Entropy Guided Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Social Bot Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11225v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in social bot detection have been driven by the adoption of Graph Neural Networks. The social graph, constructed from social network interactions, contains benign and bot accounts that influence each other. However, previous graph-based detection methods that follow the transductive message-passing paradigm may not fully utilize hidden graph information and are vulnerable to adversarial bot behavior. The indiscriminate message passing between nodes from different categories and communities results in excessively homogeneous node representations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of social bot detectors. In this paper, we propose SEBot, a novel multi-view graph-based contrastive learning-enabled social bot detector. In particular, we use structural entropy as an uncertainty metric to optimize the entire graph's structure and subgraph-level granularity, revealing the implicitly existing hierarchical community structure. And we design an encoder to enable message passing beyond the homophily assumption, enhancing robustness to adversarial behaviors of social bots. Finally, we employ multi-view contrastive learning to maximize mutual information between different views and enhance the detection performance through multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of social bot detection compared with SOTA methods.</p></details> | KDD 2024 |

The nucleus of existing GNN-based recommender systems involves recursive message passing along user-item interaction edges to refine encoded embeddings. Despite their demonstrated effectiveness, current GNN-based methods encounter challenges of limited receptive fields and the presence of noisy "interest-irrelevant" connections. In contrast, Transformer-based methods excel in aggregating information adaptively and globally. Nevertheless, their application to large-scale interaction graphs is hindered by inherent complexities and challenges in capturing intricate, entangled structural information. In this paper, we propose TransGNN, a novel model that integrates Transformer and GNN layers in an alternating fashion to mutually enhance their capabilities. Specifically, TransGNN leverages Transformer layers to broaden the receptive field and disentangle information aggregation from edges, which aggregates information from more relevant nodes, thereby enhancing the message passing of GNNs. Additionally, to capture graph structure information effectively, positional encoding is meticulously designed and integrated into GNN layers to encode such structural knowledge into node attributes, thus enhancing the Transformer's performance on graphs. Efficiency considerations are also alleviated by proposing the sampling of the most relevant nodes for the Transformer, along with two efficient sample update strategies to reduce complexity. Furthermore, theoretical analysis demonstrates that TransGNN offers increased expressiveness compared to GNNs, with only a marginal increase in linear complexity. Extensive experiments on five public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TransGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[GraSS: Combining Graph Neural Networks with Expert Knowledge for SAT Solver Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11024v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems are routinely solved by SAT solvers in real-life applications, yet solving time can vary drastically between solvers for the same instance. This has motivated research into machine learning models that can predict, for a given SAT instance, which solver to select among several options. Existing SAT solver selection methods all rely on some hand-picked instance features, which are costly to compute and ignore the structural information in SAT graphs. In this paper we present GraSS, a novel approach for automatic SAT solver selection based on tripartite graph representations of instances and a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) model. While GNNs have been previously adopted in other SAT-related tasks, they do not incorporate any domain-specific knowledge and ignore the runtime variation introduced by different clause orders. We enrich the graph representation with domain-specific decisions, such as novel node feature design, positional encodings for clauses in the graph, a GNN architecture tailored to our tripartite graphs and a runtime-sensitive loss function. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this combination of raw representations and domain-specific choices leads to improvements in runtime for a pool of seven state-of-the-art solvers on both an industrial circuit design benchmark, and on instances from the 20-year Anniversary Track of the 2022 SAT Competition.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Our experiments demonstrate that enriching text-based embeddings of users with network information from the user interaction graph using our semi-supervised GNN method outperforms both classifiers trained on user textual embeddings and zero-shot classification using LLMs such as GPT4. We discuss the need for integrating nuanced understanding from social science with the scalability of computational methods to better understand how polarization on social media occurs for divisive issues such as climate change and gun control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Backdoor Attacks: A Distribution-Preserving Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10757v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks. However, recent works reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Generally, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching backdoor triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. A GNN trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes attached with trigger to the target class. Despite their effectiveness, our empirical analysis shows that triggers generated by existing methods tend to be out-of-distribution (OOD), which significantly differ from the clean data. Hence, these injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned with widely used outlier detection methods in real-world applications. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with in-distribution (ID) triggers. To generate ID triggers, we introduce an OOD detector in conjunction with an adversarial learning strategy to generate the attributes of the triggers within distribution. To ensure a high attack success rate with ID triggers, we introduce novel modules designed to enhance trigger memorization by the victim model trained on poisoned graph. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating in distribution triggers that can by-pass various defense strategies while maintaining a high attack success rate.</p></details> |  |

Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables; its conference version was presented at the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2022)</p></details> |
| **[Hi-GMAE: Hierarchical Graph Masked Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10642v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Masked Autoencoders (GMAEs) have emerged as a notable self-supervised learning approach for graph-structured data. Existing GMAE models primarily focus on reconstructing node-level information, categorizing them as single-scale GMAEs. This methodology, while effective in certain contexts, tends to overlook the complex hierarchical structures inherent in many real-world graphs. For instance, molecular graphs exhibit a clear hierarchical organization in the form of the atoms-functional groups-molecules structure. Hence, the inability of single-scale GMAE models to incorporate these hierarchical relationships often leads to their inadequate capture of crucial high-level graph information, resulting in a noticeable decline in performance. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Graph Masked AutoEncoders (Hi-GMAE), a novel multi-scale GMAE framework designed to handle the hierarchical structures within graphs. First, Hi-GMAE constructs a multi-scale graph hierarchy through graph pooling, enabling the exploration of graph structures across different granularity levels. To ensure masking uniformity of subgraphs across these scales, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine strategy that initiates masking at the coarsest scale and progressively back-projects the mask to the finer scales. Furthermore, we integrate a gradual recovery strategy with the masking process to mitigate the learning challenges posed by completely masked subgraphs. Diverging from the standard graph neural network (GNN) used in GMAE models, Hi-GMAE modifies its encoder and decoder into hierarchical structures. This entails using GNN at the finer scales for detailed local graph analysis and employing a graph transformer at coarser scales to capture global information. Our experiments on 15 graph datasets consistently demonstrate that Hi-GMAE outperforms 17 state-of-the-art self-supervised competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Message passing neural networks, which learn representations through recursively aggregating information from each node and its neighbors, are among the most commonly-used GNNs. However, a wealth of structural information of individual nodes and full graphs is often ignored in such process, which restricts the expressive power of GNNs. Various graph data augmentation methods that enable the message passing with richer structure knowledge have been introduced as one main way to tackle this issue, but they are often focused on individual structure features and difficult to scale up with more structure features. In this work we propose a novel approach, namely collective structure knowledge-augmented graph neural network (CoS-GNN), in which a new message passing method is introduced to allow GNNs to harness a diverse set of node- and graph-level structure features, together with original node features/attributes, in augmented graphs. In doing so, our approach largely improves the structural knowledge modeling of GNNs in both node and graph levels, resulting in substantially improved graph representations. This is justified by extensive empirical results where CoS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in various graph-level learning tasks, including graph classification, anomaly detection, and out-of-distribution generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imbalanced Graph Classification with Multi-scale Oversampling Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04903v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in imbalanced graph classification is to learn expressive representations of the graphs in under-represented (minority) classes. Existing generic imbalanced learning methods, such as oversampling and imbalanced learning loss functions, can be adopted for enabling graph representation learning models to cope with this challenge. However, these methods often directly operate on the graph representations, ignoring rich discriminative information within the graphs and their interactions. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel multi-scale oversampling graph neural network (MOSGNN) that learns expressive minority graph representations based on intra- and inter-graph semantics resulting from oversampled graphs at multiple scales - subgraph, graph, and pairwise graphs. It achieves this by jointly optimizing subgraph-level, graph-level, and pairwise-graph learning tasks to learn the discriminative information embedded within and between the minority graphs. Extensive experiments on 16 imbalanced graph datasets show that MOSGNN i) significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art models, and ii) offers a generic framework, in which different advanced imbalanced learning loss functions can be easily plugged in and obtain significantly improved classification performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing fact verification models usually build a fully connected reasoning graph, which regards claim-evidence pairs as nodes and connects them with edges. They employ the graph to propagate the semantics of the nodes. Nevertheless, the noisy nodes usually propagate their semantics via the edges of the reasoning graph, which misleads the semantic representations of other nodes and amplifies the noise signals. To mitigate the propagation of noisy semantic information, we introduce a Confidential Graph Attention Network (CO-GAT), which proposes a node masking mechanism for modeling the nodes. Specifically, CO-GAT calculates the node confidence score by estimating the relevance between the claim and evidence pieces. Then, the node masking mechanism uses the node confidence scores to control the noise information flow from the vanilla node to the other graph nodes. CO-GAT achieves a 73.59% FEVER score on the FEVER dataset and shows the generalization ability by broadening the effectiveness to the science-specific domain.</p></details> | 12pages |

Recent work introduced novel application of graph neural networks for solving quadratic-cost combinatorial optimization problems. However, effective utilization of models such as graph neural networks to address general problems with higher order constraints is an unresolved challenge. This paper presents a framework, HypOp, which advances the state of the art for solving combinatorial optimization problems in several aspects: (i) it generalizes the prior results to higher order constrained problems with arbitrary cost functions by leveraging hypergraph neural networks; (ii) enables scalability to larger problems by introducing a new distributed and parallel training architecture; (iii) demonstrates generalizability across different problem formulations by transferring knowledge within the same hypergraph; (iv) substantially boosts the solution accuracy compared with the prior art by suggesting a fine-tuning step using simulated annealing; (v) shows a remarkable progress on numerous benchmark examples, including hypergraph MaxCut, satisfiability, and resource allocation problems, with notable run time improvements using a combination of fine-tuning and distributed training techniques. We showcase the application of HypOp in scientific discovery by solving a hypergraph MaxCut problem on NDC drug-substance hypergraph.

One such approach involves placing transformer neutral blocking devices, which interrupt the path of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to limit their impact. The high cost of these devices and the sparsity of transformers that experience high GICs during GMD events, however, calls for a sparse placement strategy that involves high computational cost. To address this challenge, we developed a physics-informed heterogeneous graph neural network (PIHGNN) for solving the graph-based dc-blocker placement problem. Our approach combines a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to capture the diverse types of nodes and edges in ac/dc networks and incorporates the physical laws of the power grid. We train the PIHGNN model using a surrogate power flow model and validate it using case studies. Results demonstrate that PIHGNN can effectively and efficiently support the deployment of GIC dc-current blockers, ensuring the continued supply of electricity to meet societal demands. Our approach has the potential to contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient power grids capable of withstanding the growing threat that GMDs pose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper is accepted by PSCC 2024</p></details> |

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

One important operation for GNNs is the downsampling or pooling that can learn effective embeddings from the node representations. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical pooling operation, namely the Edge-Node Attention-based Differentiable Pooling (ENADPool), for GNNs to learn effective graph representations. Unlike the classical hierarchical pooling operation that is based on the unclear node assignment and simply computes the averaged feature over the nodes of each cluster, the proposed ENADPool not only employs a hard clustering strategy to assign each node into an unique cluster, but also compress the node features as well as their edge connectivity strengths into the resulting hierarchical structure based on the attention mechanism after each pooling step. As a result, the proposed ENADPool simultaneously identifies the importance of different nodes within each separated cluster and edges between corresponding clusters, that significantly addresses the shortcomings of the uniform edge-node based structure information aggregation arising in the classical hierarchical pooling operation. Moreover, to mitigate the over-smoothing problem arising in existing GNNs, we propose a Multi-distance GNN (MD-GNN) model associated with the proposed ENADPool operation, allowing the nodes to actively and directly receive the feature information from neighbors at different random walk steps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MD-GNN associated with the proposed ENADPool.</p></details> |  |

The long input hinders the simultaneous effective modeling of both global high-order relations between sentences and local intra-sentence relations which is the most critical step in extractive summarization. However, existing methods mostly focus on one type of relation, neglecting the simultaneous effective modeling of both relations, which can lead to insufficient learning of semantic representations. In this paper, we propose HAESum, a novel approach utilizing graph neural networks to locally and globally model documents based on their hierarchical discourse structure. First, intra-sentence relations are learned using a local heterogeneous graph. Subsequently, a novel hypergraph self-attention layer is introduced to further enhance the characterization of high-order inter-sentence relations. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAESum and the importance of considering hierarchical structures in modeling long scientific documents.

Subgraph-level explanations are gaining attention for their intuitive appeal. However, most existing subgraph-level explainers face efficiency challenges in explaining GNNs due to complex search processes. The key challenge is to find a balance between intuitiveness and efficiency while ensuring transparency. Additionally, these explainers usually induce subgraphs by nodes, which may introduce less-intuitive disconnected nodes in the subgraph-level explanations or omit many important subgraph structures. In this paper, we reveal that inducing subgraph explanations by edges is more comprehensive than other subgraph inducing techniques. We also emphasize the need of determining the subgraph explanation size for each data instance, as different data instances may involve different important substructures. Building upon these considerations, we introduce a training-free approach, named EiG-Search. We employ an efficient linear-time search algorithm over the edge-induced subgraphs, where the edges are ranked by an enhanced gradient-based importance. We conduct extensive experiments on a total of seven datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and efficiency both quantitatively and qualitatively over the leading baselines.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Integrating Uncertainty-Aware Human Motion Prediction into Graph-Based Manipulator Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09779v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing utilization of industrial robots as complementary collaborators for human workers in re-manufacturing sites. Such a human-robot collaboration (HRC) aims to assist human workers in improving the flexibility and efficiency of labor-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose a human-aware motion planning framework for HRC to effectively compute collision-free motions for manipulators when conducting collaborative tasks with humans. We employ a neural human motion prediction model to enable proactive planning for manipulators. Particularly, rather than blindly trusting and utilizing predicted human trajectories in the manipulator planning, we quantify uncertainties of the neural prediction model to further ensure human safety. Moreover, we integrate the uncertainty-aware prediction into a graph that captures key workspace elements and illustrates their interconnections. Then a graph neural network is leveraged to operate on the constructed graph. Consequently, robot motion planning considers both the dependencies among all the elements in the workspace and the potential influence of future movements of human workers. We experimentally validate the proposed planning framework using a 6-degree-of-freedom manipulator in a shared workspace where a human is performing disassembling tasks. The results demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of improving the smoothness and safety of HRC. A brief video introduction of this work is available as the supplemental materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Desk-AId: Humanitarian Aid Desk Assessment with Geospatial AI for Predicting Landmine Areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09444v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of clearing areas, namely demining, starts by assessing and prioritizing potential hazardous areas (i.e., desk assessment) to go under thorough investigation of experts, who confirm the risk and proceed with the mines clearance operations. This paper presents Desk-AId that supports the desk assessment phase by estimating landmine risks using geospatial data and socioeconomic information. Desk-AId uses a Geospatial AI approach specialized to landmines. The approach includes mixed data sampling strategies and context-enrichment by historical conflicts and key multi-domain facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, health sites). The proposed system addresses the issue of having only ground-truth for confirmed hazardous areas by implementing a new hard-negative data sampling strategy, where negative points are sampled in the vicinity of hazardous areas. Experiments validate Desk-Aid in two domains for landmine risk assessment: 1) country-wide, and 2) uncharted study areas). The proposed approach increases the estimation accuracies up to 92%, for different classification models such as RandomForest (RF), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN).</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 33 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Network based Handwritten Trajectories Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09247v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph neural networks has been proved to be an efficient machine learning technique in real life applications. The handwritten recognition is one of the useful area in real life use where both offline and online handwriting recognition are required. The chain code as feature extraction technique has shown significant results in literature and we have been able to use chain codes with graph neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</p></details> |  |

| **[Enhancing Function Name Prediction using Votes-Based Name Tokenization and Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09112v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse engineers would acquire valuable insights from descriptive function names, which are absent in publicly released binaries. Recent advances in binary function name prediction using data-driven machine learning show promise. However, existing approaches encounter difficulties in capturing function semantics in diverse optimized binaries and fail to reserve the meaning of labels in function names. We propose Epitome, a framework that enhances function name prediction using votes-based name tokenization and multi-task learning, specifically tailored for different compilation optimization binaries. Epitome learns comprehensive function semantics by pre-trained assembly language model and graph neural network, incorporating function semantics similarity prediction task, to maximize the similarity of function semantics in the context of different compilation optimization levels. In addition, we present two data preprocessing methods to improve the comprehensibility of function names. We evaluate the performance of Epitome using 2,597,346 functions extracted from binaries compiled with 5 optimizations (O0-Os) for 4 architectures (x64, x86, ARM, and MIPS). Epitome outperforms the state-of-the-art function name prediction tool by up to 44.34%, 64.16%, and 54.44% in precision, recall, and F1 score, while also exhibiting superior generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 figures, ACM ESEC/FSE 2024</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning in Earthquake Engineering: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09021v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article surveys the growing interest in utilizing Deep Learning (DL) as a powerful tool to address challenging problems in earthquake engineering. Despite decades of advancement in domain knowledge, issues such as uncertainty in earthquake occurrence, unpredictable seismic loads, nonlinear structural responses, and community engagement remain difficult to tackle using domain-specific methods. DL offers promising solutions by leveraging its data-driven capacity for nonlinear mapping, sequential data modeling, automatic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, optimal decision-making, etc. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive review that systematically covers a consistent scope intersecting DL and earthquake engineering. To bridge the gap, the article first discusses methodological advances to elucidate various applicable DL techniques, such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), generative adversarial network (GAN), autoencoder (AE), transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), and graph neural network (GNN). A thorough research landscape is then disclosed by exploring various DL applications across different research topics, including vision-based seismic damage assessment and structural characterization, seismic demand and damage state prediction, seismic response history prediction, regional seismic risk assessment and community resilience, ground motion (GM) for engineering use, seismic response control, and the inverse problem of system/damage identification. Suitable DL techniques for each research topic are identified, emphasizing the preeminence of CNN for vision-based tasks, RNN for sequential data, RL for community resilience, and unsupervised learning for GM analysis. The article also discusses opportunities and challenges for leveraging DL in earthquake engineering research and practice.</p></details> |  |
