| **[Clustering Three-Way Data with Outliers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05288v3)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-variate distributions are a recent addition to the model-based clustering field, thereby making it possible to analyze data in matrix form with complex structure such as images and time series. Due to its recent appearance, there is limited literature on matrix-variate data, with even less on dealing with outliers in these models. An approach for clustering matrix-variate normal data with outliers is discussed. The approach, which uses the distribution of subset log-likelihoods, extends the OCLUST algorithm to matrix-variate normal data and uses an iterative approach to detect and trim outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive deep learning framework for forecasting the decadal world economic outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10874v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The gross domestic product (GDP) is the most widely used indicator in macroeconomics and the main tool for measuring a country's economic output. Due to the diversity and complexity of the world economy, a wide range of models have been used, but there are challenges in making decadal GDP forecasts given unexpected changes such as emergence of catastrophic world events including pandemics and wars. Deep learning models are well suited for modelling temporal sequences and time series forecasting. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to forecast the GDP growth rate of the world economy over a decade. We use the Penn World Table as the data source featuring 13 countries prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Australia, China, India, and the United States. We present a recursive deep learning framework to predict the GDP growth rate in the next ten years. We test prominent deep learning models and compare their results with traditional econometric models for selected developed and developing countries. Our decadal forecasts reveal that that most of the developed countries would experience economic growth slowdown, stagnation and even recession within five years (2020-2024). Furthermore, our model forecasts show that only China, France, and India would experience stable GDP growth.</p></details> |  |
| **[A SSM is Polymerized from Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20310v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For multivariate time series (MTS) tasks, previous state space models (SSMs) followed the modeling paradigm of Transformer-based methods. However, none of them explicitly model the complex dependencies of MTS: the Channel Dependency variations with Time (CDT). In view of this, we delve into the derivation of SSM, which involves approximating continuously updated functions by orthogonal function basis. We then develop Poly-Mamba, a novel method for MTS forecasting. Its core concept is to expand the original orthogonal function basis space into a multivariate orthogonal function space containing variable mixing terms, and make a projection on this space so as to explicitly describe the CDT by weighted coefficients. In Poly-Mamba, we propose the Multivariate Orthogonal Polynomial Approximation (MOPA) as a simplified implementation of this concept. For the simple linear relationship between channels, we propose Linear Channel Mixing (LCM) and generate CDT patterns adaptively for different channels through a proposed Order Combining method. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that Poly-Mamba outperforms the SOTA methods, especially when dealing with datasets having a large number of channels and complex correlations. The codes and log files will be released at: https://github.com/Joeland4/Poly-Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Utilizing Data Fingerprints for Privacy-Preserving Algorithm Selection in Time Series Classification: Performance and Uncertainty Estimation on Unseen Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08636v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The selection of algorithms is a crucial step in designing AI services for real-world time series classification use cases. Traditional methods such as neural architecture search, automated machine learning, combined algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimizations are effective but require considerable computational resources and necessitate access to all data points to run their optimizations. In this work, we introduce a novel data fingerprint that describes any time series classification dataset in a privacy-preserving manner and provides insight into the algorithm selection problem without requiring training on the (unseen) dataset. By decomposing the multi-target regression problem, only our data fingerprints are used to estimate algorithm performance and uncertainty in a scalable and adaptable manner. Our approach is evaluated on the 112 University of California riverside benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the performance of 35 state-of-the-art algorithms and providing valuable insights for effective algorithm selection in time series classification service systems, improving a naive baseline by 7.32% on average in estimating the mean performance and 15.81% in estimating the uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Hawai...</summary><p>Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-58) 2025</p></details> |
| **[CROSS-GAiT: Cross-Attention-Based Multimodal Representation Fusion for Parametric Gait Adaptation in Complex Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17262v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CROSS-GAiT, a novel algorithm for quadruped robots that uses Cross Attention to fuse terrain representations derived from visual and time-series inputs, including linear accelerations, angular velocities, and joint efforts. These fused representations are used to adjust the robot's step height and hip splay, enabling adaptive gaits that respond dynamically to varying terrain conditions. We generate these terrain representations by processing visual inputs through a masked Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and time-series data through a dilated causal convolutional encoder. The cross-attention mechanism then selects and integrates the most relevant features from each modality, combining terrain characteristics with robot dynamics for better-informed gait adjustments. CROSS-GAiT uses the combined representation to dynamically adjust gait parameters in response to varying and unpredictable terrains. We train CROSS-GAiT on data from diverse terrains, including asphalt, concrete, brick pavements, grass, dense vegetation, pebbles, gravel, and sand. Our algorithm generalizes well and adapts to unseen environmental conditions, enhancing real-time navigation performance. CROSS-GAiT was implemented on a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 robot and extensively tested in complex terrains with high vegetation density, uneven/unstable surfaces, sand banks, deformable substrates, etc. We observe at least a 7.04% reduction in IMU energy density and a 27.3% reduction in total joint effort, which directly correlates with increased stability and reduced energy usage when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, CROSS-GAiT demonstrates at least a 64.5% increase in success rate and a 4.91% reduction in time to reach the goal in four complex scenarios. Additionally, the learned representations perform 4.48% better than the state-of-the-art on a terrain classification task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20423v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocates the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocities of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency Adaptive Normalization For Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20371v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting typically needs to address non-stationary data with evolving trend and seasonal patterns. To address the non-stationarity, reversible instance normalization has been recently proposed to alleviate impacts from the trend with certain statistical measures, e.g., mean and variance. Although they demonstrate improved predictive accuracy, they are limited to expressing basic trends and are incapable of handling seasonal patterns. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new instance normalization solution, called frequency adaptive normalization (FAN), which extends instance normalization in handling both dynamic trend and seasonal patterns. Specifically, we employ the Fourier transform to identify instance-wise predominant frequent components that cover most non-stationary factors. Furthermore, the discrepancy of those frequency components between inputs and outputs is explicitly modeled as a prediction task with a simple MLP model. FAN is a model-agnostic method that can be applied to arbitrary predictive backbones. We instantiate FAN on four widely used forecasting models as the backbone and evaluate their prediction performance improvements on eight benchmark datasets. FAN demonstrates significant performance advancement, achieving 7.76% ~ 37.90% average improvements in MSE.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 Poster |
| **[GTransPDM: A Graph-embedded Transformer with Positional Decoupling for Pedestrian Crossing Intention Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20223v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting pedestrian crossing behavioral intention is crucial for autonomous vehicles driving safety. Nonetheless, challenges emerge when using promising images or environmental context masks to extract various factors for time-series network modeling, causing pre-processing errors or a loss in efficiency. Typically, pedestrian positions captured by onboard cameras are often distorted and do not accurately reflect their actual movements. To address these issues, GTransPDM -- a Graph-embedded Transformer with a Position Decoupling Module -- was developed for pedestrian crossing intention prediction by leveraging multi-modal features. First, a positional decoupling module was proposed to decompose the pedestrian lateral movement and simulate depth variations in the image view. Then, a graph-embedded Transformer was designed to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of human pose skeletons, integrating essential factors such as position, skeleton, and ego-vehicle motion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 92% accuracy on the PIE dataset and 87% accuracy on the JAAD dataset, with a processing speed of 0.05ms. It outperforms the state-of-the-art in comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Movement and Trust Development in Human-Robot Teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20218v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For humans and robots to form an effective human-robot team (HRT) there must be sufficient trust between team members throughout a mission. We analyze data from an HRT experiment focused on trust dynamics in teams of one human and two robots, where trust was manipulated by robots becoming temporarily unresponsive. Whole-body movement tracking was achieved using ultrasound beacons, alongside communications and performance logs from a human-robot interface. We find evidence that synchronization between time series of human-robot movement, within a certain spatial proximity, is correlated with changes in self-reported trust. This suggests that the interplay of proxemics and kinesics, i.e. moving together through space, where implicit communication via coordination can occur, could play a role in building and maintaining trust in human-robot teams. Thus, quantitative indicators of coordination dynamics between team members could be used to predict trust over time and also provide early warning signals of the need for timely trust repair if trust is damaged. Hence, we aim to develop the metrology of trust in mobile human-robot teams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Imputation for Healthcare Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16713v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an end-to-end architecture for managing complex missingness in multivariate time series derived from hospital electronic health records (EHRs). Our Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI) is a recurrent neural network architecture equipped with a number of techniques aiming to improve imputation accuracy by aligning the model with the subtle temporal and spatial dependencies typical of clinical data. CSAI a) utilises an attention-based hidden state initialisation to capture long- and short-range correlations within the time-series, b) incorporates a knowledge embedding technique to capture clinical data recording patterns and c) employs a non-uniform masking strategy to adapt its weights to data temporal and cross-sectional missingness patterns. Extensive evaluation of three EHR benchmark data sets demonstrates that CSAI enhances the current state of the art efficacy in data restoration in addition to performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, CSAI is integrated within the PyPOTS Python library for benchmarking, offering open and standardised benchmarking capabilities and ease of use for researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Time Linear Positional Embedding for Irregular Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20092v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series forecasting, characterized by non-uniform intervals, is prevalent in practical applications. However, previous research have been focused on regular time series forecasting, typically relying on transformer architectures. To extend transformers to handle irregular time series, we tackle the positional embedding which represents the temporal information of the data. We propose CTLPE, a method learning a continuous linear function for encoding temporal information. The two challenges of irregular time series, inconsistent observation patterns and irregular time gaps, are solved by learning a continuous-time function and concise representation of position. Additionally, the linear continuous function is empirically shown superior to other continuous functions by learning a neural controlled differential equation-based positional embedding, and theoretically supported with properties of ideal positional embedding. CTLPE outperforms existing techniques across various irregularly-sampled time series datasets, showcasing its enhanced efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paving the way toward foundation models for irregular and unaligned Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08448v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses. As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-FFM: Towards LM-Empowered Federated Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14252v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Selection with a Shapelet-based Distance Measure for Multi-source Transfer Learning in Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20005v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning is a common practice that alleviates the need for extensive data to train neural networks. It is performed by pre-training a model using a source dataset and fine-tuning it for a target task. However, not every source dataset is appropriate for each target dataset, especially for time series. In this paper, we propose a novel method of selecting and using multiple datasets for transfer learning for time series classification. Specifically, our method combines multiple datasets as one source dataset for pre-training neural networks. Furthermore, for selecting multiple sources, our method measures the transferability of datasets based on shapelet discovery for effective source selection. While traditional transferability measures require considerable time for pre-training all the possible sources for source selection of each possible architecture, our method can be repeatedly used for every possible architecture with a single simple computation. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate that it is possible to increase the performance of temporal convolutional neural networks (CNN) on time series datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Pattern Recognition 2024 (ICPR 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20004v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnostic checking of periodic vector autoregressive time series models with dependent errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20001v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the residual autocorrelations for periodic vector autoregressive time series models (PVAR henceforth) with uncorrelated but dependent innovations (i.e., weak PVAR). We then deduce the asymptotic distribution of the Ljung-Box-McLeod modified Portmanteau statistics for weak PVAR models. In Monte Carlo experiments, we illustrate that the proposed test statistics have reasonable finite sample performance. When the innovations exhibit conditional heteroscedasticity or other forms of dependence, it appears that the standard test statistics (under independent and identically distributed innovations) are generally nonreliable, overrejecting, or underrejecting severely, while the proposed test statistics offer satisfactory levels. An illustrative application on real data is also proposed.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSI: A Multi-View Representation Learning Approach for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19871v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the growing demand for long sequence time-series forecasting in real-world applications, such as electricity consumption planning, the significance of time series forecasting becomes increasingly crucial across various domains. This is highlighted by recent advancements in representation learning within the field. This study introduces a novel multi-view approach for time series forecasting that innovatively integrates trend and seasonal representations with an Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-based representation. Recognizing the limitations of existing methods in representing complex and high-dimensional time series data, this research addresses the challenge by combining TS (trend and seasonality) and ICA (independent components) perspectives. This approach offers a holistic understanding of time series data, going beyond traditional models that often miss nuanced, nonlinear relationships. The efficacy of TSI model is demonstrated through comprehensive testing on various benchmark datasets, where it shows superior performance over current state-of-the-art models, particularly in multivariate forecasting. This method not only enhances the accuracy of forecasting but also contributes significantly to the field by providing a more in-depth understanding of time series data. The research which uses ICA for a view lays the groundwork for further exploration and methodological advancements in time series forecasting, opening new avenues for research and practical applications.</p></details> | AJCAI Oral Accepted |
| **[Euclidean mirrors and first-order changepoints in network time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11111v2)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a model for a network time series whose evolution is governed by an underlying stochastic process, known as the latent position process, in which network evolution can be represented in Euclidean space by a curve, called the Euclidean mirror. We define the notion of a first-order changepoint for a time series of networks, and construct a family of latent position process networks with underlying first-order changepoints. We prove that a spectral estimate of the associated Euclidean mirror localizes these changepoints, even when the graph distribution evolves continuously, but at a rate that changes. Simulated and real data examples on organoid networks show that this localization captures empirically significant shifts in network evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving Multi-Scale Normalization for Time Series Forecasting under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19718v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex distribution shifts are the main obstacle to achieving accurate long-term time series forecasting. Several efforts have been conducted to capture the distribution characteristics and propose adaptive normalization techniques to alleviate the influence of distribution shifts. However, these methods neglect the intricate distribution dynamics observed from various scales and the evolving functions of distribution dynamics and normalized mapping relationships. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Evolving Multi-Scale Normalization (EvoMSN) framework to tackle the distribution shift problem. Flexible normalization and denormalization are proposed based on the multi-scale statistics prediction module and adaptive ensembling. An evolving optimization strategy is designed to update the forecasting model and statistics prediction module collaboratively to track the shifting distributions. We evaluate the effectiveness of EvoMSN in improving the performance of five mainstream forecasting methods on benchmark datasets and also show its superiority compared to existing advanced normalization and online learning approaches. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/qindalin/EvoMSN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Source Recovery for Time-Series Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19635v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) has gained popularity for its ability to adapt pretrained models to target domains without accessing source domains, ensuring source data privacy. While SFUDA is well-developed in visual tasks, its application to Time-Series SFUDA (TS-SFUDA) remains limited due to the challenge of transferring crucial temporal dependencies across domains. Although a few researchers begin to explore this area, they rely on specific source domain designs, which are impractical as source data owners cannot be expected to follow particular pretraining protocols. To solve this, we propose Temporal Source Recovery (TemSR), a framework that transfers temporal dependencies for effective TS-SFUDA without requiring source-specific designs. TemSR features a recovery process that leverages masking, recovery, and optimization to generate a source-like distribution with recovered source temporal dependencies. To ensure effective recovery, we further design segment-based regularization to restore local dependencies and anchor-based recovery diversity maximization to enhance the diversity of the source-like distribution. The source-like distribution is then adapted to the target domain using traditional UDA techniques. Extensive experiments across multiple TS tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TemSR, even surpassing existing TS-SFUDA method that requires source domain designs. Code is available in https://github.com/Frank-Wang-oss/TemSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[SITSMamba for Crop Classification based on Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09673v2)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) data provides continuous observations over time, allowing for the tracking of vegetation changes and growth patterns throughout the seasons and years. Numerous deep learning (DL) approaches using SITS for crop classification have emerged recently, with the latest approaches adopting Transformer for SITS classification. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer poses challenges for classifying long time series. While the cutting-edge Mamba architecture has demonstrated strength in various domains, including remote sensing image interpretation, its capacity to learn temporal representations in SITS data remains unexplored. Moreover, the existing SITS classification methods often depend solely on crop labels as supervision signals, which fails to fully exploit the temporal information. In this paper, we proposed a Satellite Image Time Series Mamba (SITSMamba) method for crop classification based on remote sensing time series data. The proposed SITSMamba contains a spatial encoder based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Mamba-based temporal encoder. To exploit richer temporal information from SITS, we design two branches of decoder used for different tasks. The first branch is a crop Classification Branch (CBranch), which includes a ConvBlock to decode the feature to a crop map. The second branch is a SITS Reconstruction Branch that uses a Linear layer to transform the encoded feature to predict the original input values. Furthermore, we design a Positional Weight (PW) applied to the RBranch to help the model learn rich latent knowledge from SITS. We also design two weighting factors to control the balance of the two branches during training. The code of SITSMamba is available at: https://github.com/XiaoleiQinn/SITSMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[KODA: A Data-Driven Recursive Model for Time Series Forecasting and Data Assimilation using Koopman Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19518v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approaches based on Koopman operators have shown great promise in forecasting time series data generated by complex nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDS). Although such approaches are able to capture the latent state representation of a NLDS, they still face difficulty in long term forecasting when applied to real world data. Specifically many real-world NLDS exhibit time-varying behavior, leading to nonstationarity that is hard to capture with such models. Furthermore they lack a systematic data-driven approach to perform data assimilation, that is, exploiting noisy measurements on the fly in the forecasting task. To alleviate the above issues, we propose a Koopman operator-based approach (named KODA - Koopman Operator with Data Assimilation) that integrates forecasting and data assimilation in NLDS. In particular we use a Fourier domain filter to disentangle the data into a physical component whose dynamics can be accurately represented by a Koopman operator, and residual dynamics that represents the local or time varying behavior that are captured by a flexible and learnable recursive model. We carefully design an architecture and training criterion that ensures this decomposition lead to stable and long-term forecasts. Moreover, we introduce a course correction strategy to perform data assimilation with new measurements at inference time. The proposed approach is completely data-driven and can be learned end-to-end. Through extensive experimental comparisons we show that KODA outperforms existing state of the art methods on multiple time series benchmarks such as electricity, temperature, weather, lorenz 63 and duffing oscillator demonstrating its superior performance and efficacy along the three tasks a) forecasting, b) data assimilation and c) state prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient Computation with DVFS using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Task Systems in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19434v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Periodic soft real-time systems have broad applications in many areas, such as IoT. Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying edge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging. This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series information in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to use for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.</p></details> |  |

This pioneering model achieves state-of-the-art performance in demographic prediction, disease diagnosis/prognosis, and trait prediction through fine-tuning. Furthermore, it excels in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) and demonstrates superior generalizability across different ethnic groups, surpassing the previous large model for brain activity significantly. Brain-JEPA incorporates two innovative techniques: Brain Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking. Brain Gradient Positioning introduces a functional coordinate system for brain functional parcellation, enhancing the positional encoding of different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Spatiotemporal Masking, tailored to the unique characteristics of fMRI data, addresses the challenge of heterogeneous time-series patches. These methodologies enhance model performance and advance our understanding of the neural circuits underlying cognition. Overall, Brain-JEPA is paving the way to address pivotal questions of building brain functional coordinate system and masking brain activity at the AI-neuroscience interface, and setting a potentially new paradigm in brain activity analysis through downstream adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05042v2)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from various domains is continuously growing, and extracting and analyzing temporal patterns within these series can provide valuable insights. Temporal pattern mining (TPM) extends traditional pattern mining by incorporating event time intervals into patterns, making them more expressive but also increasing the computational complexity in terms of time and space. One important type of temporal pattern is the rare temporal pattern (RTP), which occurs infrequently but with high confidence. Mining these rare patterns poses several challenges, for example, the low support threshold can lead to a combinatorial explosion and the generation of many irrelevant patterns. To address this, an efficient approach to mine rare temporal patterns is essential. This paper introduces the Rare Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (RTPMfTS) method, designed to discover rare temporal patterns. The key contributions of this work are as follows: (1) An end-to-end RTPMfTS process that takes time series data as input and outputs rare temporal patterns.

We develop a test for identifying change-points in the mean of data coming from such a model, aiming to detect shifts in the underlying distribution. Additionally, we propose a consistent estimator for the spectral density of the data, contingent upon fundamental assumptions, notably the long-run variance. By leveraging probabilistic techniques, our approach provides reliable tools for understanding temporal changes in linear process data. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy and consistency of our proposed methods, offering valuable insights for practitioners in various fields dealing with time series data analysis. Finally, we implemented our method on bitcoin data for identifying the time points of significant changes in its stock price.</p></details> |  |

This paper reports a comprehensive application of state-of-the-art machine learning to the retailing domain with a specific focus on association rule mining, sequential pattern mining, and time-series forecasting. Association rules: Relationship Mining This provides the key product relationships and customer buying patterns that form the basis of individually tailored marketing campaigns. Sequential pattern mining: Using the PrefixSpan algorithm, it identifies frequent sequences of purchasing products-extremely powerful insights into consumer behavior and also better management of the inventories. What is applied for sales trend forecasting models Prophet applies on historical transaction data over seasonality, holidays, and long-term growth. The forecast results allow predicting demand variations, thus helping in proper inventory alignment and avoiding overstocking or understocking of inventory. Our results are checked through the help of metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to ensure our predictions are strong and accurate. We will combine the aspects of all of these techniques to prove how predictive modeling and temporal pattern analysis can help optimize control over inventory, enhance marketing effectiveness, and position retail businesses as they rise to ever greater heights.

This paper delves into both the theoretical and practical applications of ARDTs in this new context. We theoretically demonstrate that ARDTs can compute complex functions, such as simulating automata, Turing machines, and sparse circuits, by leveraging "chain-of-thought" computations. Our analysis provides bounds on the size, depth, and computational efficiency of ARDTs, highlighting their surprising computational power. Empirically, we train ARDTs on simple language generation tasks, showing that they can learn to generate coherent and grammatically correct text on par with a smaller Transformer model. Additionally, we show that ARDTs can be used on top of transformer representations to solve complex reasoning tasks. This research reveals the unique computational abilities of ARDTs, aiming to broaden the architectural diversity in language model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Modern technological devices such as video recorders and drones now allow researchers to directly observe an animal's behaviour. Using these observations as labels of the latent process can improve a hidden Markov model's accuracy when decoding the latent process. However, many wild animals are observed infrequently. Including such rare labels often has a negligible influence on parameter estimates, which in turn does not meaningfully improve the accuracy of the decoded latent process. We introduce a weighted likelihood approach that increases the relative influence of labelled observations. We use this approach to develop two hidden Markov models to decode the foraging behaviour of killer whales (Orcinus orca) off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Using cross-validated evaluation metrics, we show that our weighted likelihood approach produces more accurate and understandable decoded latent processes compared to existing methods. Thus, our method effectively leverages sparse labels to enhance researchers' ability to accurately decode hidden processes across various fields.</p></details> | 25 pages, 11 figures |

One of the primary approaches to anomaly detection are methods based on forecasting. Nevertheless, extensive real-world network datasets for forecasting and anomaly detection techniques are missing, potentially causing performance overestimation of anomaly detection algorithms. This manuscript addresses this gap by introducing a dataset comprising time series data of network entities' behavior, collected from the CESNET3 network. The dataset was created from 40 weeks of network traffic of 275 thousand active IP addresses. The ISP origin of the presented data ensures a high level of variability among network entities, which forms a unique and authentic challenge for forecasting and anomaly detection models. It provides valuable insights into the practical deployment of forecast-based anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> |  |

Methods for trajectory classification are particularly important to detect different movement patterns, while methods for regression to compute motility metrics and forecasting. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the processing of trajectories rendered as images via artificial neural networks with 2d convolutional layers (CNNs). This approach leverages the capability of CNNs to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, necessary to recognize complex shapes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitation of other machine learning methods that require input trajectories with a fixed number of points. However, rendering trajectories as images can introduce poorly investigated artifacts such as information loss due to the plotting of coordinates on a discrete grid, and spectral changes due to line thickness and aliasing. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CNNs for solving classification and regression problems from synthetic trajectories that have been rendered as images using different modalities. The parameters considered in this study include line thickness, image resolution, usage of motion history (color-coding of the temporal component) and anti-aliasing. Results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate image resolution according to model depth and motion history in applications where movement direction is critical.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rethinking the Power of Timestamps for Robust Time Series Forecasting: A Global-Local Fusion Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18696v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has played a pivotal role across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate. Due to the abundant seasonal information they contain, timestamps possess the potential to offer robust global guidance for forecasting techniques. However, existing works primarily focus on local observations, with timestamps being treated merely as an optional supplement that remains underutilized. When data gathered from the real world is polluted, the absence of global information will damage the robust prediction capability of these algorithms. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named GLAFF. Within this framework, the timestamps are modeled individually to capture the global dependencies. Working as a plugin, GLAFF adaptively adjusts the combined weights for global and local information, enabling seamless collaboration with any time series forecasting backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that GLAFF significantly enhances the average performance of widely used mainstream forecasting models by 12.5%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by 5.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

The package is accessible to those with minimal R experience and, in particular, implements ForceAtlas2, the key layout feature developed for Gephi by Jacomy et al. (2014). The most significant advancement is the ability to pass previous positions into ForceAtlas2 as baselines, a particularly useful feature for plotting the evolution of network layouts for time series data. GephiForR is especially suited for networks of less than 1000 nodes, simply because R's dependence on single-thread computation means that larger networks take longer to compute, but the package can handle these larger networks as well. I demonstrate the package's capabilities through various examples and comparisons with existing tools and Gephi itself, assessing performance and speed.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces TemporalPaD, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework designed for temporal pattern datasets. TemporalPaD integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with neural networks to achieve concurrent feature representation and feature reduction. The framework consists of three cooperative modules: a Policy Module, a Representation Module, and a Classification Module, structured based on the Actor-Critic (AC) framework. The Policy Module, responsible for dimensionality reduction through RL, functions as the actor, while the Representation Module for feature extraction and the Classification Module collectively serve as the critic. We comprehensively evaluate TemporalPaD using 29 UCI datasets, a well-known benchmark for validating feature reduction algorithms, through 10 independent tests and 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, given that TemporalPaD is specifically designed for time series data, we apply it to a real-world DNA classification problem involving enhancer category and enhancer strength. The results demonstrate that TemporalPaD is an efficient and effective framework for achieving feature reduction, applicable to both structured data and sequence datasets. The source code of the proposed TemporalPaD is freely available as supplementary material to this article and at http://www.healthinformaticslab.org/supp/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Trace Minimization for the Reconciliation of Very Short Hierarchical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18550v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series often appear in an additive hierarchical structure. In such cases, time series on higher levels are the sums of their subordinate time series. This hierarchical structure places a natural constraint on forecasts. However, univariate forecasting techniques are incapable of ensuring this forecast coherence. An obvious solution is to forecast only bottom time series and obtain higher level forecasts through aggregation. This approach is also known as the bottom-up approach. In their seminal paper, \citep{Wickramasuriya2019} propose an optimal reconciliation approach named MinT. It tries to minimize the trace of the underlying covariance matrix of all forecast errors. The MinT algorithm has demonstrated superior performance to the bottom-up and other approaches and enjoys great popularity. This paper provides a simulation study examining the performance of MinT for very short time series and larger hierarchical structures. This scenario makes the covariance estimation required by MinT difficult. A novel iterative approach is introduced which significantly reduces the number of estimated parameters. This approach is capable of improving forecast accuracy further. The application of MinTit is also demonstrated with a case study at the hand of a semiconductor dataset based on data provided by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), a premier provider of semiconductor market data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Driven Temporal Domain Adaptation for Nighttime UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18533v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nighttime UAV tracking under low-illuminated scenarios has achieved great progress by domain adaptation (DA). However, previous DA training-based works are deficient in narrowing the discrepancy of temporal contexts for UAV trackers. To address the issue, this work proposes a prompt-driven temporal domain adaptation training framework to fully utilize temporal contexts for challenging nighttime UAV tracking, i.e., TDA. Specifically, the proposed framework aligns the distribution of temporal contexts from daytime and nighttime domains by training the temporal feature generator against the discriminator. The temporal-consistent discriminator progressively extracts shared domain-specific features to generate coherent domain discrimination results in the time series. Additionally, to obtain high-quality training samples, a prompt-driven object miner is employed to precisely locate objects in unannotated nighttime videos. Moreover, a new benchmark for long-term nighttime UAV tracking is constructed. Exhaustive evaluations on both public and self-constructed nighttime benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable performance of the tracker trained in TDA framework, i.e., TDA-Track. Real-world tests at nighttime also show its practicality. The code and demo videos are available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/TDA-Track.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2024 |
| **[Treating Brain-inspired Memories as Priors for Diffusion Model to Forecast Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18491v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting Multivariate Time Series (MTS) involves significant challenges in various application domains. One immediate challenge is modeling temporal patterns with the finite length of the input. These temporal patterns usually involve periodic and sudden events that recur across different channels. To better capture temporal patterns, we get inspiration from humans' memory mechanisms and propose a channel-shared, brain-inspired memory module for MTS. Specifically, brain-inspired memory comprises semantic and episodic memory, where the former is used to capture general patterns, such as periodic events, and the latter is employed to capture special patterns, such as sudden events, respectively. Meanwhile, we design corresponding recall and update mechanisms to better utilize these patterns. Furthermore, acknowledging the capacity of diffusion models to leverage memory as a prior, we present a brain-inspired memory-augmented diffusion model. This innovative model retrieves relevant memories for different channels, utilizing them as distinct priors for MTS predictions. This incorporation significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Experimental results on eight datasets consistently validate the superiority of our approach in capturing and leveraging diverse recurrent temporal patterns across different channels.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSTFL: A Heterogeneous Federated Learning Framework for Misaligned Spatiotemporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18482v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting has emerged as an indispensable building block of diverse smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation and smart energy management. Recent advancements have uncovered that the performance of spatiotemporal forecasting can be significantly improved by integrating knowledge in geo-distributed time series data from different domains, \eg enhancing real-estate appraisal with human mobility data; joint taxi and bike demand predictions. While effective, existing approaches assume a centralized data collection and exploitation environment, overlooking the privacy and commercial interest concerns associated with data owned by different parties. In this paper, we investigate multi-party collaborative spatiotemporal forecasting without direct access to multi-source private data. However, this task is challenging due to 1) cross-domain feature heterogeneity and 2) cross-client geographical heterogeneity, where standard horizontal or vertical federated learning is inapplicable. To this end, we propose a Heterogeneous SpatioTemporal Federated Learning (HSTFL) framework to enable multiple clients to collaboratively harness geo-distributed time series data from different domains while preserving privacy. Specifically, we first devise vertical federated spatiotemporal representation learning to locally preserve spatiotemporal dependencies among individual participants and generate effective representations for heterogeneous data. Then we propose a cross-client virtual node alignment block to incorporate cross-client spatiotemporal dependencies via a multi-level knowledge fusion scheme. Extensive privacy analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that HSTFL not only effectively resists inference attacks but also provides a significant improvement against various baselines.</p></details> | Under review |

Various techniques are available to achieve h - step ahead coherent forecasts of count time series, like median and mode forecasting. However, there needs to be more body of literature addressing coherent forecasting in the context of overdispersed count time series. Here, we study the forecasting distribution corresponding to NoGeAR(1) process using the Monte Carlo (MC) approximation method. Accordingly, several forecasting measures are employed in the simulation study to facilitate a thorough comparison of the forecasting capability of NoGeAR(1) with other models. The methodology is also demonstrated using real-life data, specifically the data on CW{\ss} TeXpert downloads and Barbados COVID-19 data.</p></details> |  |
| **[CycleNet: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Modeling Periodic Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18479v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stable periodic patterns present in time series data serve as the foundation for conducting long-horizon forecasts. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of explicitly modeling this periodicity to enhance the performance of models in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) technique, which utilizes learnable recurrent cycles to model the inherent periodic patterns within sequences, and then performs predictions on the residual components of the modeled cycles. Combining RCF with a Linear layer or a shallow MLP forms the simple yet powerful method proposed in this paper, called CycleNet. CycleNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in multiple domains including electricity, weather, and energy, while offering significant efficiency advantages by reducing over 90% of the required parameter quantity. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play technique, the RCF can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy of existing models, including PatchTST and iTransformer.

| **[Sensor Response-Time Reduction using Long-Short Term Memory Network Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17144v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The response time of a biosensor is a crucial metric in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnostics where an earlier diagnosis can markedly improve patient outcomes. However, the speed at which a biosensor reaches a final equilibrium state can be limited by poor mass transport and long molecular diffusion times that increase the time it takes target molecules to reach the active sensing region of a biosensor. While optimization of system and sensor design can promote molecules reaching the sensing element faster, a simpler and complementary approach for response time reduction that is widely applicable across all sensor platforms is to use time-series forecasting to predict the ultimate steady-state sensor response. In this work, we show that ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can accurately predict equilibrium biosensor response from a small quantity of initial time-dependent biosensor measurements, allowing for significant reduction in response time by a mean and median factor of improvement of 18.6 and 5.1 respectively. The ensemble of models simultaneously estimates uncertainty, which is vital for ensuring confidence in the predictions and subsequent safety-related decisions that are made. This approach is demonstrated on real-time experimental data collected by exposing porous silicon biosensors to buffered protein solutions using a multi-channel fluidic cell that enables the automated measurement of 100 porous silicon biosensors in parallel. The dramatic improvement in sensor response time achieved using LSTM network ensembles and associated uncertainty quantification opens the door to trustworthy and faster responding biosensors, enabling more rapid medical diagnostics for faster clinical decision making that can lead to improved patient outcomes and healthcare access, as well as quicker identification of toxins in food and the environment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Learning Transferable Time Series Classifier with Cross-Domain Pre-training from Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12372v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in self-supervised pre-training (SSL) have significantly advanced the field of learning transferable time series representations, which can be very useful in enhancing the downstream task. Despite being effective, most existing works struggle to achieve cross-domain SSL pre-training, missing valuable opportunities to integrate patterns and features from different domains. The main challenge lies in the significant differences in the characteristics of time-series data across different domains, such as variations in the number of channels and temporal resolution scales. To address this challenge, we propose CrossTimeNet, a novel cross-domain SSL learning framework to learn transferable knowledge from various domains to largely benefit the target downstream task. One of the key characteristics of CrossTimeNet is the newly designed time series tokenization module, which could effectively convert the raw time series into a sequence of discrete tokens based on a reconstruction optimization process. Besides, we highlight that predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens can be very helpful for extracting informative patterns across different domains during SSL pre-training, which has been largely overlooked in past years. Furthermore, unlike previous works, our work treats the pre-training language model (PLM) as the initialization of the encoder network, investigating the feasibility of transferring the knowledge learned by the PLM to the time series area. Through these efforts, the path to cross-domain pre-training of a generic time series model can be effectively paved. We conduct extensive experiments in a real-world scenario across various time series classification domains. The experimental results clearly confirm CrossTimeNet's superior performance.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v4)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, our goal is to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of using a causality-based approach for fMRI fingerprinting. Specifically, we propose an innovative method that utilizes the causal dynamics activities of the brain to identify the unique cognitive patterns of individuals (e.g., subject fingerprint) and fMRI tasks (e.g., task fingerprint). The key novelty of our approach stems from the development of a two-timescale linear state-space model to extract 'spatio-temporal' (aka causal) signatures from an individual's fMRI time series data. To the best of our knowledge, we pioneer and subsequently quantify, in this paper, the concept of 'causal fingerprint.' Our method is well-separated from other fingerprint studies as we quantify fingerprints from a cause-and-effect perspective, which are then incorporated with a modal decomposition and projection method to perform subject identification and a GNN-based (Graph Neural Network) model to perform task identification. Finally, we show that the experimental results and comparisons with non-causality-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We visualize the obtained causal signatures and discuss their biological relevance in light of the existing understanding of brain functionalities. Collectively, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

Recently, an extension to the N-BEATS model for univariate time series point forecasting was proposed to include forecast stability as an additional optimization objective, next to accuracy. It was shown that more stable forecasts can be obtained without harming accuracy by minimizing a composite loss function that contains both a forecast error and a forecast instability component, with a static hyperparameter to control the impact of stability. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether further improvements in stability can be obtained without compromising accuracy by applying dynamic loss weighting algorithms, which change the loss weights during training. We show that some existing dynamic loss weighting methods achieve this objective. However, our proposed extension to the Random Weighting approach -- Task-Aware Random Weighting -- shows the best performance.</p></details> |  |

It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.

On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than $99\%$ accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $2.58 \pm 0.12$ mm mean distance error. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.</p></details> |  |

While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior. This aspect becomes particularly critical when the monitored system is deployed in a vital environment. In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, + Supplemental Materials, Published at Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

| **[Rediscovering Bottom-Up: Effective Forecasting in Temporal Hierarchies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02367v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecast reconciliation has become a prominent topic in recent forecasting literature, with a primary distinction made between cross-sectional and temporal hierarchies. This work focuses on temporal hierarchies, such as aggregating monthly time series data to annual data. We explore the impact of various forecast reconciliation methods on temporally aggregated ARIMA models, thereby bridging the fields of hierarchical forecast reconciliation and temporal aggregation both theoretically and experimentally. Our paper is the first to theoretically examine the effects of temporal hierarchical forecast reconciliation, demonstrating that the optimal method aligns with a bottom-up aggregation approach. To assess the practical implications and performance of the reconciled forecasts, we conduct a series of simulation studies, confirming that the findings extend to more complex models. This result helps explain the strong performance of the bottom-up approach observed in many prior studies. Finally, we apply our methods to real data examples, where we observe similar results.</p></details> |  |
| **[A multi-source data power load forecasting method using attention mechanism-based parallel cnn-gru](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17889v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate power load forecasting is crucial for improving energy efficiency and ensuring power supply quality. Considering the power load forecasting problem involves not only dynamic factors like historical load variations but also static factors such as climate conditions that remain constant over specific periods. From the model-agnostic perspective, this paper proposes a parallel structure network to extract important information from both dynamic and static data. Firstly, based on complexity learning theory, it is demonstrated that models integrated through parallel structures exhibit superior generalization abilities compared to individual base learners. Additionally, the higher the independence between base learners, the stronger the generalization ability of the parallel structure model. This suggests that the structure of machine learning models inherently contains significant information. Building on this theoretical foundation, a parallel convolutional neural network (CNN)-gate recurrent unit (GRU) attention model (PCGA) is employed to address the power load forecasting issue, aiming to effectively integrate the influences of dynamic and static features. The CNN module is responsible for capturing spatial characteristics from static data, while the GRU module captures long-term dependencies in dynamic time series data. The attention layer is designed to focus on key information from the spatial-temporal features extracted by the parallel CNN-GRU. To substantiate the advantages of the parallel structure model in extracting and integrating multi-source information, a series of experiments are conducted.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces an advanced methodology for supervised classification by integrating Functional Data Analysis (FDA) with tree-based ensemble techniques for classifying high-dimensional time series. The proposed framework, Enriched Functional Tree-Based Classifiers (EFTCs), leverages derivative and geometric features, benefiting from the diversity inherent in ensemble methods to further enhance predictive performance and reduce variance. While our approach has been tested on the enrichment of Functional Classification Trees (FCTs), Functional K-NN (FKNN), Functional Random Forest (FRF), Functional XGBoost (FXGB), and Functional LightGBM (FLGBM), it could be extended to other tree-based and non-tree-based classifiers, with appropriate considerations emerging from this investigation. Through extensive experimental evaluations on seven real-world datasets and six simulated scenarios, this proposal demonstrates fascinating improvements over traditional approaches, providing new insights into the application of FDA in complex, high-dimensional learning problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Granger Causality for Mixed Time Series Generalized Linear Models: A Case Study on Multimodal Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17751v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is motivated by studies in neuroscience experiments to understand interactions between nodes in a brain network using different types of data modalities that capture different distinct facets of brain activity. To assess Granger-causality, we introduce a flexible framework through a general class of models that accommodates mixed types of data (binary, count, continuous, and positive components) formulated in a generalized linear model (GLM) fashion. Statistical inference for causality is performed based on both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, with a focus on the latter. Here, we develop a procedure for conducting inference through the proposed Bayesian mixed time series model. By introducing spike and slab priors for some parameters in the model, our inferential approach guides causality order selection and provides proper uncertainty quantification. The proposed methods are then utilized to study the rat spike train and local field potentials (LFP) data recorded during the olfaction working memory task. The proposed methodology provides critical insights into the causal relationship between the rat spiking activity and LFP spectral power. Specifically, power in the LFP beta band is predictive of spiking activity 300 milliseconds later, providing a novel analytical tool for this area of emerging interest in neuroscience and demonstrating its usefulness and flexibility in the study of causality in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Stationarity of Manifold Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17706v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern interdisciplinary research, manifold time series data have been garnering more attention. A critical question in analyzing such data is ``stationarity'', which reflects the underlying dynamic behavior and is crucial across various fields like cell biology, neuroscience and empirical finance. Yet, there has been an absence of a formal definition of stationarity that is tailored to manifold time series. This work bridges this gap by proposing the first definitions of first-order and second-order stationarity for manifold time series. Additionally, we develop novel statistical procedures to test the stationarity of manifold time series and study their asymptotic properties. Our methods account for the curved nature of manifolds, leading to a more intricate analysis than that in Euclidean space. The effectiveness of our methods is evaluated through numerical simulations and their practical merits are demonstrated through analyzing a cell-type proportion time series dataset from a paper recently published in Cell. The first-order stationarity test result aligns with the biological findings of this paper, while the second-order stationarity test provides numerical support for a critical assumption made therein.</p></details> |  |
| **[PGN: The RNN's New Successor is Effective for Long-Range Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17703v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the recurrent structure of RNN, the long information propagation path poses limitations in capturing long-term dependencies, gradient explosion/vanishing issues, and inefficient sequential execution. Based on this, we propose a novel paradigm called Parallel Gated Network (PGN) as the new successor to RNN. PGN directly captures information from previous time steps through the designed Historical Information Extraction (HIE) layer and leverages gated mechanisms to select and fuse it with the current time step information. This reduces the information propagation path to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, effectively addressing the limitations of RNN. To enhance PGN's performance in long-range time series forecasting tasks, we propose a novel temporal modeling framework called Temporal PGN (TPGN). TPGN incorporates two branches to comprehensively capture the semantic information of time series. One branch utilizes PGN to capture long-term periodic patterns while preserving their local characteristics. The other branch employs patches to capture short-term information and aggregate the global representation of the series. TPGN achieves a theoretical complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, ensuring efficiency in its operations. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and high efficiency of TPGN, further confirming the effectiveness of PGN as the new successor to RNN in long-range time series forecasting. The code is available in this repository: \url{https://github.com/Water2sea/TPGN}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks for Temporal Data Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16959v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal data modelling techniques with neural networks are useful in many domain applications, including time-series forecasting and control engineering. This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

For $N$ inputs the problem is $2^N$ hard. In image processing, clusters of pixels, referred to as superpixels, are used to streamline computations. This research presents an efficient solution for time-seres-like data that adapts the idea of superpixels for Shapley value computation. Motivated by a forensic DNA classification example, the method is applied to multivariate time-series-like data whose features have been classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). In DNA processing, it is important to identify alleles from the background noise created by DNA extraction and processing. A single DNA profile has $31,200$ scan points to classify, and the classification decisions must be defensible in a court of law. This means that classification is routinely performed by human readers - a monumental and time consuming process. The application of a CNN with fast computation of meaningful Shapley values provides a potential alternative to the classification. This research demonstrates the realistic, accurate and fast computation of Shapley values for this massive task</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CMamba: Channel Correlation Enhanced State Space Models for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05316v3)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multivariate time series forecasting have been propelled by Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models, with Transformer-based architectures gaining prominence for their efficacy in temporal and cross-channel mixing. More recently, Mamba, a state space model, has emerged with robust sequence and feature mixing capabilities. However, the suitability of the vanilla Mamba design for time series forecasting remains an open question, particularly due to its inadequate handling of cross-channel dependencies. Capturing cross-channel dependencies is critical in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series prediction. Recent findings show that self-attention excels in capturing cross-channel dependencies, whereas other simpler mechanisms, such as MLP, may degrade model performance. This is counterintuitive, as MLP, being a learnable architecture, should theoretically capture both correlations and irrelevances, potentially leading to neutral or improved performance. Diving into the self-attention mechanism, we attribute the observed degradation in MLP performance to its lack of data dependence and global receptive field, which result in MLP's lack of generalization ability. Based on the above insights, we introduce a refined Mamba variant tailored for time series forecasting. Our proposed model, \textbf{CMamba}, incorporates a modified Mamba (M-Mamba) module for temporal dependencies modeling, a global data-dependent MLP (GDD-MLP) to effectively capture cross-channel dependencies, and a Channel Mixup mechanism to mitigate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our model in improving forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates various social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations for enriched insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning and reflection to evaluate predictions. This enables our model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By compiling selected news with time series data, we fine-tune the LLaMa2 pre-trained model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and suggest a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting by effectively harnessing unstructured news data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Time Series is Worth Five Experts: Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17440v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic prediction faces significant challenges, necessitating a deep understanding of both temporal and spatial cues and their complex interactions across multiple variables. Recent advancements in traffic prediction systems are primarily due to the development of complex sequence-centric models. However, existing approaches often embed multiple variables and spatial relationships at each time step, which may hinder effective variable-centric learning, ultimately leading to performance degradation in traditional traffic prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce variable-centric and prior knowledge-centric modeling techniques. Specifically, we propose a Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (TITAN) model for traffic flow prediction. TITAN initially consists of three experts focused on sequence-centric modeling. Then, designed a low-rank adaptive method, TITAN simultaneously enables variable-centric modeling. Furthermore, we supervise the gating process using a prior knowledge-centric modeling strategy to ensure accurate routing. Experiments on two public traffic network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate that TITAN effectively captures variable-centric dependencies while ensuring accurate routing. Consequently, it achieves improvements in all evaluation metrics, ranging from approximately 4.37\% to 11.53\%, compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Using the Doppler shift velocity, the continuum intensity, and the magnetic field observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we have created time-series datasets of acoustic power and magnetic flux, which are used to train LSTM models on predicting continuum intensity, 12 hours in advance. These novel machine learning (ML) models are able to capture variations of the acoustic power density associated with upcoming magnetic flux emergence and continuum intensity decrease. Testing of the models' performance was done on data for 5 ARs, unseen from the models during training. Model 8, the best performing model trained, was able to make a successful prediction of emergence for all testing active regions in an experimental setting and three of them in an operational. The model predicted the emergence of AR11726, AR13165, and AR13179 respectively 10, 29, and 5 hours in advance, and variations of this model achieved average RMSE values of 0.11 for both active and quiet areas on the solar disc.

Our research establishes that pre-finetuning language models with IDED can enhance performance in text-based stock movement predictions. In addition, we juxtapose our proposed pre-finetuning task with sentiment analysis pre-finetuning, further affirming the significance of learning impact duration. Our findings highlight the promise of this novel research direction in stock movement prediction, offering a new avenue for financial forecasting.

However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nothing Conformal about Adaptive Conformal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15548v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a widely-used framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification, which generates valid prediction sets at a user-defined significance level. However, this framework relies on the assumption that the data-generating distribution is exchangeable, a condition that is frequently violated in time-series and other structured data. In such cases, the validity guarantees of conformal prediction break down. Adaptive conformal inference (ACI) has been proposed as a solution for non-exchangeable data by dynamically adjusting the significance level to retain at least finite sample guarantees on the marginal coverage error rate. This paper demonstrates that, despite its name, ACI does not strictly require the use of conformal predictors. Instead, it can operate effectively with the more general concept of a confidence predictor, which is often computationally simpler. The key requirement is that larger significance levels correspond to smaller prediction sets, a property known as nested prediction sets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we investigate whether ACI with conformal predictors offers advantages over confidence predictors. Our results indicate that confidence predictors can perform just as well, and sometimes better than conformal predictors in some cases, although further empirical studies are needed to determine when one approach may be preferable.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |

By utilizing sparse regression and Elastic-Net regularization techniques, the study identifies causal relationships between key remotely sensed variables-such as NDVI, precipitation, and temperature-and agricultural yield. To further enhance prediction accuracy, the first- and second-order dynamic transformations (velocity and acceleration) of these variables are applied, capturing non-linear patterns and delayed effects on yield. The findings highlight the improved predictive performance when combining regularization techniques with climatic and geospatial variables, enabling more precise forecasts of yield variability. The results confirm the existence of causal relationships in the Granger sense, emphasizing the value of this methodology for strategic agricultural management. This contributes to more efficient and sustainable production in paddy rice cultivation.</p></details> |  |

These problems lead to severe water shortages that threaten ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities. To advance the fight against these challenges, we present a new dataset, SEN12-WATER, along with a benchmark using a novel end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) framework for proactive drought-related analysis. The dataset, identified as a spatiotemporal datacube, integrates SAR polarization, elevation, slope, and multispectral optical bands.

Our methodology takes advantage of the multitemporal and multimodal characteristics of the proposed dataset, enabling robust generalization and advancing understanding of drought, contributing to climate change resilience and sustainable water resource management. The proposed framework involves, among the several components, speckle noise removal from SAR data, a water body segmentation through a U-Net architecture, the time series analysis, and the predictive capability of a Time-Distributed-Convolutional Neural Network (TD-CNN).

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal starting point for time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16843v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on time series forecasting mainly focus on improving the forecasting models themselves. However, managing the length of the input data can also significantly enhance prediction performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimal Starting Point Time Series Forecast (OSP-TSP) to capture the intrinsic characteristics of time series data. By adjusting the sequence length via leveraging the XGBoost and LightGBM models, the proposed approach can determine optimal starting point (OSP) of the time series and thus enhance the prediction performances. The performances of the OSP-TSP approach are then evaluated across various frequencies on the M4 dataset and other real-world datasets. Empirical results indicate that predictions based on the OSP-TSP approach consistently outperform those using the complete dataset. Moreover, recognizing the necessity of sufficient data to effectively train models for OSP identification, we further propose targeted solutions to address the issue of data insufficiency.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in exploring the impact of food intake on physiological indicators (e.g., weight) over time. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the DietDiary dataset, which encompasses daily dietary diaries and corresponding weight measurements of real users. Furthermore, we propose a novel task of weight prediction with a dietary diary that aims to leverage historical food intake and weight to predict future weights. To tackle this task, we propose a model-agnostic time series forecasting framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Meal Representation Learning (UMRL) module to extract representations for each meal. Additionally, we design a diet-aware loss function to associate food intake with weight variations. By conducting experiments on the DietDiary dataset with two state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, NLinear and iTransformer, we demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to the original models. We make our dataset, code, and models publicly available at: https://yxg1005.github.io/weight-prediction/.</p></details> | ACM MM'24 oral |

This study conducts a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

This is achieved by embedding tabular data into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces resulting in similar structures as time-series data. We introduce a novel credibility mechanism to this Transformer architecture. This credibility mechanism is based on a special token that should be seen as an encoder that consists of a credibility weighted average of prior information and observation based information. We demonstrate that this novel credibility mechanism is very beneficial to stabilize training, and our Credibility Transformer leads to predictive models that are superior to state-of-the-art deep learning models.</p></details> | 30 pages |

In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.</p></details> |  |

We used ECG-Image-Kit, an open-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG printouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions such as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both digitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records from the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create high-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both programmatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking, staining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various lighting conditions to create real-world artifacts. The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide range of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth time-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing machine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The images vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs of degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization algorithms. ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and non-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for developing robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG images into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG digitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used in the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fi$^2$VTS: Time Series Forecasting Via Capturing Intra- and Inter-Variable Variations in the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21275v5)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in various applications, including electricity transformation, medical monitoring, and crop growth. Despite the advancements in deep learning methods for TSF, their capacity to predict long-term series remains constrained. This limitation arises from the failure to account for both intra- and inter-variable variations meanwhile. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce the Fi$^2$VBlock, which leverages a \textbf{F}requency domain perspective to capture \textbf{i}ntra- and \textbf{i}nter-variable \textbf{V}ariations. After transforming into the frequency domain via the Frequency Transform Module, the Frequency Cross Attention between the real and imaginary parts is designed to obtain enhanced frequency representations and capture intra-variable variations. Furthermore, Inception blocks are employed to integrate information, thus capturing correlations across different variables. Our backbone network, Fi$^2$VTS, employs a residual architecture by concatenating multiple Fi$^2$VBlocks, thereby preventing degradation issues. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Fi$^2$VTS achieves a substantial reduction in both time and memory complexity, decreasing from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ per Fi$^2$VBlock computation. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets reveal that Fi$^2$VTS delivers an overall relative Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction of 30\% and an overall relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction of 22\% when compared to the latest state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is accessible at \url{https://github.com/HITshenrj/Fi2VTS}.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT .</p></details> |  |

Despite a recent increase in the number of automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are not available at every forecast cycle. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; it relies only on geostationary IR satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10-15 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 10 channels at lag times up to 3 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.9/23.3/32.0 km for all systems, 25.7/22.3/30.5 km for tropical systems, and 15.7/13.6/18.6 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors when microwave or scatterometer data are available, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification (UQ), producing a well calibrated ensemble of 200 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10-15 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AMS journal Weather and Forecasting.

The accuracy of oil forecasts is a critical determinant of economic projections, hydrocarbon reserves estimation, construction of fluid processing facilities, and energy price fluctuations. Leveraging generative AI techniques, we model time series forecasting of oil and water productions across four multi-well sites spanning four decades. Our goal is to effectively model uncertainties and make precise forecasts to inform decision-making processes at the field scale. We utilize an autoregressive model known as TimeGrad and a variant of a transformer architecture named Informer, tailored specifically for forecasting long sequence time series data. Predictions from both TimeGrad and Informer closely align with the ground truth data. The overall performance of the Informer stands out, demonstrating greater efficiency compared to TimeGrad in forecasting oil production rates across all sites.</p></details> |  |

To date, neural network is considered the main machine learning tool for the financial prices prediction. Transfer Learning, as a method aimed at transferring knowledge from source tasks to target tasks, can represent a very useful methodological tool for getting better financial prediction capability. Current reviews on the above body of knowledge are mainly focused on neural network architectures, for financial prediction, with very little emphasis on the transfer learning methodology; thus, this paper is aimed at going deeper on this topic by developing a systematic review with respect to application of Transfer Learning for financial market predictions and to challenges/potential future directions of the transfer learning methodologies for stock market predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a preprint of a paper submitted to the 26th Irish Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (IMVIP 2024).

| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEADS-UP: Head-Mounted Egocentric Dataset for Trajectory Prediction in Blind Assistance Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20324v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce HEADS-UP, the first egocentric dataset collected from head-mounted cameras, designed specifically for trajectory prediction in blind assistance systems. With the growing population of blind and visually impaired individuals, the need for intelligent assistive tools that provide real-time warnings about potential collisions with dynamic obstacles is becoming critical. These systems rely on algorithms capable of predicting the trajectories of moving objects, such as pedestrians, to issue timely hazard alerts. However, existing datasets fail to capture the necessary information from the perspective of a blind individual. To address this gap, HEADS-UP offers a novel dataset focused on trajectory prediction in this context. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a semi-local trajectory prediction approach to assess collision risks between blind individuals and pedestrians in dynamic environments. Unlike conventional methods that separately predict the trajectories of both the blind individual (ego agent) and pedestrians, our approach operates within a semi-local coordinate system, a rotated version of the camera's coordinate system, facilitating the prediction process. We validate our method on the HEADS-UP dataset and implement the proposed solution in ROS, performing real-time tests on an NVIDIA Jetson GPU through a user study. Results from both dataset evaluations and live tests demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In the Violina framework, we optimize the coefficient matrices of state-space model and memory kernel in the given space using a projected gradient descent method so that its model prediction matches the set of multiple observed data. Using Violina we can identify a linear non-Markovian dynamical system with constraints corresponding to a priori knowledge on the model parameters and memory effects. Using synthetic data, we numerically demonstrate that the Markovian and non-Markovian state-space models identified by the proposed method have considerably better generalization performances compared to the models identified by an existing dynamic decomposition-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 18.9% to 23.4%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ACC 2025.

This paper proposes a suboptimal joint trajectory replanning (SJTR) method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of target orbit and flight trajectory after a fault within a convex optimization framework. By incorporating penalty coefficients for terminal constraints, the optimization solution adheres to the orbit redecision principle, thereby avoiding complex decision-making processes and resulting in a concise and rapid solution to the replanning problem. A learning-based warm-start scheme is proposed in conjunction with the designed SJTR method. Offline, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a dataset generated by the SJTR method. Online, the DNN provides initial guesses for the time optimization variables based on the current fault situation, enhancing the solving efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Numerical simulations of the MAV flight scenario under the thrust drop faults are performed, and Monte Carlo experiments and case studies across all orbit types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Planning of Minimum-time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16074v2)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Kinematic Detection of Anomalies in Human Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19136v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historically, much of the research in understanding, modeling, and mining human trajectory data has focused on where an individual stays. Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual "kinematic profile" which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline. This approach enhances efficient GPS data preparation and facilitates a deeper understanding of cycling behavior and the cycling environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Sustainable Urban Mobility (SUMob 2024)</p></details> |

Methods for trajectory classification are particularly important to detect different movement patterns, while methods for regression to compute motility metrics and forecasting. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the processing of trajectories rendered as images via artificial neural networks with 2d convolutional layers (CNNs). This approach leverages the capability of CNNs to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, necessary to recognize complex shapes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitation of other machine learning methods that require input trajectories with a fixed number of points. However, rendering trajectories as images can introduce poorly investigated artifacts such as information loss due to the plotting of coordinates on a discrete grid, and spectral changes due to line thickness and aliasing. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CNNs for solving classification and regression problems from synthetic trajectories that have been rendered as images using different modalities. The parameters considered in this study include line thickness, image resolution, usage of motion history (color-coding of the temporal component) and anti-aliasing. Results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate image resolution according to model depth and motion history in applications where movement direction is critical.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

They have complex dynamics, with many parameters that are difficult to identify and that change significantly based on the operating conditions. We propose a simple pseudo-kinematic model, where the intricate dynamic effects underlying the vehicle's motion are captured in a small set of velocity-dependent parameters. This choice enables the development of a Lyapunov-based trajectory controller with guaranteed performance and small computation time. We demonstrate the correctness of our approach with both simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper introduces BoT-Drive, a planning algorithm that addresses uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. BoT-Drive employs driver models to characterize unknown behavioral intentions and utilizes their model parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By also treating driver models as decision-making actions for the autonomous vehicle, BoT-Drive effectively tackles the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To enhance safety and robustness, the planner further applies importance sampling to refine the driving trajectory conditioned on the planned high-level behavior. Evaluation on real-world data shows that BoT-Drive consistently outperforms both existing planning methods and learning-based methods in regular and complex urban driving scenes, demonstrating significant improvements in driving safety and reliability.</p></details> |  |

Compared to urban structured roads, unstructured roads in mining sites have uneven boundaries and lack clearly defined lane markings. This leads to a lack of sufficient constraint information for predicting the trajectories of other human-driven vehicles, resulting in higher uncertainty in trajectory prediction problems. A method is proposed to predict multiple possible trajectories and their probabilities of the target vehicle. The surrounding environment and historical trajectories of the target vehicle are encoded as a rasterized image, which is used as input to our deep convolutional network to predict the target vehicle's multiple possible trajectories. The method underwent offline testing on a dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios in open-pit mining and was compared and evaluated against physics-based method.

Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |

However, due to the mobility of the vehicles and the limited computational resources for performing task offloading in near-real-time, such schemes may require high latency, thus, become even infeasible. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a Trajectory Prediction-based Pre-offloading Decision (TPPD) algorithm for analyzing the historical trajectories of vehicles to predict their future coordinates, thereby allowing for computational resource allocation in advance. We first utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict each vehicle's movement trajectory. Then, based on the task requirements and the predicted trajectories, we devise a dynamic resource allocation algorithm using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) that enables the edge server to minimize task processing delay, while ensuring effective utilization of the available computational resources. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing that, as compared with traditional real-time task offloading strategies, the proposed TPPD algorithm significantly reduces task processing delay while improving resource utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Trajectory Prediction via Coreset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

After training with this framework, the learned model can improve long-step prediction accuracy significantly given the past trajectories and the context information. The accuracy and effectiveness of the approach are evaluated by comparing the predicted trajectories with the ground truth. The results indicate that the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art predicting methods on a terminal airspace flight trajectory dataset. The trajectories generated by the proposed method have a higher temporal resolution(1 timestep per second vs 0.1 timestep per second) and are closer to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AIAA-JAIS</p></details> |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction describes the motions of surrounding moving obstacles for an autonomous vehicle; it plays a crucial role in enabling timely decision-making, such as collision avoidance and trajectory replanning. Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

| **[Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15182v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving, as it significantly affects vehicle behavior planning and control, thereby influencing traffic safety and efficiency. Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack</p></details> |

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, it is challenging for aircraft to sustain efficient air-ground communication in urban circumstances. Without continuous air-ground communication, aircraft may experience course deviation and safety accidents. To address these problems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-aided trajectory optimization scheme is proposed enabling efficient air-ground communication and safe aviation in UAM with a layered airspace structure. This paper first devises a dual-plane RIS communication scheme for layered airspace. It fully engages the omnidirectional and directional signal attributes to reduce the transmission delay of the air-ground communication. Based on the dual-plane RIS configuration, we jointly develop the intra- and inter-layer trajectory scheme to optimize communication and safe aviation. In the intra-layer trajectory optimization, we propose a dual-time-scale flight scheme to improve communication capacity and horizontal flight safety. Meanwhile, we propose a safe layer-switching method to ensure collision avoidance during vertical flight in the inter-layer trajectory optimization. The communication load of the proposed scheme can be improved 40% and the time of safe separation restoration can be lessened 66% compared with the benchmarks in the layered airspace.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In complex traffic scenarios, there are two significant issues with the current autonomous driving system: the cognitive uncertainty of prediction and the lack of risk awareness, which limit the further development of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model that incorporates insights and principles from driving behavior, ethical decision-making, and risk assessment. Based on joint prediction, our model consists of interaction, intention, and risk assessment modules. The dynamic variation of interaction between vehicles can be comprehensively captured at each timestamp in the interaction module. Based on interaction information, our model considers primary intentions for vehicles to enhance the diversity of trajectory generation. The optimization of predicted trajectories follows the advanced risk-aware decision-making principles. Experimental results are evaluated on the DeepAccident dataset; our approach shows its remarkable prediction performance on normal and accident scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 28.9\% and 26.5\%, respectively. The proposed model improves the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction in complex traffic scenarios.

| **[Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle+: Learning the Angle-based Conditioned Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14984v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect of understanding human behaviors. Researchers have made efforts to represent socially interactive behaviors among pedestrians and utilize various networks to enhance prediction capability. Unfortunately, they still face challenges not only in fully explaining and measuring how these interactive behaviors work to modify trajectories but also in modeling pedestrians' preferences to plan or participate in social interactions in response to the changeable physical environments as extra conditions. This manuscript mainly focuses on the above explainability and conditionality requirements for trajectory prediction networks. Inspired by marine animals perceiving other companions and the environment underwater by echolocation, this work constructs an angle-based conditioned social interaction representation SocialCircle+ to represent the socially interactive context and its corresponding conditions. It employs a social branch and a conditional branch to describe how pedestrians are positioned in prediction scenes socially and physically in angle-based-cyclic-sequence forms. Then, adaptive fusion is applied to fuse the above conditional clues onto the social ones to learn the final interaction representation. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of SocialCircle+ with different trajectory prediction backbones. Moreover, counterfactual interventions have been made to simultaneously verify the modeling capacity of causalities among interactive variables and the conditioning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

Our method leverages differentiable physics-based simulation to perform gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimized trajectory planning. By integrating fracture mechanics of adhesion, we are able to model the peeling effect inherent to dressing adhesion. The system is further guided by carefully designed objective functions that promote both efficient and safe control, reducing the risk of tissue damage. We validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic skin phantoms and real human subjects. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise and safe dressing removal trajectories, offering a promising solution for automating this essential healthcare procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11721v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Integrated Decision Making and Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Under Multimodal Uncertainties: A Bayesian Game Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13993v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interaction between traffic agents is a key issue in designing safe and non-conservative maneuvers in autonomous driving. This problem can be challenging when multi-modality and behavioral uncertainties are engaged. Existing methods either fail to plan interactively or consider unimodal behaviors that could lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, we introduce an integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework based on Bayesian game (i.e., game of incomplete information). Human decisions inherently exhibit discrete characteristics and therefore are modeled as types of players in the game. A general solver based on no-regret learning is introduced to obtain a corresponding Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, which captures the interaction between traffic agents in the multimodal context. With the attained equilibrium, decision-making and trajectory planning are performed simultaneously, and the resulting interactive strategy is shown to be optimal over the expectation of rivals' driving intentions. Closed-loop simulations on different traffic scenarios are performed to illustrate the generalizability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis of combined efficacy and safety outcomes for risk-benefit analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13946v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and effectively communicating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment is the basis of risk benefit analysis (RBA). More efficient and objective tools are needed. We apply Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) to perform RBA with superior objectivity, power, and clarity. We used CWTA to perform 1000-fold simulations of RCTs using ordinal endpoints for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. RCTs were simulated with 1:1 allocation at defined sample sizes and hazard ratios. We studied the simplest case of 3 levels each of toxicity and efficacy and the general case of the advanced cancer trial, with efficacy graded by five RECIST 1.1 health statuses and toxicity by the six-point CTCAE scale (6 x 5 matrix). The latter model was applied to a real-world dose escalation phase I trial in advanced cancer. Simulations in both the 3 x 3 and the 6 x 5 advanced cancer matrix confirmed that drugs with both superior efficacy and toxicity profiles synergize for greater statistical power with CWTA-RBA. The CWTA-RBA 6 x 5 matrix reduced sample size requirements over CWTA efficacy-only analysis. Application to the dose finding phase I clinical trial provided objective, statistically significant validation for the selected dose. CWTA-RBA, by incorporating both drug efficacy and toxicity, provides a single test statistic and plot that analyzes and effectively communicates therapeutic risks and benefits. CWTA-RBA requires fewer patients than CWTA efficacy-only analysis when the experimental drug is both more effective and less toxic. CWTA-RBA facilitates the objective and efficient assessment of new therapies throughout the drug development pathway. Furthermore, several advantages over competing tests in communicating risk-benefit will assist regulatory review, clinical adoption, and understanding of therapeutic risks and benefits by clinicians and patients alike.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The joint angles, the tool orientations and the manufacturing time-sequences are optimized simultaneously on input trajectories with large numbers of waypoints to improve the kinematic smoothness while incorporating the manufacturing constraints. Differently, existing methods always determine them in a decoupled manner. To deal with the large number of waypoints on a toolpath, we propose a decomposition based numerical scheme to optimize the trajectory in an out-of-core manner which can also run in parallel to improve the efficiency. Simulations and physical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method in examples of robot-assisted additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, the complexity of human mobility patterns is oversimplified by these similarities (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. Moreover, we also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to comprehensively assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-71.5% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Velocity Field: An Informative Traveling Cost Representation for Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13282v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involves generating a series of space points to be followed in the near future. However, due to the complex and uncertain nature of the driving environment, it is impractical for autonomous vehicles~(AVs) to exhaustively design planning rules for optimizing future trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a local map representation method called Velocity Field. This approach provides heading and velocity priors for trajectory planning tasks, simplifying the planning process in complex urban driving. The heading and velocity priors can be learned from demonstrations of human drivers using our proposed loss. Additionally, we developed an iterative sampling-based planner to train and compare the differences between local map representations. We investigated local map representation forms for planning performance on a real-world dataset. Compared to learned rasterized cost maps, our method demonstrated greater reliability and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |

However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistically Robust Trajectory Planning of Multiple Aerial Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12718v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on robust trajectory planning for autonomous agents aims to mitigate uncertainties arising from disturbances and modeling errors while ensuring guaranteed safety. Existing methods primarily utilize stochastic optimal control techniques with chance constraints to maintain a minimum distance among agents with a guaranteed probability. However, these approaches face challenges, such as the use of simplifying assumptions that result in linear system models or Gaussian disturbances, which limit their practicality in complex realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, this work introduces a novel probabilistically robust distributed controller enabling autonomous agents to plan safe trajectories, even under non-Gaussian uncertainty and nonlinear systems. Leveraging exact uncertainty propagation techniques based on mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation, this method transforms non-Gaussian chance constraints into deterministic ones, seamlessly integrating them into a distributed model predictive control framework solvable with standard optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, highlighting its ability to consistently handle various types of uncertainty, ensuring robust and accurate path planning in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2024)</p></details> |

Arguably, the maritime domain lags behind, as ships operate on many more degrees of freedom (thus, a much larger search space): there is less physical infrastructure, and rules are less consistent and constraining than what is found on roads. The problem is further complicated by the inevitable co-existence of autonomous and human-operated ships: the latter may take unpredictable decisions, which require adjustments on the autonomous ones. Finally, the problem is inherently decentralised, there is no central authority, and communication means can be very diverse in terms of communication distance and performance, mandating special care on which information is shared and how. In this work, we elaborate on the challenges of trajectory prediction and adaptation for mixed autonomous and human-operated ships, and we propose initial ideas on potential approaches to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SISSY 2024</p></details> |

As opposed to the standard method of uniformly sampling control inputs (which lead to biased samples of the configuration space), C-Uniform trajectories are generated by control actions which lead to uniform sampling of the configuration space. After presenting an intuitive closed-form solution to generate C-Uniform trajectories for the 1D random-walker, we present a network-flow based optimization method to precompute C-Uniform trajectories for general robot systems. We apply the notion of C-Uniformity to the design of Model Predictive Path Integral controllers. Through simulation experiments, we show that using C-Uniform trajectories significantly improves the performance of MPPI-style controllers, achieving up to 40% coverage performance gain compared to the best baseline. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with an implementation on a 1/10th scale racer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Anomaly Detection with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15366v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis. Our results demonstrate UAVDB's potential as a critical resource for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

In the existing literatures, All-Wheel-Steering (AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibit inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates non-linearity characteristics, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS (C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by iROS 2024</p></details> |

Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results.

This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From a Single Trajectory to Safety Controller Synthesis of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Polynomial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10026v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work is concerned with developing a data-driven approach for learning control barrier certificates (CBCs) and associated safety controllers for discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems with unknown mathematical models, guaranteeing system safety over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[xTED: Cross-Domain Policy Adaptation via Diffusion-Based Trajectory Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08687v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reusing pre-collected data from different domains is an attractive solution in decision-making tasks where the accessible data is insufficient in the target domain but relatively abundant in other related domains. Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

One of the main reasons is the computationally long planning times that come with a large state space. Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Structured Deep Neural Network-Based Backstepping Trajectory Tracking Control for Lagrangian Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00381v3)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly being used to learn controllers due to their excellent approximation capabilities. However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to replan folding trajectory at every time step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from geometric features. These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths. Our experiments demonstrate AdaFold's ability to adapt folding trajectories of cloths with varying physical properties and generalize from simulated training to real-world execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diff-RNTraj: A Structure-aware Diffusion Model for Road Network-constrained Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07369v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is essential for various applications as it records the movement of vehicles. However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, \emph{i.e.}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Joint trajectory and network inference via reference fitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06879v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network inference, the task of reconstructing interactions in a complex system from experimental observables, is a central yet extremely challenging problem in systems biology. While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from time-stamped single cell snapshots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Geo-Llama: Leveraging LLMs for Human Mobility Trajectory Generation with Spatiotemporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13918v3)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating human mobility data is essential for various application domains, including transportation, urban planning, and epidemic control, since real data are often inaccessible to researchers due to expensive costs and privacy issues. Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v5)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main part of this manuscript (except the part on DRE) has been accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshop HALF-CENTURY OF STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (50SFM)</p></details> |

The rapid increase of functional glycan data provides a good opportunity for machine learning solutions to glycan understanding. However, there still lacks a standard machine learning benchmark for glycan property and function prediction. In this work, we fill this blank by building a comprehensive benchmark for Glycan Machine Learning (GlycanML). The GlycanML benchmark consists of diverse types of tasks including glycan taxonomy prediction, glycan immunogenicity prediction, glycosylation type prediction, and protein-glycan interaction prediction. Glycans can be represented by both sequences and graphs in GlycanML, which enables us to extensively evaluate sequence-based models and graph neural networks (GNNs) on benchmark tasks. Furthermore, by concurrently performing eight glycan taxonomy prediction tasks, we introduce the GlycanML-MTL testbed for multi-task learning (MTL) algorithms. Also, we evaluate how taxonomy prediction can boost other three function prediction tasks by MTL. Experimental results show the superiority of modeling glycans with multi-relational GNNs, and suitable MTL methods can further boost model performance.

| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |
| **[Subgraph Clustering and Atom Learning for Improved Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14772v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present the Graph Sub-Graph Network (GSN), a novel hybrid image classification model merging the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for structural modeling. GSN employs k-means clustering to group graph nodes into clusters, facilitating the creation of subgraphs. These subgraphs are then utilized to learn representative `atoms` for dictionary learning, enabling the identification of sparse, class-distinguishable features. This integrated approach is particularly relevant in domains like medical imaging, where discerning subtle feature differences is crucial for accurate classification. To evaluate the performance of our proposed GSN, we conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, including PascalVOC and HAM10000. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our model in optimizing dictionary configurations across varied classes, which contributes to its effectiveness in medical classification tasks. This performance enhancement is primarily attributed to the integration of CNNs, GNNs, and graph learning techniques, which collectively improve the handling of datasets with limited labeled examples. Specifically, our experiments show that the model achieves a higher accuracy on benchmark datasets such as Pascal VOC and HAM10000 compared to conventional CNN approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Signed Propagation for Graph Neural Networks in Multi-Class Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08918v7)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which collect information from adjacent nodes achieve dismal performance on heterophilic graphs. Various schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, and propagating signed information on heterophilic edges has gained great attention. Recently, some works provided theoretical analysis that signed propagation always leads to performance improvement under a binary class scenario. However, we notice that prior analyses do not align well with multi-class benchmark datasets. This paper provides a new understanding of signed propagation for multi-class scenarios and points out two drawbacks in terms of message-passing and parameter update: (1) Message-passing: if two nodes belong to different classes but have a high similarity, signed propagation can decrease the separability. (2) Parameter update: the prediction uncertainty (e.g., conflict evidence) of signed neighbors increases during training, which can impede the stability of the algorithm. Based on the observation, we introduce two novel strategies for improving signed propagation under multi-class graphs. The proposed scheme combines calibration to secure robustness while reducing uncertainty. We show the efficacy of our theorem through extensive experiments on six benchmark graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. These works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a novel perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. More specifically, the strict injective and metric requirements are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. A mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and widely used GNNs is then laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets then demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

These rules can be exploited to optimize the structure of ZX-diagrams for a range of applications. However, finding an optimal sequence of transformation rules is generally an open problem. In this work, we bring together ZX-diagrams with reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique designed to discover an optimal sequence of actions in a decision-making problem and show that a trained reinforcement learning agent can significantly outperform other optimization techniques like a greedy strategy, simulated annealing, and state-of-the-art hand-crafted algorithms.

The problem forms an essential building block for multi-robot systems in applications such as exploration, surveillance, and transportation. We address this problem in a decentralized setting where each robot knows only the positions of its $k$-nearest robots and $k$-nearest targets. This scenario combines elements of combinatorial assignment and continuous-space motion planning, posing significant scalability challenges for traditional centralized approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a decentralized policy learned via a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN enables robots to determine (1) what information to communicate to neighbors and (2) how to integrate received information with local observations for decision-making. We train the GNN using imitation learning with the centralized Hungarian algorithm as the expert policy, and further fine-tune it using reinforcement learning to avoid collisions and enhance performance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The GNN policy trained on 100 robots generalizes to scenarios with up to 500 robots, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by 8.6\% on average and significantly surpassing greedy decentralized methods.

However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of CGNN.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Survey on Graph Neural Networks for Remaining Useful Life Prediction: Methodologies, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19629v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a critical aspect of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), aimed at predicting the future state of a system to enable timely maintenance and prevent unexpected failures. While existing deep learning methods have shown promise, they often struggle to fully leverage the spatial information inherent in complex systems, limiting their effectiveness in RUL prediction. To address this challenge, recent research has explored the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model spatial information for more accurate RUL prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GNN techniques applied to RUL prediction, summarizing existing methods and offering guidance for future research. We first propose a novel taxonomy based on the stages of adapting GNNs to RUL prediction, systematically categorizing approaches into four key stages: graph construction, graph modeling, graph information processing, and graph readout. By organizing the field in this way, we highlight the unique challenges and considerations at each stage of the GNN pipeline. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation of various state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN methods, ensuring consistent experimental settings for fair comparisons. This rigorous analysis yields valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, serving as an experimental guide for researchers and practitioners working in this area. Finally, we identify and discuss several promising research directions that could further advance the field, emphasizing the potential for GNNs to revolutionize RUL prediction and enhance the effectiveness of PHM strategies.

While Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have advanced, they face challenges like graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles. The authors propose using data augmentation (DA) techniques to address these issues, although many existing methods are not suitable for signed graphs due to a lack of side information. They highlight that the random DropEdge method, a rare DA approach applicable to signed graphs, does not enhance link sign prediction performance. In response, they introduce the Signed Graph Augmentation (SGA) framework, which includes a structure augmentation module to identify candidate edges and a strategy for selecting beneficial candidates, ultimately improving SGNN training. Experimental results show that SGA significantly boosts the performance of SGNN models, with a notable 32.3% improvement in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[DuoGNN: Topology-aware Graph Neural Network with Homophily and Heterophily Interaction-Decoupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19616v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in various medical imaging applications, such as automated disease diagnosis. However, due to the local neighborhood aggregation paradigm in message passing which characterizes these models, they inherently suffer from two fundamental limitations: first, indistinguishable node embeddings due to heterophilic node aggregation (known as over-smoothing), and second, impaired message passing due to aggregation through graph bottlenecks (known as over-squashing). These challenges hinder the model expressiveness and prevent us from using deeper models to capture long-range node dependencies within the graph. Popular solutions in the literature are either too expensive to process large graphs due to high time complexity or do not generalize across all graph topologies. To address these limitations, we propose DuoGNN, a scalable and generalizable architecture which leverages topology to decouple homophilic and heterophilic edges and capture both short-range and long-range interactions. Our three core contributions introduce (i) a topological edge-filtering algorithm which extracts homophilic interactions and enables the model to generalize well for any graph topology, (ii) a heterophilic graph condensation technique which extracts heterophilic interactions and ensures scalability, and (iii) a dual homophilic and heterophilic aggregation pipeline which prevents over-smoothing and over-squashing during the message passing. We benchmark our model on medical and non-medical node classification datasets and compare it with its variants, showing consistent improvements across all tasks. Our DuoGNN code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/DuoGNN.</p></details> |  |

Among the various tools employed in malware detection, graph representations (e.g., function call graphs) have played a pivotal role in characterizing the behaviors of Android apps. However, though achieving impressive performance in malware detection, current state-of-the-art graph-based malware detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. These adversarial examples are meticulously crafted by introducing specific perturbations to normal malicious inputs. To defend against adversarial attacks, existing defensive mechanisms are typically supplementary additions to detectors and exhibit significant limitations, often relying on prior knowledge of adversarial examples and failing to defend against unseen types of attacks effectively. In this paper, we propose MASKDROID, a powerful detector with a strong discriminative ability to identify malware and remarkable robustness against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce a masking mechanism into the Graph Neural Network (GNN) based framework, forcing MASKDROID to recover the whole input graph using a small portion (e.g., 20%) of randomly selected nodes.This strategy enables the model to understand the malicious semantics and learn more stable representations, enhancing its robustness against adversarial attacks. While capturing stable malicious semantics in the form of dependencies inside the graph structures, we further employ a contrastive module to encourage MASKDROID to learn more compact representations for both the benign and malicious classes to boost its discriminative power in detecting malware from benign apps and adversarial examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Node Per User: Node-Level Federated Learning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19513v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) training often necessitates gathering raw user data on a central server, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated learning emerges as a solution, enabling collaborative model training without users directly sharing their raw data. However, integrating federated learning with GNNs presents unique challenges, especially when a client represents a graph node and holds merely a single feature vector. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for node-level federated graph learning. Specifically, we decouple the message-passing and feature vector transformation processes of the first GNN layer, allowing them to be executed separately on the user devices and the cloud server. Moreover, we introduce a graph Laplacian term based on the feature vector's latent representation to regulate the user-side model updates. The experiment results on multiple datasets show that our approach achieves better performance compared with baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined random walk with unifying memory (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node. Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test. On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation for Message Passing Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19414v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) have emerged as the preferred method for modeling complex interactions across diverse graph entities. While the theory of such models is well understood, their aggregation module has not received sufficient attention. Sum-based aggregators have solid theoretical foundations regarding their separation capabilities. However, practitioners often prefer using more complex aggregations and mixtures of diverse aggregations. In this work, we unveil a possible explanation for this gap. We claim that sum-based aggregators fail to "mix" features belonging to distinct neighbors, preventing them from succeeding at downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation (SSMA), a novel plug-and-play aggregation for MPGNNs. SSMA treats the neighbor features as 2D discrete signals and sequentially convolves them, inherently enhancing the ability to mix features attributed to distinct neighbors. By performing extensive experiments, we show that when combining SSMA with well-established MPGNN architectures, we achieve substantial performance gains across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in many settings. We published our code at \url{https://almogdavid.github.io/SSMA/}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Furthermore, the extension of machine learning to quantum computers has given rise to the emerging field of quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Complete Graph Neural Network (QCGNN), which is a variational quantum algorithm based model designed for learning on complete graphs. QCGNN with deep parametrized operators offers a polynomial speedup over its classical and quantum counterparts, leveraging the property of quantum parallelism. We investigate the application of QCGNN with the challenging task of jet discrimination, where the jets are represented as complete graphs. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis with classical models to establish a performance benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[TwinCL: A Twin Graph Contrastive Learning Model for Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19169v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of recommendation and collaborative filtering, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become an influential approach. Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of contrastive learning are still not well understood. In this paper, we challenge the conventional use of random augmentations on graph structure or embedding space in GCL, which may disrupt the structural and semantic information inherent in Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, fixed-rate data augmentation proves to be less effective compared to augmentation with an adaptive rate. In the initial training phases, significant perturbations are more suitable, while as the training approaches convergence, milder perturbations yield better results. We introduce a twin encoder in place of random augmentations, demonstrating the redundancy of traditional augmentation techniques. The twin encoder updating mechanism ensures the generation of more diverse contrastive views in the early stages, transitioning to views with greater similarity as training progresses. In addition, we investigate the learned representations from the perspective of alignment and uniformity on a hypersphere to optimize more efficiently. Our proposed Twin Graph Contrastive Learning model -- TwinCL -- aligns positive pairs of user and item embeddings and the representations from the twin encoder while maintaining the uniformity of the embeddings on the hypersphere. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed model optimizing alignment and uniformity with the twin encoder contributes to better recommendation accuracy and training efficiency performance. In comprehensive experiments on three public datasets, our proposed TwinCL achieves an average improvement of 5.6% (NDCG@10) in recommendation accuracy with faster training speed, while effectively mitigating popularity bias.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLapGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

However, they often fail to produce calibrated predictive distributions, limiting their effectiveness for uncertainty quantification. We introduce the Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Network (PE-GQNN), a novel method that integrates PE-GNNs, Quantile Neural Networks, and recalibration techniques in a fully nonparametric framework, requiring minimal assumptions about the predictive distributions. We propose a new network architecture that, when combined with a quantile-based loss function, yields accurate and reliable probabilistic models without increasing computational complexity. Our approach provides a flexible, robust framework for conditional density estimation, applicable beyond spatial data contexts. We further introduce a structured method for incorporating a KNN predictor into the model while avoiding data leakage through the GNN layer operation. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PE-GQNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 ma...</summary><p>17 main text pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Recently, the advent of deep learning methods has introduced significant potential for enhancing SAT solving. However, a major barrier to the advancement of this field has been the scarcity of large, realistic datasets. The majority of current public datasets are either randomly generated or extremely limited, containing only a few examples from unrelated problem families. These datasets are inadequate for meaningful training of deep learning methods. In light of this, researchers have started exploring generative techniques to create data that more accurately reflect SAT problems encountered in practical situations. These methods have so far suffered from either the inability to produce challenging SAT problems or time-scalability obstacles. In this paper we address both by identifying and manipulating the key contributors to a problem's ``hardness'', known as cores. Although some previous work has addressed cores, the time costs are unacceptably high due to the expense of traditional heuristic core detection techniques. We introduce a fast core detection procedure that uses a graph neural network. Our empirical results demonstrate that we can efficiently generate problems that remain hard to solve and retain key attributes of the original example problems. We show via experiment that the generated synthetic SAT problems can be used in a data augmentation setting to provide improved prediction of solver runtimes.</p></details> |  |

Of particular concern is the phenomenon of intrinsic alignments (IA), whereby galaxies orient themselves towards overdensities, potentially introducing significant systematic biases in weak gravitational lensing analyses if they are not properly modeled. Due to computational constraints, simulating the intricate details of galaxy formation and evolution relevant to IA across vast volumes is impractical. As an alternative, we propose a Deep Generative Model trained on the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation to sample 3D galaxy shapes and orientations to accurately reproduce intrinsic alignments along with correlated scalar features. We model the cosmic web as a set of graphs, each graph representing a halo with nodes representing the subhalos/galaxies. The architecture consists of a SO(3) $\times$ $\mathbb{R}^n$ diffusion generative model, for galaxy orientations and $n$ scalars, implemented with E(3) equivariant Graph Neural Networks that explicitly respect the Euclidean symmetries of our Universe. The model is able to learn and predict features such as galaxy orientations that are statistically consistent with the reference simulation. Notably, our model demonstrates the ability to jointly model Euclidean-valued scalars (galaxy sizes, shapes, and colors) along with non-Euclidean valued SO(3) quantities (galaxy orientations) that are governed by highly complex galactic physics at non-linear scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures. submitted to MNRAS</p></details> |

This paper investigates the critical role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the management of digital assets and introduces innovative unlearning techniques specifically tailored to GNN architectures. We categorize unlearning strategies into two primary classes: data-driven approximation, which manipulates the graph structure to isolate and remove the influence of specific nodes, and model-driven approximation, which modifies the internal parameters and architecture of the GNN itself. By examining recent advancements in these unlearning methodologies, we highlight their applicability in various use cases, including fraud detection, risk assessment, token relationship prediction, and decentralized governance. We discuss the challenges inherent in balancing model performance with the requirements for data unlearning, particularly in the context of real-time financial applications. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both unlearning strategies to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of GNNs in digital asset ecosystems. Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing GNN unlearning techniques, paving the way for secure and compliant deployment of machine learning in the digital asset domain.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel embedding update mechanism, Structure-aware Embedding Evolution (SEvo for short), to encourage related nodes to evolve similarly at each step. Unlike GNN (Graph Neural Network) that typically serves as an intermediate module, SEvo is able to directly inject graph structural information into embedding with minimal computational overhead during training. The convergence properties of SEvo along with its potential variants are theoretically analyzed to justify the validity of the designs. Moreover, SEvo can be seamlessly integrated into existing optimizers for state-of-the-art performance. Particularly SEvo-enhanced AdamW with moment estimate correction demonstrates consistent improvements across a spectrum of models and datasets, suggesting a novel technical route to effectively utilize graph structural information beyond explicit GNN modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We present a framework for distributed computation over a quantum network in which data is encoded into specialized quantum states. We prove that for models within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent can be performed with exponentially less communication compared to their classical analogs, and with relatively modest overhead relative to standard gradient-based methods. We show that certain graph neural networks are particularly amenable to implementation within this framework, and moreover present empirical evidence that they perform well on standard benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first example of exponential quantum advantage for a generic class of machine learning problems that hold regardless of the data encoding cost. Moreover, we show that models in this class can encode highly nonlinear features of their inputs, and their expressivity increases exponentially with model depth. We also delineate the space of models for which exponential communication advantages hold by showing that they cannot hold for linear classification. Our results can be combined with natural privacy advantages in the communicated quantum states that limit the amount of information that can be extracted from them about the data and model parameters. Taken as a whole, these findings form a promising foundation for distributed machine learning over quantum networks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, our goal is to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of using a causality-based approach for fMRI fingerprinting. Specifically, we propose an innovative method that utilizes the causal dynamics activities of the brain to identify the unique cognitive patterns of individuals (e.g., subject fingerprint) and fMRI tasks (e.g., task fingerprint). The key novelty of our approach stems from the development of a two-timescale linear state-space model to extract 'spatio-temporal' (aka causal) signatures from an individual's fMRI time series data. To the best of our knowledge, we pioneer and subsequently quantify, in this paper, the concept of 'causal fingerprint.' Our method is well-separated from other fingerprint studies as we quantify fingerprints from a cause-and-effect perspective, which are then incorporated with a modal decomposition and projection method to perform subject identification and a GNN-based (Graph Neural Network) model to perform task identification. Finally, we show that the experimental results and comparisons with non-causality-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We visualize the obtained causal signatures and discuss their biological relevance in light of the existing understanding of brain functionalities. Collectively, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

ISAC beamforming design in cell-free massive MIMO systems, compared to colocated MIMO systems, is more challenging due to the additional complexity of the distributed large number of access points (APs). To address this problem, this paper first shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) are a suitable machine learning framework. Then, it develops a novel heterogeneous GNN model inspired by the specific characteristics of the cell-free ISAC MIMO systems. This model enables the low-complexity scaling of the cell-free ISAC system and does not require full retraining when additional APs are added or removed. Our results show that the proposed architecture can achieve near-optimal performance, and applies well to various network structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE SPAWC 2024.

| **[UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without needing expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods with divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the divide or the conquer procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</p></details> |  |

In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in predicting spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message passing mechanism in GNNs limits the model's representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a cell-embedded GNN model (aka CeGNN) to learn spatiotemporal dynamics with lifted performance. Specifically, we introduce a learnable cell attribution to the node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from the first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume to edge and then to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the performance of CeGNN and relieve the over-smoothness problem, via treating the latent features as basis functions. The extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baseline models, particularly reducing the prediction error with up to 1 orders of magnitude on several PDE systems.</p></details> |  |

However, in a dynamic context, by interconnecting all nodes at multiple snapshots with self-attention, GT loose both structural and temporal information. In this work, we introduce Supra-LAplacian encoding for spatio-temporal TransformErs (SLATE), a new spatio-temporal encoding to leverage the GT architecture while keeping spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we transform Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs into multi-layer graphs and take advantage of the spectral properties of their associated supra-Laplacian matrix. Our second contribution explicitly model nodes' pairwise relationships with a cross-attention mechanism, providing an accurate edge representation for dynamic link prediction. SLATE outperforms numerous state-of-the-art methods based on Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks combined with recurrent models (e.g LSTM), and Dynamic Graph Transformers, on 9 datasets. Code and instructions to reproduce our results will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Point sets with small discrepancy are called low-discrepancy and are known to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. Low-discrepancy points play a central role in many problems in science and engineering, including numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. In this work, we present the first machine learning approach to generate a new class of low-discrepancy point sets named Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) points. Motivated by the geometric nature of generating low-discrepancy point sets, we leverage tools from Geometric Deep Learning and base our model on Graph Neural Networks. We further provide an extension of our framework to higher dimensions, which flexibly allows the generation of custom-made points that emphasize the uniformity in specific dimensions that are primarily important for the particular problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance superior to previous methods by a significant margin. In fact, MPMC points are empirically shown to be either optimal or near-optimal with respect to the discrepancy for low dimension and small number of points, i.e., for which the optimal discrepancy can be determined.

In this field, table rows are usually treated as independent data samples, but additional information about relations between them is sometimes available and can be used to improve predictive performance. Such information can be naturally modeled with a graph, thus tabular machine learning may benefit from graph machine learning methods. However, graph machine learning models are typically evaluated on datasets with homogeneous node features, which have little in common with heterogeneous mixtures of numerical and categorical features present in tabular datasets. Thus, there is a critical difference between the data used in tabular and graph machine learning studies, which does not allow one to understand how successfully graph models can be transferred to tabular data. To bridge this gap, we propose a new benchmark of diverse graphs with heterogeneous tabular node features and realistic prediction tasks. We use this benchmark to evaluate a vast set of models, including simple methods previously overlooked in the literature. Our experiments show that graph neural networks (GNNs) can indeed often bring gains in predictive performance for tabular data, but standard tabular models also can be adapted to work with graph data by using simple feature preprocessing, which sometimes enables them to compete with and even outperform GNNs. Based on our empirical study, we provide insights for researchers and practitioners in both tabular and graph machine learning fields.</p></details> |  |

Mapping an event on web to the popularity score plays a pivot role to sense the social trends from the cyberspace. However, the complex semantic correspondence between texts and images, as well as the implicit text-image-popularity mapping mechanics pose a significant challenge to this non-trivial task. In this paper, we address this problem from a viewpoint of understanding the interpretable mapping mechanics. Concretely, we organize the keywords from different events into an unified graph. The unified graph facilitates to model the popularity of events via two-level mappings, i.e., the self excitation and the mutual excitation. The self-excitation assumes that each keyword forms the popularity while the mutual-excitation models that two keywords would excite each other to determine the popularity of an event. Specifically, we use Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the backbone to model the self-excitation, the mutual excitation and the context of images into a sparse and deep factor model. Besides, to our best knowledge, we release a challenge web event dataset for the popularity prediction task. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

The primary challenge involves understanding and reconstructing how hands and objects interact, such as contact and physical plausibility. Existing approaches often adopt a graph neural network to incorporate spatial information of hand and object meshes. However, these approaches have not fully exploited the potential of graphs without modification of edges within and between hand- and object-graphs. We propose a graph-based refinement method that incorporates an interaction-aware graph-attention mechanism to account for hand-object interactions. Using edges, we establish connections among closely correlated nodes, both within individual graphs and across different graphs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with notable improvements in the realm of physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted by ICIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Convolutional Signal Propagation: A Simple Scalable Algorithm for Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17628v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Last decade has seen the emergence of numerous methods for learning on graphs, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). These methods, however, are often not directly applicable to more complex structures like bipartite graphs (equivalent to hypergraphs), which represent interactions among two entity types (e.g. a user liking a movie). This paper proposes Convolutional Signal Propagation (CSP), a non-parametric simple and scalable method that natively operates on bipartite graphs (hypergraphs) and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. After defining CSP, we demonstrate its relationship with well-established methods like label propagation, Naive Bayes, and Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. We evaluate CSP against several reference methods on real-world datasets from multiple domains, focusing on retrieval and classification tasks. Our results show that CSP offers competitive performance while maintaining low computational complexity, making it an ideal first choice as a baseline for hypergraph node classification and retrieval. Moreover, despite operating on hypergraphs, CSP achieves good results in tasks typically not associated with hypergraphs, such as natural language processing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Heterogeneous Hyper-Graph Neural Networks for Context-aware Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17483v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (CHAR) is challenging due to the need to recognize the user's current activity from signals that vary significantly with contextual factors such as phone placements and the varied styles with which different users perform the same activity. In this paper, we argue that context-aware activity visit patterns in realistic in-the-wild data can equivocally be considered as a general graph representation learning task. We posit that exploiting underlying graphical patterns in CHAR data can improve CHAR task performance and representation learning. Building on the intuition that certain activities are frequently performed with the phone placed in certain positions, we focus on the context-aware human activity problem of recognizing the <Activity, Phone Placement> tuple. We demonstrate that CHAR data has an underlying graph structure that can be viewed as a heterogenous hypergraph that has multiple types of nodes and hyperedges (an edge connecting more than two nodes). Subsequently, learning <Activity, Phone Placement> representations becomes a graph node representation learning problem. After task transformation, we further propose a novel Heterogeneous HyperGraph Neural Network architecture for Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HHGNN-CHAR), with three types of heterogeneous nodes (user, phone placement, and activity). Connections between all types of nodes are represented by hyperedges. Rigorous evaluation demonstrated that on an unscripted, in-the-wild CHAR dataset, our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines including CHAR models that do not exploit graphs, and GNN variants that do not incorporate heterogeneous nodes or hyperedges with overall improvements 14.04% on Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and 7.01% on Macro F1 scores.</p></details> | PerCom 2023 |

While the challenges of applying GNNs for node classification when class labels display strong heterophily are well understood, it is unclear how heterophily affects GNN performance in other important graph learning tasks where class labels are not available. In this work, we focus on the link prediction task and systematically analyze the impact of heterophily in node features on GNN performance. Theoretically, we first introduce formal definitions of homophilic and heterophilic link prediction tasks, and present a theoretical framework that highlights the different optimizations needed for the respective tasks. We then analyze how different link prediction encoders and decoders adapt to varying levels of feature homophily and introduce designs for improved performance. Our empirical analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets confirms our theoretical insights and highlights the importance of adopting learnable decoders and GNN encoders with ego- and neighbor-embedding separation in message passing for link prediction tasks beyond homophily.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Despite significant efforts made for graph neural network (GNN) techniques, their focus on graph nodes makes the state-of-the-art GNN methods not suitable for classifying brain connectivity as graphs where the objective is to characterize disease-relevant network dysfunction patterns on graph links. To address this issue, we propose Multi-resolution Edge Network (MENET) to detect disease-specific connectomic benchmarks with high discrimination power across diagnostic categories. The core of MENET is a novel graph edge-wise transform that we propose, which allows us to capture multi-resolution ``connectomic'' features. Using a rich set of the connectomic features, we devise a graph learning framework to jointly select discriminative edges and assign diagnostic labels for graphs. Experiments on two real datasets show that MENET accurately predicts diagnostic labels and identify brain connectivities highly associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Covert Communication Against Multi-UAV Surveillance Using Graph Koopman Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17048v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low Probability of Detection (LPD) communication aims to obscure the presence of radio frequency (RF) signals to evade surveillance. In the context of mobile surveillance utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), achieving LPD communication presents significant challenges due to the UAVs' rapid and continuous movements, which are characterized by unknown nonlinear dynamics. Therefore, accurately predicting future locations of UAVs is essential for enabling real-time LPD communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework termed predictive covert communication, aimed at minimizing detectability in terrestrial ad-hoc networks under multi-UAV surveillance. Our data-driven method synergistically integrates graph neural networks (GNN) with Koopman theory to model the complex interactions within a multi-UAV network and facilitating long-term predictions by linearizing the dynamics, even with limited historical data. Extensive simulation results substantiate that the predicted trajectories using our method result in at least 63%-75% lower probability of detection when compared to well-known state-of-the-art baseline approaches, showing promise in enabling low-latency covert operations in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As such, they share the inherent limitations and problems of deep learning, especially regarding the issues of explainability and trustworthiness. We propose $\mu\mathcal{G}$, an original domain-specific language for the specification of graph neural networks that aims to overcome these issues. The language's syntax is introduced, and its meaning is rigorously defined by a denotational semantics. An equivalent characterization in the form of an operational semantics is also provided and, together with a type system, is used to prove the type soundness of $\mu\mathcal{G}$. We show how $\mu\mathcal{G}$ programs can be represented in a more user-friendly graphical visualization, and provide examples of its generality by showing how it can be used to define some of the most popular graph neural network models, or to develop any custom graph processing application.</p></details> |  |

SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSR-IGRU: Stock Trend Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Relationships and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08282v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods. Our sources are released at https://github.com/ZP1481616577/Baselines_LSR-IGRU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-backtracking Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07430v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The celebrated message-passing updates for graph neural networks allow representing large-scale graphs with local and computationally tractable updates. However, the updates suffer from backtracking, i.e., a message flowing through the same edge twice and revisiting the previously visited node. Since the number of message flows increases exponentially with the number of updates, the redundancy in local updates prevents the graph neural network from accurately recognizing a particular message flow relevant for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose to resolve such a redundancy issue via the non-backtracking graph neural network (NBA-GNN) that updates a message without incorporating the message from the previously visited node. We theoretically investigate how NBA-GNN alleviates the over-squashing of GNNs, and establish a connection between NBA-GNN and the impressive performance of non-backtracking updates for stochastic block model recovery. Furthermore, we empirically verify the effectiveness of our NBA-GNN on the long-range graph benchmark and transductive node classification problems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph unlearning techniques often necessitate additional training on the remaining data, leading to significant computational costs, particularly with large-scale graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training-free approach, Erase then Rectify (ETR), designed for efficient and scalable graph unlearning while preserving the model utility. Specifically, we first build a theoretical foundation showing that masking parameters critical for unlearned samples enables effective unlearning. Building on this insight, the Erase stage strategically edits model parameters to eliminate the impact of unlearned samples and their propagated influence on intercorrelated nodes. To further ensure the GNN's utility, the Rectify stage devises a gradient approximation method to estimate the model's gradient on the remaining dataset, which is then used to enhance model performance. Overall, ETR achieves graph unlearning without additional training or full training data access, significantly reducing computational overhead and preserving data privacy. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of ETR in model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning effectiveness, establishing it as a promising solution for real-world graph unlearning challenges.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite their versatility, GNNs face significant challenges in transferability, limiting their utility in real-world applications. Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooks discrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challenges when transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt a well-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural distributions remains an under-explored problem. Taking inspiration from the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in adapting large language models to various domains, we propose GraphLoRA, an effective and parameter-efficient method for transferring well-trained GNNs to diverse graph domains. Specifically, we first propose a Structure-aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy (SMMD) to align divergent node feature distributions across source and target graphs. Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a small trainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structural distribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a structure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance the adaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervision labels. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphLoRA against eleven baselines by tuning only 20% of parameters, even across disparate graph domains. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphLoRA.</p></details> | Under review |

However, these approaches adhere to two distinct yet complementary problem formulations: ranking score regression based on query-webpage pairs, and link prediction within query-webpage bipartite graphs, respectively. While it is possible to pre-train GNNs or Transformers on source datasets and subsequently fine-tune them on sparsely annotated LTR datasets, the distributional shifts between the pair-based and bipartite graph domains present significant challenges in integrating these heterogeneous models into a unified LTR framework at web scale. To address this, we introduce the novel MPGraf model, which leverages a modular and capsule-based pre-training strategy, aiming to cohesively integrate the regression capabilities of Transformers with the link prediction strengths of GNNs. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments to rigorously evaluate the performance of MPGraf.</p></details> |  |

Our model combines graph neural networks and Gaussian processes to create a flexible, efficient, symmetry-aware, translation, and rotation-invariant predictor with inbuilt uncertainty quantification. This predictor is then used as a surrogate for a data-efficient Bayesian Optimization scheme to determine the optimal adsorption positions. This pipeline determines the optimal position of large and complicated clusters with far fewer iterations than current state-of-the-art approaches. Further, it does not rely on hand-crafted features and can be seamlessly employed on any molecule without any alterations. Additionally, the pooling properties of graphs allow for the processing of molecules of different sizes by the same model. This allows the energy prediction of computationally demanding systems by a model trained on comparatively smaller and less expensive ones</p></details> | 17 pages 8 figures |

In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Massive Activations of Attention Mechanism in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03463v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for effectively modeling data with graph structures. Recently, attention mechanisms have been integrated into GNNs to improve their ability to capture complex patterns. This paper presents the first comprehensive study revealing a critical, unexplored consequence of this integration: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. We introduce a novel method for detecting and analyzing MAs, focusing on edge features in different graph transformer architectures. Our study assesses various GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs based on activation ratio distributions, (3) introducing the Explicit Bias Term (EBT) as a potential countermeasure and exploring it as an adversarial framework to assess models robustness based on the presence or absence of MAs. Our findings highlight the prevalence and impact of attention-induced MAs across different architectures, such as GraphTransformer, GraphiT, and SAN. The study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, model architecture, dataset characteristics, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for developing more robust and reliable graph models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetries and Expressive Requirements for Learning General Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15892v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State symmetries play an important role in planning and generalized planning. In the first case, state symmetries can be used to reduce the size of the search; in the second, to reduce the size of the training set. In the case of general planning, however, it is also critical to distinguish non-symmetric states, i.e., states that represent non-isomorphic relational structures. However, while the language of first-order logic distinguishes non-symmetric states, the languages and architectures used to represent and learn general policies do not. In particular, recent approaches for learning general policies use state features derived from description logics or learned via graph neural networks (GNNs) that are known to be limited by the expressive power of C_2, first-order logic with two variables and counting. In this work, we address the problem of detecting symmetries in planning and generalized planning and use the results to assess the expressive requirements for learning general policies over various planning domains. For this, we map planning states to plain graphs, run off-the-shelf algorithms to determine whether two states are isomorphic with respect to the goal, and run coloring algorithms to determine if C_2 features computed logically or via GNNs distinguish non-isomorphic states. Symmetry detection results in more effective learning, while the failure to detect non-symmetries prevents general policies from being learned at all in certain domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2024) in the Reasoning, Learning, and Decision Making track</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Distillation on Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11798v4)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient real-time traffic prediction is crucial for reducing transportation time. To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs. Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data, we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation, incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores, addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of the teacher, even with the retention of only 3% of network parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGI:A GNN Explanation Method using Game Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15698v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention and have been extensively utilized across various domains. However, similar to other deep learning models, GNNs are often viewed as black-box models, making it challenging to interpret their prediction mechanisms. Current graph explanation techniques focus on identifying key nodes or edges, attributing the critical data features that drive model predictions. Nevertheless, these features do not independently influence the model's outcomes; rather, they interact with one another to collectively affect predictions. In this work, we propose a novel explanatory method GraphGI, which identifies the coalition with the highest interaction strength and presents it as an explanatory subgraph. Given a trained model and an input graph, our method explains predictions by gradually incorporating significant edges into the selected subgraph. We utilize game-theoretic interaction values to assess the interaction strength after edge additions, ensuring that the newly added edges confer maximum interaction strength to the explanatory subgraph. To enhance computational efficiency, we adopt effective approximation techniques for calculating Shapley values and game-theoretic interaction values. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior fidelity and sparsity, maintaining the interpretability of the results at a comprehensible level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer for Stock Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15662v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have achieved significant success in various time series forecasting tasks. However, due to the lack of explicit and fixed spatial relationships in stock prediction tasks, many STGNNs fail to perform effectively in this domain. While some STGNNs learn spatial relationships from time series, they often lack comprehensiveness. Research indicates that modeling time series using feature changes as tokens reveals entirely different information compared to using time steps as tokens. To more comprehensively extract dynamic spatial information from stock data, we propose a Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer (DPA-STIFormer). DPA-STIFormer models each node via continuous changes in features as tokens and introduces a Double Direction Self-adaptation Fusion mechanism. This mechanism decomposes node encoding into temporal and feature representations, simultaneously extracting different spatial correlations from a double path approach, and proposes a Double-path gating mechanism to fuse these two types of correlation information. Experiments conducted on four stock market datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, validating the model's superior capability in uncovering latent temporal-correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |

The main research work includes: Firstly, based on the experience of predecessors, we selected 29 enterprise financial data indicators, abstracted each indicator as a vertex, deeply analyzed the relationships between the indicators, constructed a similarity matrix of indicators, and used the maximum spanning tree algorithm to achieve the graph structure mapping of enterprises; secondly, in the representation learning phase of the mapped graph, a graph neural network model was built to obtain its embedded representation. The feature vector of each node was expanded to 32 dimensions, and three GraphSAGE operations were performed on the graph, with the results pooled using the Pool operation, and the final output of three feature vectors was averaged to obtain the graph's embedded representation; finally, a classifier was constructed using a two-layer fully connected network to complete the prediction task. Experimental results on real enterprise data show that the model proposed in this paper can well complete the multi-level credit level estimation of enterprises. Furthermore, the tree-structured graph mapping deeply portrays the intrinsic connections of various indicator data of the company, and according to the ROC and other evaluation criteria, the model's classification effect is significant and has good "robustness".</p></details> |  |

However, explaining their decision-making process is challenging due to the complex transformations GNNs perform by aggregating relational information from graph topology. Existing methods for explaining GNNs face key limitations: (1) lack of flexibility in generating explanations at varying levels, (2) difficulty in identifying unique substructures relevant to class differentiation, and (3) little support to ensure the trustworthiness of explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a visual analytics system designed to generate and evaluate multi-level GNN explanations for graph classification tasks. GNNAnatomy uses graphlets, primitive graph substructures, to identify the most critical substructures in a graph class by analyzing the correlation between GNN predictions and graphlet frequencies. These correlations are presented interactively for user-selected group of graphs through our visual analytics system. To further validate top-ranked graphlets, we measure the change in classification confidence after removing each graphlet from the original graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy through case studies on synthetic and real-world graph datasets from sociology and biology domains. Additionally, we compare GNNAnatomy with state-of-the-art explainable GNN methods to showcase its utility and versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotifDisco: Motif Causal Discovery For Time Series Motifs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15219v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call motifs. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify causal relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (motif disco-very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of Motif Causality (MC), inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We also integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for other downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |  |

Currently, many studies consider SLOs as a system resource to be allocated, ensuring QoS meets the SLOs. Existing microservice auto-scaling frameworks that rely on SLO resources often utilize complex and computationally intensive models, requiring significant time and resources to determine appropriate resource allocation. This paper aims to rapidly allocate SLO resources and minimize resource costs while ensuring application QoS meets the SLO requirements in a dynamically changing microservice environment. We propose MSARS, a framework that leverages meta-learning to quickly derive SLO resource allocation strategies and employs reinforcement learning for adaptive scaling of microservice resources. It features three innovative components: First, MSARS uses graph convolutional networks to predict the most suitable SLO resource allocation scheme for the current environment. Second, MSARS utilizes meta-learning to enable the graph neural network to quickly adapt to environmental changes ensuring adaptability in highly dynamic microservice environments. Third, MSARS generates auto-scaling policies for each microservice based on an improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) model. The adaptive auto-scaling policy integrates the SLO resource allocation strategy into the scheduling algorithm to satisfy SLOs. Finally, we compare MSARS with state-of-the-art resource auto-scaling algorithms that utilize neural networks and reinforcement learning, MSARS takes 40% less time to adapt to new environments, 38% reduction of SLO violations, and 8% less resources cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, IEEE ISPA 2024</p></details> |
| **[FastGL: A GPU-Efficient Framework for Accelerating Sampling-Based GNN Training at Large Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14939v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great superiority on non-Euclidean graph data, achieving ground-breaking performance on various graph-related tasks. As a practical solution to train GNN on large graphs with billions of nodes and edges, the sampling-based training is widely adopted by existing training frameworks. However, through an in-depth analysis, we observe that the efficiency of existing sampling-based training frameworks is still limited due to the key bottlenecks lying in all three phases of sampling-based training, i.e., subgraph sample, memory IO, and computation. To this end, we propose FastGL, a GPU-efficient Framework for accelerating sampling-based training of GNN at Large scale by simultaneously optimizing all above three phases, taking into account both GPU characteristics and graph structure. Specifically, by exploiting the inherent overlap within graph structures, FastGL develops the Match-Reorder strategy to reduce the data traffic, which accelerates the memory IO without incurring any GPU memory overhead. Additionally, FastGL leverages a Memory-Aware computation method, harnessing the GPU memory's hierarchical nature to mitigate irregular data access during computation. FastGL further incorporates the Fused-Map approach aimed at diminishing the synchronization overhead during sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastGL can achieve an average speedup of 11.8x, 2.2x and 1.5x over the state-of-the-art frameworks PyG, DGL, and GNNLab, respectively.Our code is available at https://github.com/a1bc2def6g/fastgl-ae.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASPLOS 2024 fall cycle after major revision</p></details> |

Existing works usually incorporate graph knowledge with conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), resulting in a sequential pipeline that compartmentalizes the encoding processes for textual and graph-based knowledge. This compartmentalization does, however, not fully exploit the contextual interplay between these two types of input knowledge. In this paper, a novel context-aware graph-attention model (Context-aware GAT) is proposed, designed to effectively assimilate global features from relevant knowledge graphs through a context-enhanced knowledge aggregation mechanism. Specifically, the proposed framework employs an innovative approach to representation learning that harmonizes heterogeneous features by amalgamating flattened graph knowledge with text data. The hierarchical application of graph knowledge aggregation within connected subgraphs, complemented by contextual information, to bolster the generation of commonsense-driven dialogues is analyzed. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework outperforms conventional GNN-based language models in terms of performance. Both, automated and human evaluations affirm the significant performance enhancements achieved by our proposed model over the concept flow baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INLG 2024</p></details> |

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted approach, but while advanced techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) have enhanced CF models for better user representations, they often lack the ability to provide explanations for the recommended items. Explainable recommendations aim to address this gap by offering transparency and insights into the recommendation decision-making process, enhancing users' understanding. This work leverages the language capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of explainable recommender systems. We introduce a model-agnostic framework called XRec, which enables LLMs to provide comprehensive explanations for user behaviors in recommender systems. By integrating collaborative signals and designing a lightweight collaborative adaptor, the framework empowers LLMs to understand complex patterns in user-item interactions and gain a deeper understanding of user preferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of XRec, showcasing its ability to generate comprehensive and meaningful explanations that outperform baseline approaches in explainable recommender systems. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/XRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

The high-speed rotating blades provide power by sucking in air and fully combusting, and various defects will inevitably occur, threatening the operation safety of aero-engine. Therefore, regular inspections are essential for such a complex system. However, existing traditional technology which is borescope inspection is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and experience-dependent. To endow this technology with intelligence, a novel superpixel perception graph neural network (SPGNN) is proposed by utilizing a multi-stage graph convolutional network (MSGCN) for feature extraction and superpixel perception region proposal network (SPRPN) for region proposal. First, to capture complex and irregular textures, the images are transformed into a series of patches, to obtain their graph representations. Then, MSGCN composed of several GCN blocks extracts graph structure features and performs graph information processing at graph level. Last but not least, the SPRPN is proposed to generate perceptual bounding boxes by fusing graph representation features and superpixel perception features. Therefore, the proposed SPGNN always implements feature extraction and information transmission at the graph level in the whole SPGNN pipeline, to alleviate the reduction of receptive field and information loss. To verify the effectiveness of SPGNN, we construct a simulated blade dataset with 3000 images. A public aluminum dataset is also used to validate the performances of different methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPGNN has superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a conference paper to International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2024)</p></details> |

While using all the available information can potentially improve on the accuracy of the flow prediction, there has been little attention to the hierarchical relationship between the type of tickets collected from the passengers entering/exiting a station and its resulting passenger flow. To this end, we propose a novel Integrative Prediction Framework with the Hierarchical Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (IPF-HMGNN). The proposed framework consists of three components: initial prediction, task judgment and hierarchical coordination modules. Using the Wuxi, China metro network as an example, we study two prediction approaches (i) traditional prediction approach where the model directly predicts passenger flow at the station, and (ii) hierarchical prediction approach where the prediction of ticket type and station passenger flow are performed simultaneously considering the hierarchical constraints (i.e., the sum of predicted passenger flow per ticket type equals the predicted station aggregated passenger flow). Experimental results indicate that in the traditional prediction approach, our IPF-HMGNN can significantly reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the GNN prediction model by 49.56% and 53.88%, respectively. In the hierarchical prediction approach, IPF-HMGNN can achieve a maximum reduction of 35.32% in MAE and 36.18% in RMSE, while satisfying the hierarchical constraint.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Traffic Flow using Wavelet-based Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04440v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem in the field of machine learning, impacting urban traffic management systems. In general, spatiotemporal forecasting problems involve complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Due to this, traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble method can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make reliable long-term forecasts. In addition to point forecasts, our proposed model can generate interval forecasts that significantly enhance probabilistic forecasting for traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, many of these approaches overlook the crucial role of relation information and inadequately integrate it with entity information, resulting in diminished expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph encoder that incorporates tensor decomposition within the aggregation function of Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN). Our model enhances the representation of neighboring entities by employing projection matrices of a low-rank tensor defined by relation types. This approach facilitates multi-task learning, thereby generating relation-aware representations. Furthermore, we introduce a low-rank estimation technique for the core tensor through CP decomposition, which effectively compresses and regularizes our model. We adopt a training strategy inspired by contrastive learning, which relieves the training limitation of the 1-N method inherent in handling vast graphs. We outperformed all our competitors on two common benchmark datasets, FB15k-237 and WN18RR, while using low-dimensional embeddings for entities and relations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 Tables, 2 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Boolean Product Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14001v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently achieved significant success, with a key operation involving the aggregation of information from neighboring nodes. Substantial researchers have focused on defining neighbors for aggregation, predominantly based on observed adjacency matrices. However, in many scenarios, the explicitly given graphs contain noise, which can be amplified during the messages-passing process. Therefore, many researchers have turned their attention to latent graph inference, specifically learning a parametric graph. To mitigate fluctuations in latent graph structure learning, this paper proposes a novel Boolean product-based graph residual connection in GNNs to link the latent graph and the original graph. It computes the Boolean product between the latent graph and the original graph at each layer to correct the learning process. The Boolean product between two adjacency matrices is equivalent to triangle detection. Accordingly, the proposed Boolean product graph neural networks can be interpreted as discovering triangular cliques from the original and the latent graph. We validate the proposed method in benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to enhance the performance and robustness of GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.10688</p></details> |

The proposed system converts syntactic structures into a matrix format, leveraging convolutions and attention mechanisms within a graph to distill salient characteristics. Incorporating the positional relevance of descriptors relative to lexical items enhances the sequential integrity of the input.

| **[One Model, Any Conjunctive Query: Graph Neural Networks for Answering Complex Queries over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13959v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional query answering over knowledge graphs -- or broadly over relational data -- is one of the most fundamental problems in data management. Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this work, we propose AnyCQ, a graph neural network model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph, following training. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network model trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Our approach and problem setup differ from existing query answering studies in multiple dimensions. First, we focus on the problem of query answer classification: given a query and a set of possible answers, classify these proposals as true or false relative to the complete knowledge graph. Second, we study the problem of query answer retrieval: given a query, retrieve an answer to the query relative to the complete knowledge graph or decide that no correct solutions exist. Trained on simple, small instances, AnyCQ can generalize to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to samples where existing approaches fail, which is empirically validated on new and challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our AnyCQ models effectively transfer to out-of-distribution knowledge graphs, when equipped with a relevant link predictor, highlighting their potential to serve as a general engine for query answering.</p></details> |  |

Particle-resolved models are the only models able to capture this diversity in particle physiochemical properties, and these models are computationally expensive. As a strategy for accelerating particle-resolved microphysics models, we introduce Graph-based Learning of Aerosol Dynamics (GLAD) and use this model to train a surrogate of the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. GLAD implements a Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS), a machine learning framework that has been used to simulate particle-based fluid dynamics models. In GLAD, each particle is represented as a node in a graph, and the evolution of the particle population over time is simulated through learned message passing. We demonstrate our GNS approach on a simple aerosol system that includes condensation of sulfuric acid onto particles composed of sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon, and water. A graph with particles as nodes is constructed, and a graph neural network (GNN) is then trained using the model output from PartMC-MOSAIC. The trained GNN can then be used for simulating and predicting aerosol dynamics over time. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately learn chemical dynamics and generalize across different scenarios, achieving efficient training and prediction times. We evaluate the performance across three scenarios, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability in modeling aerosol microphysics and chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Ordering in Crystalline Materials with Symmetry-Aware Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13851v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning workhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields such as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures. Multicomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can exhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a variety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to fully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability, strength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on orderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure GCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the ordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we benchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the ordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made dataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional symmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference between the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same material, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently preserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various orderings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generative Framework for Predictive Modeling of Multiple Chronic Conditions Using Graph Variational Autoencoder and Bandit-Optimized Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13671v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the emergence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is crucial for early intervention and personalized healthcare, as MCC significantly impacts patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective methods for modeling complex graph data, such as those found in MCC. However, a significant challenge with GNNs is their reliance on an existing graph structure, which is not readily available for MCC. To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative framework for GNNs that constructs a representative underlying graph structure by utilizing the distribution of the data to enhance predictive analytics for MCC. Our framework employs a graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) to capture the complex relationships in patient data. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of individual health trajectories and facilitates the creation of diverse patient stochastic similarity graphs while preserving the original feature set. These variations of patient stochastic similarity graphs, generated from the GVAE decoder, are then processed by a GNN using a novel Laplacian regularization technique to refine the graph structure over time and improves the prediction accuracy of MCC. A contextual Bandit is designed to evaluate the stochastically generated graphs and identify the best-performing graph for the GNN model iteratively until model convergence. We validate the performance of the proposed contextual Bandit algorithm against $\varepsilon$-Greedy and multi-armed Bandit algorithms on a large cohort (n = 1,592) of patients with MCC. These advancements highlight the potential of the proposed approach to transform predictive healthcare analytics, enabling a more personalized and proactive approach to MCC management.</p></details> |  |

Traditional computational methods often struggle with the dynamic nature of these networks. This study explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a powerful approach for modeling graph-structured data like GRNs. Utilizing a Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2), our study presents a novel approach to the construction and interrogation of GRNs, informed by gene expression data and Boolean models derived from literature. The model's adeptness in accurately predicting regulatory interactions and pinpointing key regulators is attributed to advanced attention mechanisms, a hallmark of the GNN framework. These insights suggest that GNNs are primed to revolutionize GRN analysis, addressing traditional limitations and offering richer biological insights. The success of GNNs, as highlighted by our model's reliance on high-quality data, calls for enhanced data collection methods to sustain progress. The integration of GNNs in GRN research is set to pioneer developments in personalized medicine, drug discovery, and our grasp of biological systems, bolstered by the structural analysis of networks for improved node and edge prediction.</p></details> | 24 Pages, 6 Figures |

Despite these successes, their performance, confidence, and trustworthiness are often limited by the inherent randomness of data in nature and the challenges of accurately capturing and modeling real-world complexities. This has increased interest in developing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques tailored to graphical models. In this survey, we comprehensively examine these existing works on UQ in graphical models, focusing on key aspects such as foundational knowledge, sources, representation, handling, and measurement of uncertainty. This survey distinguishes itself from most existing UQ surveys by specifically concentrating on UQ in graphical models, particularly probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). We elaborately categorize recent work into two primary areas: uncertainty representation and uncertainty handling. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, including both established methodologies and emerging trends, we aim to bridge gaps in understanding and highlight key challenges and opportunities in the field. Through in-depth discussion of existing works and promising directions for future research, we believe this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, inspiring them to cope with uncertainty issues in both academic research and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the softmax function lacks spatial information of the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a graph similarity regularized softmax for GNNs in semi-supervised node classification. By incorporating non-local total variation (TV) regularization into the softmax activation function, we can more effectively capture the spatial information inherent in graphs. The weights in the non-local gradient and divergence operators are determined based on the graph's adjacency matrix. We apply the proposed method into the architecture of GCN and GraphSAGE, testing them on citation and webpage linking datasets, respectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate its good performance in node classification and generalization capabilities. These results indicate that the graph similarity regularized softmax is effective on both assortative and disassortative graphs.</p></details> |  |

As post-translational modifications, they modulate protein structure, function, and interactions. Due to their diversity and complexity, predictive models of glycan properties and functions are still insufficient. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed to process and analyze graph-structured data. These architectures leverage the connectivity and relational information in graphs to learn effective representations of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. Iteratively aggregating information from neighboring nodes, GNNs capture complex patterns within graph data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as link prediction or graph classification across domains. This work presents a new model architecture based on combinatorial complexes and higher-order message passing to extract features from glycan structures into a latent space representation. The architecture is evaluated on an improved GlycanML benchmark suite, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.

These tokens are meant to improve the global awareness of link predictions models which, based on graph neural networks, can struggle to capture graph-level features. This lack of ability to feature high level representations is particularly limiting when predicting multiple or entire sets of links. We implement CAM tokens in a simple attention-based link prediction model and in a graph transformer, which we also use in a denoising diffusion framework. A brief introduction to our toy datasets will then be followed by benchmarks which prove that CAM token improve the performance of the model they supplement and outperform a baseline with diverse statistical graph attributes.</p></details> |  |

Although sequence-based transformer models have shown promising results by leveraging the vast amount of protein sequence data in a self-supervised way, there is still a gap in exploiting the available 3D protein structures. In this work, we propose a pre-training scheme going beyond trivial masking methods leveraging 3D and hierarchical structures of proteins. We propose a novel self-supervised method to pretrain 3D graph neural networks on 3D protein structures, by predicting the distances between local geometric centroids of protein subgraphs and the global geometric centroid of the protein. By considering subgraphs and their relationships to the global protein structure, our model can better learn the geometric properties of the protein structure. We experimentally show that our proposed pertaining strategy leads to significant improvements up to 6\%, in the performance of 3D GNNs in various protein classification tasks. Our work opens new possibilities in unsupervised learning for protein graph models while eliminating the need for multiple views, augmentations, or masking strategies which are currently used so far.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Spatial Temporal Prediction Under Data Drift with Informative Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13253v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive spatial temporal prediction can generalize historical data to predict unseen data, crucial for highly dynamic scenarios (e.g., traffic systems, stock markets). However, external events (e.g., urban structural growth, market crash) and emerging new entities (e.g., locations, stocks) can undermine prediction accuracy by inducing data drift over time. Most existing studies extract invariant patterns to counter data drift but ignore pattern diversity, exhibiting poor generalization to unseen entities. To address this issue, we design an Informative Graph Neural Network (INF-GNN) to distill diversified invariant patterns and improve prediction accuracy under data drift. Firstly, we build an informative subgraph with a uniquely designed metric, Relation Importance (RI), that can effectively select stable entities and distinct spatial relationships. This subgraph further generalizes new entities' data via neighbors merging. Secondly, we propose an informative temporal memory buffer to help the model emphasize valuable timestamps extracted using influence functions within time intervals. This memory buffer allows INF-GNN to discern influential temporal patterns. Finally, RI loss optimization is designed for pattern consolidation. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset under substantial data drift demonstrate that INF-GNN significantly outperforms existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRAGA: Prototype-aware Graph Adaptive Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12728v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Compare Hardware Designs for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13138v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) is an automated design process that transforms high-level code into hardware designs, enabling the rapid development of hardware accelerators. HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways. To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MLCAD 2024</p></details> |
| **[Improved Image Classification with Manifold Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13063v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in various learning tasks, with successful applications in fields like molecular biology, transportation systems, and electrical grids. These fields naturally use graph data, benefiting from GNNs' message-passing framework. However, the potential of GNNs in more general data representations, especially in the image domain, remains underexplored. Leveraging the manifold hypothesis, which posits that high-dimensional data lies in a low-dimensional manifold, we explore GNNs' potential in this context. We construct an image manifold using variational autoencoders, then sample the manifold to generate graphs where each node is an image. This approach reduces data dimensionality while preserving geometric information. We then train a GNN to predict node labels corresponding to the image labels in the classification task, and leverage convergence of GNNs to manifold neural networks to analyze GNN generalization. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that GNNs generalize effectively to unseen graphs, achieving competitive accuracy in classification tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Gait-based Age Group Classification with Adaptive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00294v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning techniques have recently been utilized for model-free age-associated gait feature extraction. However, acquiring model-free gait demands accurate pre-processing such as background subtraction, which is non-trivial in unconstrained environments. On the other hand, model-based gait can be obtained without background subtraction and is less affected by covariates. For model-based gait-based age group classification problems, present works rely solely on handcrafted features, where feature extraction is tedious and requires domain expertise. This paper proposes a deep learning approach to extract age-associated features from model-based gait for age group classification. Specifically, we first develop an unconstrained gait dataset called Multimedia University Gait Age and Gender dataset (MMU GAG). Next, the body joint coordinates are determined via pose estimation algorithms and represented as compact gait graphs via a novel part aggregation scheme. Then, a Part-AdaptIve Residual Graph Convolutional Neural Network (PairGCN) is designed for age-associated feature learning. Experiments suggest that PairGCN features are far more informative than handcrafted features, yielding up to 99% accuracy for classifying subjects as a child, adult, or senior in the MMU GAG dataset. These results suggest the feasibility of deploying Artificial Intelligence-enabled solutions for access control, surveillance, and law enforcement in unconstrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cloudy with a Chance of Anomalies: Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Early Detection of Cloud Services' User Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12726v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the security of cloud environments is imperative for sustaining organizational growth and operational efficiency. As the ubiquity of cloud services continues to rise, the inevitability of cyber threats underscores the importance of preemptive detection. This paper introduces a pioneering time-based embedding approach for Cloud Services Graph-based Anomaly Detection (CS-GAD), utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to discern anomalous user behavior during interactions with cloud services. Our method employs a dynamic tripartite graph representation to encapsulate the evolving interactions among cloud services, users, and their activities over time. Leveraging GNN models in each time frame, our approach generates a graph embedding wherein each user is assigned a score based on their historical activity, facilitating the identification of unusual behavior. Results demonstrate a notable reduction in false positive rates (2-9%) compared to prevailing methods, coupled with a commendable true positive rate (100%). The contributions of this work encompass early detection capabilities, a low false positive rate, an innovative tripartite graph representation incorporating action types, the introduction of a new cloud services dataset featuring various user attacks, and an open-source implementation for community collaboration in advancing cloud service security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Explainable Reasoning in 6G: A Proof of Concept Study on Radio Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10186v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The move toward artificial intelligence (AI)-native sixth-generation (6G) networks has put more emphasis on the importance of explainability and trustworthiness in network management operations, especially for mission-critical use-cases. Such desired trust transcends traditional post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods to using contextual explanations for guiding the learning process in an in-hoc way. This paper proposes a novel graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework named TANGO which relies on a symbolic subsystem. It consists of a Bayesian-graph neural network (GNN) Explainer, whose outputs, in terms of edge/node importance and uncertainty, are periodically translated to a logical GRL reward function. This adjustment is accomplished through defined symbolic reasoning rules within a Reasoner. Considering a real-world testbed proof-of-concept (PoC), a gNodeB (gNB) radio resource allocation problem is formulated, which aims to minimize under- and over-provisioning of physical resource blocks (PRBs) while penalizing decisions emanating from the uncertain and less important edge-nodes relations. Our findings reveal that the proposed in-hoc explainability solution significantly expedites convergence compared to standard GRL baseline and other benchmarks in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) domain. The experiment evaluates performance in AI, complexity, energy consumption, robustness, network, scalability, and explainability metrics. Specifically, the results show that TANGO achieves a noteworthy accuracy of 96.39% in terms of optimal PRB allocation in inference phase, outperforming the baseline by 1.22x.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[PromSec: Prompt Optimization for Secure Generation of Functional Source Code with Large Language Models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12699v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capability of generating high-quality source code using large language models (LLMs) reduces software development time and costs. However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Centrality-Based Node Feature Augmentation for Robust Network Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12751v5)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables; its conference version was presented at the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2022)</p></details> |
| **[CF-GO-Net: A Universal Distribution Learner via Characteristic Function Networks with Graph Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12610v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models aim to learn the distribution of datasets, such as images, so as to be able to generate samples that statistically resemble real data. However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12519v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most studies focused on information retrieval-based techniques for fault localization, which built representations for bug reports and source code files and matched their semantic vectors through similarity measurement. However, such approaches often ignore some useful information that might help improve localization performance, such as 1) the interaction relationship between bug reports and source code files; 2) the similarity relationship between bug reports; and 3) the co-citation relationship between source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Fault Localization (MACL-IRFL) to learn the above-mentioned relationships for software fault localization. Specifically, we first generate data augmentations from report-code interaction view, report-report similarity view and code-code co-citation view separately, and adopt graph neural network to aggregate the information of bug reports or source code files from the three views in the embedding process. Moreover, we perform contrastive learning across these views. Our design of contrastive learning task will force the bug report representations to encode information shared by report-report and report-code views,and the source code file representations shared by code-code and report-code views, thereby alleviating the noise from auxiliary information. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five open-source Java projects. The results show that our model can improve over the best baseline up to 28.93%, 25.57% and 20.35% on Accuracy@1, MAP and MRR, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention Dual Embedding for Graphs with Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18385v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been highly successful for the node classification task. GNNs typically assume graphs are homophilic, i.e. neighboring nodes are likely to belong to the same class. However, a number of real-world graphs are heterophilic, and this leads to much lower classification accuracy using standard GNNs. In this work, we design a novel GNN which is effective for both heterophilic and homophilic graphs. Our work is based on three main observations. First, we show that node features and graph topology provide different amounts of informativeness in different graphs, and therefore they should be encoded independently and prioritized in an adaptive manner. Second, we show that allowing negative attention weights when propagating graph topology information improves accuracy. Finally, we show that asymmetric attention weights between nodes are helpful. We design a GNN which makes use of these observations through a novel self-attention mechanism. We evaluate our algorithm on real-world graphs containing thousands to millions of nodes and show that we achieve state-of-the-art results compared to existing GNNs. We also analyze the effectiveness of the main components of our design on different graphs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

However, the complexity of traffic networks has rendered traditional machine learning and statistical methods less effective. With the advent of artificial intelligence, deep learning frameworks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields and are now considered highly effective in many areas. Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising deep learning approach within the ITS domain, owing to their robust ability to model graph-structured data and address complex problems. Consequently, there has been increasing scholarly attention to the applications of GNNs in transportation, which have demonstrated excellent performance. Nevertheless, current research predominantly focuses on traffic forecasting, with other ITS domains, such as autonomous vehicles and demand prediction, receiving less attention. This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs across six representative and emerging ITS research areas: traffic forecasting, vehicle control system, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and parking management. We have examined a wide range of graph-related studies from 2018 to 2023, summarizing their methodologies, features, and contributions in detailed tables and lists. Additionally, we identify the challenges of applying GNNs in ITS and propose potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Customizing Graph Neural Networks using Path Reweighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10866v4)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been extensively used for mining graph-structured data with impressive performance. However, because these traditional GNNs do not distinguish among various downstream tasks, embeddings embedded by them are not always effective. Intuitively, paths in a graph imply different semantics for different downstream tasks. Inspired by this, we design a novel GNN solution, namely Customized Graph Neural Network with Path Reweighting (CustomGNN for short). Specifically, the proposed CustomGNN can automatically learn the high-level semantics for specific downstream tasks to highlight semantically relevant paths as well to filter out task-irrelevant noises in a graph. Furthermore, we empirically analyze the semantics learned by CustomGNN and demonstrate its ability to avoid the three inherent problems in traditional GNNs, i.e., over-smoothing, poor robustness, and overfitting. In experiments with the node classification task, CustomGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on three standard graph datasets and four large graph datasets. The source code of the proposed CustomGNN is available at \url{https://github.com/cjpcool/CustomGNN}.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</p></details> |  |
