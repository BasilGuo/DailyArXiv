| **[Strategies and Challenges of Efficient White-Box Training for Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08507v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition using time-series data from wearable sensors poses unique challenges due to complex temporal dependencies, sensor noise, placement variability, and diverse human behaviors. These factors, combined with the nontransparent nature of black-box Machine Learning models impede interpretability and hinder human comprehension of model behavior. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring strategies to enhance interpretability through white-box approaches, which provide actionable insights into latent space dynamics and model behavior during training. By leveraging human intuition and expertise, the proposed framework improves explainability, fosters trust, and promotes transparent Human Activity Recognition systems. A key contribution is the proposal of a Human-in-the-Loop framework that enables dynamic user interaction with models, facilitating iterative refinements to enhance performance and efficiency. Additionally, we investigate the usefulness of Large Language Model as an assistance to provide users with guidance for interpreting visualizations, diagnosing issues, and optimizing workflows. Together, these contributions present a scalable and efficient framework for developing interpretable and accessible Human Activity Recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoPlant: Spatial Plant Species Prediction Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13928v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multimodal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10--50m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time series of climatic variables, and satellite time series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first operates by estimating the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models. The empirical study demonstrates that our proposed \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025.

| **[Task-specific Self-body Controller Acquisition by Musculoskeletal Humanoids: Application to Pedal Control in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08270v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The musculoskeletal humanoid has many benefits that human beings have, but the modeling of its complex flexible body is difficult. Although we have developed an online acquisition method of the nonlinear relationship between joints and muscles, we could not completely match the actual robot and its self-body image. When realizing a certain task, the direct relationship between the control input and task state needs to be learned. So, we construct a neural network representing the time-series relationship between the control input and task state, and realize the intended task state by applying the network to a real-time control. In this research, we conduct accelerator pedal control experiments as one application, and verify the effectiveness of this study.</p></details> | Accepted at IROS2019 |
| **[Fast pick-freeze estimation of Sobol' sensitivity maps using basis expansions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08224v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) aims at quantifying the contribution of input variables over the variability of model outputs. In the frame of functional outputs, a common goal is to compute sensitivity maps (SM), i.e sensitivity indices at each output dimension (e.g. time step for time series, or pixels for spatial outputs). In specific settings, some works have shown that the computation of Sobol' SM can be speeded up by using basis expansions employed for dimension reduction. However, how to efficiently compute such SM in a general setting has not received too much attention in the GSA literature.In this work, we propose fast computations of Sobol' SM using a general basis expansion, with a focus on statistical estimation. First, we write a closed-form expression of SM in function of the matrix-valued Sobol' index of the vector of basis coefficients. Secondly, we consider pick-freeze (PF) estimators, which have nice statistical properties (in terms of asymptotical efficiency) for Sobol' indices of any order. We provide similar basis-derived formulas for the PF estimator of Sobol' SM in function of the matrix-valued PF estimator of the vector of basis coefficients. We give the computational cost, and show that, compared to a dimension-wise approach, the computational gain is substantial and allows to calculate both SM and their associated bootstrap confidence bounds in a reasonable time. Finally, we illustrate the whole methodology on an analytical test case and on an application in non-Newtonian hydraulics, modelling an idealized dam-break flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-optimal persistent homology representatives for univariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08209v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main methods used in Topological Data Analysis. An active area of research in the field is the study of appropriate notions of PH representatives, which allow to interpret the meaning of the information provided by PH, making it an important problem in the application of PH, and in the study of its interpretability. Computing optimal PH representatives is a problem that is known to be NP-hard, and one is therefore interested in developing context-specific optimality notions that are computable in practice. Here we introduce time-optimal PH representatives for time-varying data, allowing one to extract representatives that are close in time in an appropriate sense. We illustrate our methods on quasi-periodic synthetic time series, as well as time series arising from climate models, and we show that our methods provide optimal PH representatives that are better suited for these types of problems than existing optimality notions, such as length-optimal PH representatives.</p></details> | 30 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Mixture of Online and Offline Experts for Non-stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05996v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a general and realistic scenario involving non-stationary time series, consisting of several offline intervals with different distributions within a fixed offline time horizon, and an online interval that continuously receives new samples. For non-stationary time series, the data distribution in the current online interval may have appeared in previous offline intervals. We theoretically explore the feasibility of applying knowledge from offline intervals to the current online interval. To this end, we propose the Mixture of Online and Offline Experts (MOOE). MOOE learns static offline experts from offline intervals and maintains a dynamic online expert for the current online interval. It then adaptively combines the offline and online experts using a meta expert to make predictions for the samples received in the online interval. Specifically, we focus on theoretical analysis, deriving parameter convergence, regret bounds, and generalization error bounds to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tube Loss: A Novel Approach for Prediction Interval Estimation and probabilistic forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06853v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks. The codes of the experiments are available at https://github.com/ltpritamanand/Tube_loss</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | accepted at AAAI'25 |
| **[Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Driving Patterns Using High Resolution Telematics Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08106v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle telematics provides granular data for dynamic driving risk assessment, but current methods often rely on aggregated metrics (e.g., harsh braking counts) and do not fully exploit the rich time-series structure of telematics data. In this paper, we introduce a flexible framework using continuous-time hidden Markov model (CTHMM) to model and analyze trip-level telematics data. Unlike existing methods, the CTHMM models raw time-series data without predefined thresholds on harsh driving events or assumptions about accident probabilities. Moreover, our analysis is based solely on telematics data, requiring no traditional covariates such as driver or vehicle characteristics. Through unsupervised anomaly detection based on pseudo-residuals, we identify deviations from normal driving patterns -- defined as the prevalent behaviour observed in a driver's history or across the population -- which are linked to accident risk. Validated on both controlled and real-world datasets, the CTHMM effectively detects abnormal driving behaviour and trips with increased accident likelihood. In real-data analysis, higher anomaly levels in longitudinal and lateral accelerations consistently correlate with greater accident risk, with classification models using this information achieving ROC-AUC values as high as 0.86 for trip-level analysis and 0.78 for distinguishing drivers with claims. Furthermore, the methodology reveals significant behavioural differences between drivers with and without claims, offering valuable insights for insurance applications, accident analysis, and prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08099v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Accurate Prediction of Temperature Indicators in Eastern China Using a Multi-Scale CNN-LSTM-Attention model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07997v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the importance of accurate weather forecasting has become increasingly prominent due to the impacts of global climate change and the rapid development of data science. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to handle the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in climate data. To address these challenges, we propose a weather prediction model based on a multi-scale convolutional CNN-LSTM-Attention architecture, specifically designed for time series forecasting of temperature data in China. The model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms to leverage the strengths of spatial feature extraction, temporal sequence modeling, and the ability to focus on important features. The development process of the model includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building. Experimental results show that the model performs excellently in predicting temperature trends with high accuracy. The final computed results indicate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 1.978295 and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is 0.8106562. This work marks a significant advancement in applying deep learning techniques to meteorological data, offering a valuable tool for improving weather forecasting accuracy and providing essential support for decision-making in areas such as urban planning, agriculture, and energy management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning of Multivariate Time Series using Attention and Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01987v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical factor in trustworthy machine learning is to develop robust representations of the training data. Only under this guarantee methods are legitimate to artificially generate data, for example, to counteract imbalanced datasets or provide counterfactual explanations for blackbox decision-making systems. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown considerable results in forming stable representations and generating realistic data. While many applications focus on generating image data, less effort has been made in generating time series data, especially multivariate signals. In this work, a Transformer-based autoencoder is proposed that is regularized using an adversarial training scheme to generate artificial multivariate time series signals. The representation is evaluated using t-SNE visualizations, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Entropy scores. Our results indicate that the generated signals exhibit higher similarity to an exemplary dataset than using a convolutional network approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Chaotic Systems with Quantum Echo-state Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07910v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in artificial neural networks have enabled impressive tasks on classical computers, but they demand significant computational resources. While quantum computing offers potential beyond classical systems, the advantages of quantum neural networks (QNNs) remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present and examine a quantum circuit (QC) that implements and aims to improve upon the classical echo-state network (ESN), a type of reservoir-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs), using quantum computers. Typically, ESNs consist of an extremely large reservoir that learns high-dimensional embeddings, enabling prediction of complex system trajectories. Quantum echo-state networks (QESNs) aim to reduce this need for prohibitively large reservoirs by leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum computers, potentially allowing for more efficient and higher performing time-series prediction algorithms. The proposed QESN can be implemented on any digital quantum computer implementing a universal gate set, and does not require any sort of stopping or re-initialization of the circuit, allowing continuous evolution of the quantum state over long time horizons. We conducted simulated QC experiments on the chaotic Lorenz system, both with noisy and noiseless models, to demonstrate the circuit's performance and its potential for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 figures, submitted to AAAI QC+AI workshop</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Differential Network Analysis for High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07905v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral networks derived from multivariate time series data arise in many domains, from brain science to Earth science. Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments, on experiments with electroencephalography data, and on experiments with optogentic stimulation and micro-electrocorticography data.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |
| **[FlashRNN: Optimizing Traditional RNNs on Modern Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07752v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p></details> |  |
| **[Right on Time: Revising Time Series Models by Constraining their Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12921v4)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of deep time series models is often compromised by their tendency to rely on confounding factors, which may lead to incorrect outputs. Our newly recorded, naturally confounded dataset named P2S from a real mechanical production line emphasizes this. To avoid "Clever-Hans" moments in time series, i.e., to mitigate confounders, we introduce the method Right on Time (RioT). RioT enables, for the first time, interactions with model explanations across both the time and frequency domain. Feedback on explanations in both domains is then used to constrain the model, steering it away from the annotated confounding factors. The dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing confounders in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate that RioT can effectively guide models away from the wrong reasons in P2S as well as popular time series classification and forecasting datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqRISE: Explaining time series using frequency masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13584v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data are fundamentally important for many critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and climate, where explainable models are necessary for safe automated decision making. To develop explainable artificial intelligence in these domains therefore implies explaining salient information in the time series. Current methods for obtaining saliency maps assume localized information in the raw input space. In this paper, we argue that the salient information of a number of time series is more likely to be localized in the frequency domain. We propose FreqRISE, which uses masking-based methods to produce explanations in the frequency and time-frequency domain, and outperforms strong baselines across a number of tasks. The source code is available here: \url{https://github.com/theabrusch/FreqRISE}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-based model validation using a custom metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07521v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle models have a long history of research and as of today are able to model the involved physics in a reasonable manner. However, each new vehicle has its new characteristics or parameters. The identification of these is the main task of an engineer. To validate whether the correct parameter set has been chosen is a tedious task and often can only be performed by experts. Metrics known commonly used in literature are able to compare different results under certain aspects. However, they fail to answer the question: Are the models accurate enough? In this article, we propose the usage of a custom metric trained on the knowledge of experts to tackle this problem. Our approach involves three main steps: first, the formalized collection of subject matter experts' opinion on the question: Having seen the measurement and simulation time series in comparison, is the model quality sufficient? From this step, we obtain a data set that is able to quantify the sufficiency of a simulation result based on a comparison to corresponding experimental data. In a second step, we compute common model metrics on the measurement and simulation time series and use these model metrics as features to a regression model. Third, we fit a regression model to the experts' opinions. This regression model, i.e., our custom metric, can than predict the sufficiency of a new simulation result and gives a confidence on this prediction.</p></details> | 11 pages |

| **[Advancing clinical trial outcomes using deep learning and predictive modelling: bridging precision medicine and patient-centered care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07050v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of artificial intelligence [AI] into clinical trials has revolutionized the process of drug development and personalized medicine. Among these advancements, deep learning and predictive modelling have emerged as transformative tools for optimizing clinical trial design, patient recruitment, and real-time monitoring. This study explores the application of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks [CNNs] and transformerbased models, to stratify patients, forecast adverse events, and personalize treatment plans. Furthermore, predictive modelling approaches, including survival analysis and time-series forecasting, are employed to predict trial outcomes, enhancing efficiency and reducing trial failure rates. To address challenges in analysing unstructured clinical data, such as patient notes and trial protocols, natural language processing [NLP] techniques are utilized for extracting actionable insights. A custom dataset comprising structured patient demographics, genomic data, and unstructured text is curated for training and validating these models. Key metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 scores, are used to evaluate model performance, while trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency are examined to identify the optimal model for clinical deployment. This research underscores the potential of AI-driven methods to streamline clinical trial workflows, improve patient-centric outcomes, and reduce costs associated with trial inefficiencies. The findings provide a robust framework for integrating predictive analytics into precision medicine, paving the way for more adaptive and efficient clinical trials. By bridging the gap between technological innovation and real-world applications, this study contributes to advancing the role of AI in healthcare, particularly in fostering personalized care and improving overall trial success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages excluding references, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[The broader spectrum of in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03782v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit $\unicode{x2014}$ such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</p></details> |  |

We enhance the learning capabilities of these networks by weighting the values obtained by KANs using learnable path signatures, which capture important geometric features of paths. This combination allows for a more comprehensive and flexible representation of sequential and temporal data. We demonstrate through studies that our SigKANs with learnable path signatures perform better than conventional methods across a range of function approximation challenges.

| **[Deep learning for predicting the occurrence of tipping points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18693v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tipping points occur in many real-world systems, at which the system shifts suddenly from one state to another. The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF) for Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14599v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) models can generate high-quality samples from a non-informative prior, but they can be slow, often needing hundreds of network evaluations (NFE). To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation, where we achieve likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.\href{https://github.com/MrRezaeiUofT/IDFF}{Github Repository}</p></details> |  |
| **[Food for thought: How can machine learning help better predict and understand changes in food prices?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06472v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address a lack of systematic understanding of fluctuations in food affordability in Canada. Canada's Food Price Report (CPFR) is an annual publication that predicts food inflation over the next calendar year. The published predictions are a collaborative effort between forecasting teams that each employ their own approach at Canadian Universities: Dalhousie University, the University of British Columbia, the University of Saskatchewan, and the University of Guelph/Vector Institute. While the University of Guelph/Vector Institute forecasting team has leveraged machine learning (ML) in previous reports, the most recent editions (2024--2025) have also included a human-in-the-loop approach. For the 2025 report, this focus was expanded to evaluate several different data-centric approaches to improve forecast accuracy. In this study, we evaluate how different types of forecasting models perform when estimating food price fluctuations. We also examine the sensitivity of models that curate time series data representing key factors in food pricing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Selection for Comparing High-dimensional Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06870v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a pair of multivariate time-series data of the same length and dimensions, an approach is proposed to select variables and time intervals where the two series are significantly different. In applications where one time series is an output from a computationally expensive simulator, the approach may be used for validating the simulator against real data, for comparing the outputs of two simulators, and for validating a machine learning-based emulator against the simulator. With the proposed approach, the entire time interval is split into multiple subintervals, and on each subinterval, the two sample sets are compared to select variables that distinguish their distributions and a two-sample test is performed. The validity and limitations of the proposed approach are investigated in synthetic data experiments. Its usefulness is demonstrated in an application with a particle-based fluid simulator, where a deep neural network model is compared against the simulator, and in an application with a microscopic traffic simulator, where the effects of changing the simulator's parameters on traffic flows are analysed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data on Human Gesture Recognition Tasks Using GANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06389v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is an emerging interest in employing Deep Generative Models (DGMs) to address data scarcity, enhance data quality, and improve classification metrics scores. Among these types of models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have arisen as a powerful tool for generating synthetic data that mimic real-world scenarios with high fidelity. However, Human Gesture Recognition (HGR), a subset of HAR, particularly in healthcare applications, using time series data such as allergic gestures, remains highly unexplored. In this paper, we examine and evaluate the performance of two GANs in the generation of synthetic gesture motion data that compose a part of an open-source benchmark dataset. The data is related to the disease identification domain and healthcare, specifically to allergic rhinitis. We also focus on these AI models' performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, and privacy. Furthermore, we examine the scenario if the synthetic data can substitute real data, in training scenarios and how well models trained on synthetic data can be generalized for the allergic rhinitis gestures. In our work, these gestures are related to 6-axes accelerometer and gyroscope data, serving as multi-variate time series instances, and retrieved from smart wearable devices. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the feasibility of synthesizing motion gestures for allergic rhinitis from wearable IoT device data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and testing their impact on the generalization of gesture recognition systems. It is worth noting that, even if our method has been applied to a specific category of gestures, it is designed to be generalized and can be deployed also to other motion data in the HGR domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Pre-training Data Quality without Labels for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06368v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models that generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation models is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to collect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the performance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of the data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new measure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the foundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the proposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream tasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to search for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve thereby the foundation model's generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMS-AutoTSF: Learnable Multi-Scale Decomposition and Integrated Autocorrelation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06866v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, scientific simulations and industrial process analysis. In this work, we introduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that incorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at multiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing the model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components directly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers to handle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domain filtering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wise transformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-term dependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficiently compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensures faster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting across diverse time horizons.

| **[Mining Limited Data Sufficiently: A BERT-inspired Approach for CSI Time Series Application in Wireless Communication and Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06861v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel State Information (CSI) is the cornerstone in both wireless communication and sensing systems. In wireless communication systems, CSI provides essential insights into channel conditions, enabling system optimizations like channel compensation and dynamic resource allocation. However, the high computational complexity of CSI estimation algorithms necessitates the development of fast deep learning methods for CSI prediction. In wireless sensing systems, CSI can be leveraged to infer environmental changes, facilitating various functions, including gesture recognition and people identification. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant advantages over model-based approaches in these fine-grained CSI classification tasks, particularly when classes vary across different scenarios. However, a major challenge in training deep learning networks for wireless systems is the limited availability of data, further complicated by the diverse formats of many public datasets, which hinder integration. Additionally, collecting CSI data can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable time and manpower. To address these challenges, we propose CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, effectively utilizing limited data through a pre-training and fine-tuning approach. Building on CSI-BERT1, we enhance the model architecture by introducing an Adaptive Re-Weighting Layer (ARL) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to better capture sub-carrier and timestamp information, effectively addressing the permutation-invariance problem. Furthermore, we propose a Mask Prediction Model (MPM) fine-tuning method to improve the model's adaptability for CSI prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by reformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN execution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and network parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background information, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) instrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real radio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of SNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the Journal of IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</p></details> |
| **[Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Zero-Shot Table Understanding via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737v2)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transportation Marketplace Rate Forecast Using Signature Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04857v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight transportation marketplace rates are typically challenging to forecast accurately. In this work, we have developed a novel statistical technique based on signature transforms and have built a predictive and adaptive model to forecast these marketplace rates. Our technique is based on two key elements of the signature transform: one being its universal nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and hence translates the forecasting problem into linear regression, and the other being the signature kernel, which allows for comparing computationally efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon trucking operations, with far superior forecast accuracy and better interpretability versus commercially available industry models, even during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, our technique is able to capture the influence of business cycles and the heterogeneity of the marketplace, improving prediction accuracy by more than fivefold, with an estimated annualized saving of \$50MM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Functional Graphical Models with Change-Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03041v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional data analysis, which models data as realizations of random functions over a continuum, has emerged as a useful tool for time series data. Often, the goal is to infer the dynamic connections (or time-varying conditional dependencies) among multiple functions or time series. For this task, a dynamic and Bayesian functional graphical model is introduced. The proposed modeling approach prioritizes the careful definition of an appropriate graph to identify both time-invariant and time-varying connectivity patterns. A novel block-structured sparsity prior is paired with a finite basis expansion, which together yield effective shrinkage and graph selection with efficient computations via a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Crucially, the model includes (one or more) graph changepoints, which are learned jointly with all model parameters and incorporate graph dynamics. Simulation studies demonstrate excellent graph selection capabilities, with significant improvements over competing methods. The proposed approach is applied to study of dynamic connectivity patterns of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and reveals meaningful edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised for Computational Statistics and Data Analysis</p></details> |

However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin. In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%. The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.</p></details> |  |

While the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm performs dynamic smoothing based on local variation in a periodogram, the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm performs dynamic smoothing based on local departure from linearity in a periodogram. This article begins with a summary of the statistical foundations for both the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm and the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm, followed by instructions for accessing and utilizing these approaches within the R statistical program platform. Brief definitions, importance, statistical bases, theoretical and practical limits, and demonstrations are provided for their sensitivity, accuracy, resolution, and robustness in estimating signal frequencies. Next using a simulated time series in which two signals close in frequency are embedded in a significant level of random noise, the predictive power of these approaches are compared to the autoregressive integral moving average (ARIMA) approach, with support again garnered for their being robust when data is missing. Throughout, the article contrasts the limits of Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing to those of log-periodograms with static smoothing, while also comparing the performance of the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm to that of the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm. It concludes by delineating next steps to establish the precision with which Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing estimate signal strength.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 5 figures; updated title, expanded focus to dynamic smoothing with commensurate results, included comparisons to static smoothing limits</p></details> |

However, effectively capturing both the global sequence dependence and local detail features within time series data remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel generative self-supervised method called TimeDART, denoting Diffusion Auto-regressive Transformer for Time series forecasting. In TimeDART, we treat time series patches as basic modeling units. Specifically, we employ an self-attention based Transformer encoder to model the dependencies of inter-patches. Additionally, we introduce diffusion and denoising mechanisms to capture the detail locality features of intra-patch. Notably, we design a cross-attention-based denoising decoder that allows for adjustable optimization difficulty in the self-supervised task, facilitating more effective self-supervised pre-training. Furthermore, the entire model is optimized in an auto-regressive manner to obtain transferable representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeDART achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance compared to the most advanced competitive methods in forecasting tasks.

A similar storming occurred in Brazil in 2023. Although both attacks were instances in longer sequences of events, these have provided a testimony for many observers who had claimed that online actions, including the propagation of disinformation, have offline consequences. Soon after, a number of papers have been published about the relation between online disinformation and offline violence, among other related relations. Hitherto, the effects upon political protests have been unexplored. This paper thus evaluates such effects with a time series cross-sectional sample of 125 countries in a period between 2000 and 2019. The results are mixed. Based on Bayesian multi-level regression modeling, (i) there indeed is an effect between online disinformation and offline protests, but the effect is partially meditated by political polarization. The results are clearer in a sample of countries belonging to the European Economic Area. With this sample, (ii) offline protest counts increase from online disinformation disseminated by domestic governments, political parties, and politicians as well as by foreign governments. Furthermore, (iii) Internet shutdowns tend to decrease the counts, although, paradoxically, the absence of governmental online monitoring of social media tends to also decrease these. With these results, the paper contributes to the blossoming disinformation research by modeling the impact of disinformation upon offline phenomenon. The contribution is important due to the various policy measures planned or already enacted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Note ...</summary><p>Note that there is a divergence between this pre-print and the publisher's definite version available via the DOI.

Deep learning methods have become the mainstream research direction due to their excellent performance. However, new viewpoints have emerged in recent TSAD research. Deep learning is not required for TSAD due to limitations such as slow deep learning speed. The Broad Learning System (BLS) is a shallow network framework that benefits from its ease of optimization and speed. It has been shown to outperform machine learning approaches while remaining competitive with deep learning. Based on the current situation of TSAD, we propose the Contrastive Patch-based Broad Learning System (CPatchBLS). This is a new exploration of patching technique and BLS, providing a new perspective for TSAD. We construct Dual-PatchBLS as a base through patching and Simple Kernel Perturbation (SKP) and utilize contrastive learning to capture the differences between normal and abnormal data under different representations. To compensate for the temporal semantic loss caused by various patching, we propose CPatchBLS with model level integration, which takes advantage of BLS's fast feature to build model-level integration and improve model detection. Using five real-world series anomaly detection datasets, we confirmed the method's efficacy, outperforming previous deep learning and machine learning methods while retaining a high level of computing efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, Under review</p></details> |

While Transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies, their application to extended sequences is limited by computational inefficiencies and limited generalization. In this study, we propose KEDformer, a knowledge extraction-driven framework that integrates seasonal-trend decomposition to address these challenges. KEDformer leverages knowledge extraction methods that focus on the most informative weights within the self-attention mechanism to reduce computational overhead. Additionally, the proposed KEDformer framework decouples time series into seasonal and trend components. This decomposition enhances the model's ability to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term patterns. Extensive experiments on five public datasets from energy, transportation, and weather domains demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of KEDformer, providing an efficient solution for long-term time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Wavelet-based Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05244v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to best develop foundational models for time series forecasting remains an important open question. Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this effort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential input? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based tokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the space of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the input time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and finally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the forecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs, wavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting that simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark, including 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that WaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models for forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and performs on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically on each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities, achieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary metrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex temporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent pre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time series with varying frequencies evolving over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential. However, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks which hinders the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work, we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods in particular in time series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely dependence on human judgement, retraining, and shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We additionally design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity. The proposed methodology and quantitative metrics can be used to understand the reliability of interpretability methods results obtained in practical applications. In turn, they can be embedded within operational workflows in critical fields that require accurate interpretability results for e.g., regulatory policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version to match published version in Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

The proposed test statistic is based on the weighted periodogram operator, assuming that the elements of the spectral density operator family are invariant with respect to the group of isometries of the manifold. A Central Limit Theorem is derived to obtain the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the proposed test statistics operator under the null hypothesis. The rate of convergence to zero, in the Hilbert--Schmidt operator norm, of the bias of the integrated empirical second and fourth order cumulant spectral density operators is established under the alternative hypothesis. The consistency of the test is then derived, from the obtained consistency of the integrated weighted periodogram operator under LRD. Practical implementation of our testing approach is based on the random projection methodology. The frequency-varying Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion of invariant Gaussian random spectral Hilbert-Schmidt kernels on manifolds is considered for generation of random directions in the implementation of this methodology. A simulation study illustrates the main results regarding asymptotic normality and consistency, and the empirical size and power properties of the proposed testing approach.</p></details> | No comments |
| **[Assessing Similarity Measures for the Evaluation of Human-Robot Motion Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04820v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key area of research in Human-Robot Interaction is solving the human-robot correspondence problem, which asks how a robot can learn to reproduce a human motion demonstration when the human and robot have different dynamics and kinematic structures. Evaluating these correspondence problem solutions often requires the use of qualitative surveys that can be time consuming to design and administer. Additionally, qualitative survey results vary depending on the population of survey participants. In this paper, we propose the use of heterogeneous time-series similarity measures as a quantitative evaluation metric for evaluating motion correspondence to complement these qualitative surveys. To assess the suitability of these measures, we develop a behavioral cloning-based motion correspondence model, and evaluate it with a qualitative survey as well as quantitative measures. By comparing the resulting similarity scores with the human survey results, we identify Gromov Dynamic Time Warping as a promising quantitative measure for evaluating motion correspondence.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Time Series Forecasting with LLMs via Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04806v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) that are extensively trained on abundant text data, and customizing the input prompt to enable time series forecasting has received considerable attention. While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small twolayer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture. This study underscores the potential of RFI detection as a benchmark problem for SNN researchers, emphasizing the efficacy of SNNs in addressing complex time-series segmentation tasks in radio astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

| **[An Efficient Model Maintenance Approach for MLOps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04657v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, many industries have utilized machine learning models (ML) in their systems. Ideally, machine learning models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to data and concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up to date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource intensive, costly, time consuming, and model dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent retraining. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on four time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the performance of models while significantly reducing maintenance time and costs. Our model reuse approach achieves ML performance comparable to the best baseline, while being 15 times more efficient in terms of computation time and costs. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain the performance of their ML models in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 Pa...</summary><p>34 Pages, 25 Figures, 12 Tables, 1 Algorithm, Submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Some PNAs have also shown emergent domain wall dynamics. Previous works have demonstrated methods to physically probe these magnetization dynamics of PNAs to realize neuromorphic reservoir systems that exhibit chaotic dynamical behavior and high-dimensional nonlinearity. These PNA reservoir systems from prior works leverage echo state properties and linear/nonlinear short-term memory of component reservoir nodes to map and preserve the dynamical information of the input time-series data into nondelay spatial embeddings. Such mappings enable these PNA reservoir systems to imitate and predict/forecast the input time series data. However, these prior PNA reservoir systems are based solely on the nondelay spatial embeddings obtained at component reservoir nodes. As a result, they require a massive number of component reservoir nodes, or a very large spatial embedding (i.e., high-dimensional spatial embedding) per reservoir node, or both, to achieve acceptable imitation and prediction accuracy. These requirements reduce the practical feasibility of such PNA reservoir systems. To address this shortcoming, we present a mixed delay/nondelay embeddings-based PNA reservoir system. Our system uses a single PNA reservoir node with the ability to obtain a mixture of delay/nondelay embeddings of the dynamical information of the time-series data applied at the input of a single PNA reservoir node. Our analysis shows that when these mixed delay/nondelay embeddings are used to train a perceptron at the output layer, our reservoir system outperforms existing PNA-based reservoir systems for the imitation of NARMA 2, NARMA 5, NARMA 7, and NARMA 10 time series data, and for the short-term and long-term prediction of the Mackey Glass time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving High-dimensional Inverse Problems Using Amortized Likelihood-free Inference with Noisy and Incomplete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04565v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel likelihood-free probabilistic inversion method based on normalizing flows for high-dimensional inverse problems. The proposed method is comprised of two complementary networks: a summary network for data compression, and an inference network for parameter estimation. The summary network encodes raw observations into a fixed-size vector of summary statistics, while the inference network generates samples of the approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters based on these summary statistics. The posterior samples are produced in a deep generative fashion by sampling from a latent Gaussian distribution and passing these samples through an invertible transformation. We construct this invertible transformation by sequentially alternating conditional invertible neural network (cINN) and conditional neural spline flow (cNSF) layers. The summary and inference networks are trained simultaneously. We apply the proposed method to an inversion problem in groundwater hydrology to estimate the posterior distribution of the system's log-conductivity field conditioned on spatially sparse time-series observations of the system's hydraulic head responses. The conductivity field is represented with 706 degrees of freedom in the considered problem. The comparison with the likelihood-based iterative ensemble smoother PEST-IES method demonstrates that the proposed method accurately estimates the parameter posterior distribution and the observations' predictive posterior distribution at a fraction of the inference time of PEST-IES.</p></details> |  |

This paper studies machine learning that detect drifts in process curve datasets. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning algorithms for process drift detection. An evaluation score, called the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated with the introduced framework is presented that shows that existing algorithms often struggle with datasets containing multiple drift segments.</p></details> |  |
| **[WinTSR: A Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling Method for Interpreting Time Series Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04532v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting complex time series forecasting models is challenging due to the temporal dependencies between time steps and the dynamic relevance of input features over time. Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method called Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR) addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outranks the other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel and open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact: Exploring Space-Time Perceptive Clues for Weakly Supervised Satellite Image Time Series Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03968v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated crop mapping through Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) has emerged as a crucial avenue for agricultural monitoring and management. However, due to the low resolution and unclear parcel boundaries, annotating pixel-level masks is exceptionally complex and time-consuming in SITS. This paper embraces the weakly supervised paradigm (i.e., only image-level categories available) to liberate the crop mapping task from the exhaustive annotation burden. The unique characteristics of SITS give rise to several challenges in weakly supervised learning: (1) noise perturbation from spatially neighboring regions, and (2) erroneous semantic bias from anomalous temporal periods. To address the above difficulties, we propose a novel method, termed exploring space-time perceptive clues (Exact). First, we introduce a set of spatial clues to explicitly capture the representative patterns of different crops from the most class-relative regions. Besides, we leverage the temporal-to-class interaction of the model to emphasize the contributions of pivotal clips, thereby enhancing the model perception for crop regions. Build upon the space-time perceptive clues, we derive the clue-based CAMs to effectively supervise the SITS segmentation network. Our method demonstrates impressive performance on various SITS benchmarks. Remarkably, the segmentation network trained on Exact-generated masks achieves 95% of its fully supervised performance, showing the bright promise of weakly supervised paradigm in crop mapping scenario. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. Code will be available at https://github.com/MiSsU-HH/Exact</p></details> |

For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |

Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a foundational time-series model from multi-domain time-series datasets: extracting semantically useful tokenized inputs to the model across heterogenous time-series from different domains. We propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) that introduces a novel method of adaptive segmentation that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy during pre-training. This enables LPTM to perform similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model when fine-tuned to different downstream time-series analysis tasks and under zero-shot settings. LPTM achieves superior forecasting and time-series classification results taking up to 40% less data and 50% less training time compared to state-of-art baselines.

To identify conditional correlation structures under varying market conditions and accommodate stylized facts embedded in financial time series, we rely upon the generalized hyperbolic family of distributions with time-dependent parameters evolving according to a latent Markov chain. We exploit its location-scale mixture representation to build a penalized EM algorithm for estimating the state-specific sparse precision matrices by means of an $L_1$ penalty. The proposed approach leads to regime-specific conditional correlation graphs that allow us to identify different degrees of network connectivity of returns over time. The methodology's effectiveness is validated through simulation exercises under different scenarios. In the empirical analysis we apply our model to daily returns of a large set of market indexes, cryptocurrencies and commodity futures over the period 2017-2023.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths. We show that our model learns a latent representation that reflects specific time-series features (e.g. slope, frequency), as well as outperforming GPT-4o on a set of zero-shot reasoning tasks on a variety of domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation at 2024 NeurIPS Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models</p></details> |

We introduce a novel random initialization algorithm, designed to take advantage of the structure of the ARMA likelihood function, which overcomes these optimization problems. Additionally, we show that profile confidence intervals provide superior confidence intervals to those based on the Fisher information matrix.

In these cases, when multiple incoherent base forecasts for each individual variable are available, a forecast combination-and-reconciliation approach, that we call coherent forecast combination, may be used to improve the accuracy of the base forecasts and achieve coherence in the final result. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based technique that combines multiple unbiased base forecasts while assuring the constraints valid for the series. We present closed form expressions for the coherent combined forecast vector and its error covariance matrix in the general case where a different number of forecasts is available for each variable. We also discuss practical issues related to the covariance matrix that is part of the optimal solution. Through simulations and a forecasting experiment on the daily Australian electricity generation hierarchical time series, we show that the proposed methodology, in addition to adhering to sound statistical principles, may yield in significant improvement on base forecasts, single-task combination and single-expert reconciliation approaches as well.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models have demonstrated remarkable transfer capabilities across various domains, their effectiveness in handling individual-specific physiological signals - crucial for precision medicine - remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a systematic pipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer capabilities in medical contexts. Our pipeline employs a three-stage approach. First, it leverages physiological simulation software to generate diverse, clinically relevant scenarios, particularly focusing on data-scarce medical conditions. This simulation-based approach enables both targeted capability assessment and subsequent model fine-tuning. Second, the pipeline projects these simulated signals through the foundation model to obtain embeddings, which are then evaluated using linear methods. This evaluation quantifies the model's ability to capture three critical aspects: physiological feature independence, temporal dynamics preservation, and medical scenario differentiation. Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through specific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the Moirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in physiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal dynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination. These findings suggest that current foundation models may require substantial architectural modifications or targeted fine-tuning before deployment in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the precision medicine workshop at the AI in Medicine conference (2024) in Salt Lake City</p></details> |

Despite an abundance of research on NAS for images and natural language applications, similar studies for time series data are lacking. Among NAS search spaces, chain-structured are the simplest and most applicable to small datasets like time series. We compare three popular NAS strategies on chain-structured search spaces: Bayesian optimization (specifically Tree-structured Parzen Estimator), the hyperband method, and reinforcement learning in the context of financial time series forecasting. These strategies were employed to optimize simple well-understood neural architectures like the MLP, 1D CNN, and RNN, with more complex temporal fusion transformers (TFT) and their own optimizers included for comparison. We find Bayesian optimization and the hyperband method performing best among the strategies, and RNN and 1D CNN best among the architectures, but all methods were very close to each other with a high variance due to the difficulty of working with financial datasets. We discuss our approach to overcome the variance and provide implementation recommendations for future users and researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the paper published in International Journal of Data Science and Analytics</p></details> |

The bank stability index is an important indicator to measure the health status and risk resistance of financial institutions. Traditional prediction methods are difficult to adapt to complex market changes because they rely on single-dimensional macroeconomic data. This paper proposes a prediction framework based on the Time Series Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism of the model to capture the complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships in financial data. Through experiments, we compare the model with LSTM, GRU, CNN, TCN and RNN-Transformer models. The experimental results show that the Time Series Transformer model outperforms other models in both mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) evaluation indicators, showing strong prediction ability. This shows that the Time Series Transformer model can better handle multidimensional time series data in bank stability prediction, providing new technical approaches and solutions for financial risk management.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[UTSD: Unified Time Series Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03068v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have achieved unprecedented success in time series analysis. However, facing the challenge of across-domain modeling, existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a Unified Time Series Diffusion (UTSD) model is established for the first time to model the multi-domain probability distribution, utilizing the powerful probability distribution modeling ability of Diffusion. Unlike the autoregressive models that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the historical sequence, we use a diffusion denoising process to model the mixture distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed UTSD contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) The diffusion and denoising process on the actual sequence space, combined with the improved classifier free guidance as the conditional generation strategy, greatly improves the stability and accuracy of the downstream task. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, and the pre-trained UTSD outperforms existing foundation models on all data domains, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization ability. After training from scratch, UTSD achieves comparable performance against domain-specific proprietary models. The empirical results validate the potential of UTSD as a time series foundational model.</p></details> |  |

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We view SCR as providing in their state space feature representations of the input-driving time series. By endowing the state space with the canonical dot-product, we ``reverse engineer" the corresponding kernel (inner product) operating in the original time series space. The action of this time-series kernel is fully characterized by the eigenspace of the corresponding metric tensor. We demonstrate that when linear SCRs are constructed at the edge of stability, the eigenvectors of the time-series kernel align with the Fourier basis. This theoretical insight is supported by numerical experiments.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Higher Order Transformers: Efficient Attention Mechanism for Tensor Structured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02919v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are now ubiquitous for sequence modeling tasks, but their extension to multi-dimensional data remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of the attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose Higher-Order Transformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data with more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the computational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we introduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the attention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in the total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT leverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This strategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention computation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive performance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing its potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.</p></details> |  |

However, identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimental data remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In this study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an Integral Square Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99 for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamic equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian inference on the order of stationary vector autoregressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05708v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector autoregressions (VARs) are a widely used tool for modelling multivariate time-series. It is common to assume a VAR is stationary; this can be enforced by imposing the stationarity condition which restricts the parameter space of the autoregressive coefficients to the stationary region. However, implementing this constraint is difficult due to the complex geometry of the stationary region. Fortunately, recent work has provided a solution for autoregressions of fixed order $p$ based on a reparameterization in terms of a set of interpretable and unconstrained transformed partial autocorrelation matrices. In this work, focus is placed on the difficult problem of allowing $p$ to be unknown, developing a prior and computational inference that takes full account of order uncertainty. Specifically, the multiplicative gamma process is used to build a prior which encourages increasing shrinkage of the partial autocorrelations with increasing lag. Identifying the lag beyond which the partial autocorrelations become equal to zero then determines $p$. Based on classic time-series theory, a principled choice of truncation criterion identifies whether a partial autocorrelation matrix is effectively zero. Posterior inference utilizes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via Stan. The work is illustrated in a substantive application to neural activity data to investigate ultradian brain rhythms.</p></details> |  |

However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bi-Level Optimization Approach to Joint Trajectory Optimization for Redundant Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07859v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present an approach to minimizing the time necessary for the end-effector of a redundant robot manipulator to traverse a Cartesian path by optimizing the trajectory of its joints. Each joint has limits in the ranges of position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions, this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach with simulations and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 pictures</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[POMDP-Based Trajectory Planning for On-Ramp Highway Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07567v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for automated vehicle on-ramp highway merging. To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally, we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle, combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various automated driving problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[When UAV Meets Federated Learning: Latency Minimization via Joint Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07428v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal solution for training machine learning models over wireless networks, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation resources. Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Control-Aware Trajectory Predictions for Communication-Efficient Drone Swarm Coordination in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12852v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have demonstrated enormous potential in many industrial and commercial applications. However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model predictive control-based trajectory generation for agile landing of unmanned aerial vehicle on a moving boat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07332v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel trajectory generation method based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for agile landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) onto an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)'s deck in harsh conditions. The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 17 figures, Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter Adjustments in POMDP-Based Trajectory Planning for Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06405v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections, specifically focusing on scenarios where the vehicle lacks the right of way and yet must cross safely. To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

We automatically determine the perturbation magnitude through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process.

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04184v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.</p></details> | 16 |

The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[Abstraction-based Control of Unknown Continuous-Space Models with Just Two Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03892v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) offer an effective scheme for approximating the complex continuous-space systems with simpler models in the discrete-space domain. A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal relation between the original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a discrete controller designed for the symbolic model can be effectively implemented as a hybrid controller (using an interface map) for the original system. This task becomes even more challenging when the exact mathematical model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To address this, the existing literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven methods, which require collecting a large amount of data from the original system. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state trajectories collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a hybrid controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the concept of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness between the state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven symbolic model. By satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data, which intuitively ensures that the unknown system is persistently excited, we directly design an ASF and its corresponding hybrid controller using finite-length data without explicitly identifying the unknown system, while providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach through a case study.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while significantly narrowing down the performance gap with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kmcode1.github.io/Projects/SG-I2V/</p></details> |
| **[PathletRL++: Optimizing Trajectory Pathlet Extraction and Dictionary Formation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03715v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in tracking technologies have spurred the rapid growth of large-scale trajectory data. Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03195v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference Research (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Trajectory Classification and Landmark Inference on Simplicial Complexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03145v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of classifying trajectories on a discrete or discretised 2-dimensional manifold modelled by a simplicial complex. Previous works have proposed to project the trajectories into the harmonic eigenspace of the Hodge Laplacian, and then cluster the resulting embeddings. However, if the considered space has vanishing homology (i.e., no "holes"), then the harmonic space of the 1-Hodge Laplacian is trivial and thus the approach fails. Here we propose to view this issue akin to a sensor placement problem and present an algorithm that aims to learn "optimal holes" to distinguish a set of given trajectory classes. Specifically, given a set of labelled trajectories, which we interpret as edge-flows on the underlying simplicial complex, we search for 2-simplices whose deletion results in an optimal separation of the trajectory labels according to the corresponding spectral embedding of the trajectories into the harmonic space. Finally, we generalise this approach to the unsupervised setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at the 58th Annual Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2024</p></details> |

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-transmotion.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

Traditionally, this task relies on sequence modeling and behavior analysis techniques applied to tabular or video-based data, but these methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture partial matching. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pairwise spatiotemporal partial trajectory matching that transforms tabular spatiotemporal data into interpretable trajectory images based on specified time windows, allowing for partial trajectory analysis. This approach includes localization of trajectories, checking for spatial overlap, and pairwise matching using a Siamese Neural Network. We evaluate our method on a co-walking classification task, demonstrating its effectiveness in a novel co-behavior identification application. Our model surpasses established methods, achieving an F1-score up to 0.73. Additionally, we explore the method's utility for pair routine pattern analysis in real-world scenarios, providing insights into the frequency, timing, and duration of shared behaviors. This approach offers a powerful, interpretable framework for spatiotemporal behavior analysis, with potential applications in social behavior research, urban planning, and healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission. 17 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

Despite researchers' efforts, it remains a challenge to accurately account for social interactions among agents when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate such social modifications to future trajectories in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by the resonance phenomenon of vibration systems, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to forecast pedestrian trajectories as co-vibrations, and regard that social interactions are associated with spectral properties of agents' trajectories. It forecasts future trajectories as three distinct vibration terms to represent agents' future plans from different perspectives in a decoupled way. Also, agents' social interactions and how they modify scheduled trajectories will be considered in a resonance-like manner by learning the similarities of their trajectory spectrums. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrian or vehicle, have verified the usefulness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

The complex interactions brought by different relations between agents are a crucial reason that poses challenges to this task. Researchers have put much effort into designing a system using rule-based or data-based models to extract and validate the patterns between pedestrian trajectories and these interactions, which has not been adequately addressed yet. Inspired by how humans perceive social interactions with different level of relations to themself, this work proposes the GrouP ConCeption (short for GPCC) model composed of the Group method, which categorizes nearby agents into either group members or non-group members based on a long-term distance kernel function, and the Conception module, which perceives both visual and acoustic information surrounding the target agent. Evaluated across multiple datasets, the GPCC model demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory prediction accuracy, validating its effectiveness in modeling both social and individual dynamics. The qualitative analysis also indicates that the GPCC framework successfully leverages grouping and perception cues human-like intuitively to validate the proposed model's explainability in pedestrian trajectory forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, submitted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Latent Goal by Learning from Trajectory Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02125v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A glowing body of work has emerged focusing on instruction-following policies for open-world agents, aiming to better align the agent's behavior with human intentions. However, the performance of these policies is highly susceptible to the initial prompt, which leads to extra efforts in selecting the best instructions. We propose a framework named Preference Goal Tuning (PGT). PGT allows an instruction following policy to interact with the environment to collect several trajectories, which will be categorized into positive and negative samples based on preference. Then we use preference learning to fine-tune the initial goal latent representation with the categorized trajectories while keeping the policy backbone frozen. The experiment result shows that with minimal data and training, PGT achieves an average relative improvement of 72.0% and 81.6% over 17 tasks in 2 different foundation policies respectively, and outperforms the best human-selected instructions. Moreover, PGT surpasses full fine-tuning in the out-of-distribution (OOD) task-execution environments by 13.4%, indicating that our approach retains strong generalization capabilities. Since our approach stores a single latent representation for each task independently, it can be viewed as an efficient method for continual learning, without the risk of catastrophic forgetting or task interference. In short, PGT enhances the performance of agents across nearly all tasks in the Minecraft Skillforge benchmark and demonstrates robustness to the execution environment.</p></details> |  |

More and more trajectories with different forms, such as coordinates, bounding boxes, and even high-dimensional human skeletons, need to be analyzed and forecasted. Among these heterogeneous trajectories, interactions between different elements within a frame of trajectory, which we call ``Dimension-wise Interactions'', would be more complex and challenging. However, most previous approaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, and potential dimension-wise interactions are less concerned. In this work, we expand the trajectory prediction task by introducing the trajectory dimensionality $M$, thus extending its application scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories. We first introduce the Haar transform as an alternative to Fourier transform to better capture the time-frequency properties of each trajectory-dimension. Then, we adopt the bilinear structure to model and fuse two factors simultaneously, including the time-frequency response and the dimension-wise interaction, to forecast heterogeneous trajectories via trajectory spectrums hierarchically in a generic way. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on ETH-UCY, SDD, nuScenes, and Human3.6M with heterogeneous trajectories, including 2D coordinates, 2D/3D bounding boxes, and 3D human skeletons.</p></details> |  |

The reconnaissance phase is a low-altitude flyby to collect detailed information around a potential landing site. Although such autonomous deep-space exploration missions have garnered considerable interest recently, state-of-the-practice in trajectory design involves a time-intensive ground-based open-loop process that forward propagates multiple trajectories with a range of initial conditions and parameters to account for uncertainties in spacecraft knowledge and actuation.

We first use the Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT) simulation framework to rigorously validate the underlying modeling assumptions for our trajectory planner and then propose a method to transform this stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic one tailored for use with an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithmic approach through extensive numerical experiments and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-practice benchmark used for representative missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for 2025 AIAA SciTech Forum (also selected a finalist for the 2025 GNC Graduate Student Paper Competition)</p></details> |

While existing methods excel at novel view synthesis on recorded trajectories, they face challenges with novel trajectories due to limited views of driving videos and the vastness of driving environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel free-form driving view synthesis approach, dubbed DriveX, by leveraging video generative prior to optimize a 3D model across a variety of trajectories. Concretely, we crafted an inverse problem that enables a video diffusion model to be utilized as a prior for many-trajectory optimization of a parametric 3D model (e.g., Gaussian splatting). To seamlessly use the generative prior, we iteratively conduct this process during optimization. Our resulting model can produce high-fidelity virtual driving environments outside the recorded trajectory, enabling free-form trajectory driving simulation. Beyond real driving scenes, DriveX can also be utilized to simulate virtual driving worlds from AI-generated videos.</p></details> |  |

Through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, the customized trajectory representation is presented, which implies the equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and deduction of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into an uncon-strained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time com-plexity to further improve efficiency.

GPS trajectory data offers valuable information for ETA, but challenges arise due to temporal sparsity, variable sequence lengths, and the interdependencies among multiple trucks. To address these issues, we propose the Temporal-Attribute-Spatial Tri-space Coordination (TAS-TsC) framework, which leverages three feature spaces-temporal, attribute, and spatial-to enhance ETA. Our framework consists of a Temporal Learning Module (TLM) using state space models to capture temporal dependencies, an Attribute Extraction Module (AEM) that transforms sequential features into structured attribute embeddings, and a Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) that models the interactions among multiple trajectories using graph representation learning.These modules collaboratively learn trajectory embeddings, which are then used by a Downstream Prediction Module (DPM) to estimate arrival times. We validate TAS-TsC on real truck trajectory datasets collected from Shenzhen, China, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional studies often treat trajectory and traffic state data as distinct, independent modalities, each tailored to specific tasks within a single modality. However, real-world applications, such as navigation apps, require joint analysis of trajectory and traffic state data. Treating these data types as two separate domains can lead to suboptimal model performance. Although recent advances in ST data pre-training and ST foundation models aim to develop universal models for ST data analysis, most existing models are "multi-task, solo-data modality" (MTSM), meaning they can handle multiple tasks within either trajectory data or traffic state data, but not both simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper introduces BIGCity, the first multi-task, multi-data modality (MTMD) model for ST data analysis. The model targets two key challenges in designing an MTMD ST model: (1) unifying the representations of different ST data modalities, and (2) unifying heterogeneous ST analysis tasks. To overcome the first challenge, BIGCity introduces a novel ST-unit that represents both trajectories and traffic states in a unified format. Additionally, for the second challenge, BIGCity adopts a tunable large model with ST task-oriented prompt, enabling it to perform a range of heterogeneous tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BIGCity achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 tasks, outperforming 18 baselines. To the best of our knowledge, BIGCity is the first model capable of handling both trajectories and traffic states for diverse heterogeneous tasks.

Local differential privacy (LDP) provides provable privacy guarantees for users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory collection methods ensure LDP only for discrete location spaces, where the number of locations affects their privacy guarantees and trajectory utility. Moreover, the location space is often naturally continuous, such as in flying and sailing trajectories, making these methods unsuitable. This paper proposes two trajectory collection methods that ensure LDP for continuous spaces: TraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C, which perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are theoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility. TraCS can also be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the nearest discrete points. It is independent of the number of locations and has only $\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation results on discrete location spaces validate this advantage and show that TraCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility, especially for large privacy parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Dynamic Weight Adjustment for Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Planning in Crowd Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00555v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot navigation in dense human crowds poses a significant challenge due to the complexity of human behavior in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. In this work, we propose a dynamic weight adjustment scheme using a neural network to predict the optimal weights of objectives in an optimization-based motion planner. We adopt a spatial-temporal trajectory planner and incorporate diverse objectives to achieve a balance among safety, efficiency, and goal achievement in complex and dynamic environments. We design the network structure, observation encoding, and reward function to effectively train the policy network using reinforcement learning, allowing the robot to adapt its behavior in real time based on environmental and pedestrian information. Simulation results show improved safety compared to the fixed-weight planner and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods, and verify the ability of the learned policy to adaptively adjust the weights based on the observed situations. The approach's feasibility is demonstrated in a navigation task using an autonomous delivery robot across a crowded corridor over a 300 m distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

To address this issue, this paper leverages Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) for the efficient construction of Channel Knowledge Maps (CKM) and UAV trajectory design. Given the time-consuming nature of channel data collection, AI techniques are employed in a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to extract environmental features and augment the data. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving CKM construction accuracy. Moreover, integrating CKM into UAV trajectory planning reduces channel gain uncertainty, demonstrating its potential to enhance wireless communication efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We employ formal methods to describe and extract multi-agent interaction events, exposing the limitations of existing autonomous driving solutions. Additionally, we introduce a user-friendly toolkit enabling the expansion of InterHub with both public and private data. By unifying, categorizing, and analyzing diverse interaction events, InterHub facilitates cross-comparative studies and large-scale research, thereby advancing the evaluation and development of autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Loss Strategy for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction: Combining Off-Road, Diversity, and Directional Consistency Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19747v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning in autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments.

| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 fig...</summary><p>7 figures, 3 tables, 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Barrier-Enhanced Parallel Homotopic Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10441v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Attention for Fine-grained Video Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19324v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation have been greatly driven by video diffusion models, with camera motion control emerging as a crucial challenge in creating view-customized visual content. This paper introduces trajectory attention, a novel approach that performs attention along available pixel trajectories for fine-grained camera motion control. Unlike existing methods that often yield imprecise outputs or neglect temporal correlations, our approach possesses a stronger inductive bias that seamlessly injects trajectory information into the video generation process. Importantly, our approach models trajectory attention as an auxiliary branch alongside traditional temporal attention. This design enables the original temporal attention and the trajectory attention to work in synergy, ensuring both precise motion control and new content generation capability, which is critical when the trajectory is only partially available. Experiments on camera motion control for images and videos demonstrate significant improvements in precision and long-range consistency while maintaining high-quality generation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be extended to other video motion control tasks, such as first-frame-guided video editing, where it excels in maintaining content consistency over large spatial and temporal ranges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: xizaoqu.github.io/trajattn/</p></details> |
| **[Computationally efficient trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states. These results indicate that TEA captures critical, environment-specific characteristics, enabling RL agents to generalize effectively across dynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RED: Effective Trajectory Representation Learning with Comprehensive Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15096v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can then be used for various downstream tasks, including trajectory similarity computation, trajectory classification, and travel-time estimation. However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by VLDB2025</p></details> |
| **[Synergizing Decision Making and Trajectory Planning Using Two-Stage Optimization for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18974v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a local planner that synergizes the decision making and trajectory planning modules towards autonomous driving. The decision making and trajectory planning tasks are jointly formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with an integrated objective function. However, integrating the discrete decision variables into the continuous trajectory optimization leads to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with inherent nonlinearity and nonconvexity. To address the challenge in solving the problem, the original problem is decomposed into two sub-stages, and a two-stage optimization (TSO) based approach is presented to ensure the coherence in outcomes for the two stages. The optimization problem in the first stage determines the optimal decision sequence that acts as an informed initialization. With the outputs from the first stage, the second stage necessitates the use of a high-fidelity vehicle model and strict enforcement of the collision avoidance constraints as part of the trajectory planning problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed planner across diverse multi-lane scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner simultaneously generates a sequence of optimal decisions and the corresponding trajectory that significantly improves driving performance in terms of driving safety and traveling efficiency as compared to alternative methods. Additionally, we implement the closed-loop simulation in CARLA, and the results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed planner to adapt to changing driving situations with high computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory-planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Accurate prediction of dissection trajectories is crucial for better decision-making, reducing intraoperative errors, and improving surgical training. Nevertheless, predicting these trajectories is challenging due to variable tumor margins and dynamic visual conditions. To address this issue, we create the ESD Trajectory and Confidence Map-based Safety Margin (ETSM) dataset with $1849$ short clips, focusing on submucosal dissection with a dual-arm robotic system. We also introduce a framework that combines optimal dissection trajectory prediction with a confidence map-based safety margin, providing a more secure and intelligent decision-making tool to minimize surgical risks for ESD procedures. Additionally, we propose the Regression-based Confidence Map Prediction Network (RCMNet), which utilizes a regression approach to predict confidence maps for dissection areas, thereby delineating various levels of safety margins. We evaluate our RCMNet using three distinct experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, robustness assessment, and out-of-domain evaluation. Experimental results show that our approach excels in the confidence map-based safety margin prediction task, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of only $3.18$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a regression approach for visual guidance concerning delineating varying safety levels of dissection areas. Our approach bridges gaps in current research by improving prediction accuracy and enhancing the safety of the dissection process, showing great clinical significance in practice.</p></details> |  |

The trade-off is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial obstacles for small-scale aggregation. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We then deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases--self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data--to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant in tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, significantly reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets.

This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming (QP). Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including 1) single- and dual-target following and 2) both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the target's center, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable sets of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path topology, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable set among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This has fueled interest in developing intuitive tools that let users leverage video generation as world simulators. Text-to-video (T2V) generation is one such approach, enabling video creation from text descriptions only. Yet, due to the inherent ambiguity in texts and the limited temporal information offered by text prompts, researchers have explored additional control signals like trajectory-guided systems, for more accurate T2V generation. Nonetheless, methods to evaluate whether T2V models can generate realistic interactions between multiple objects are lacking. We introduce InTraGen, a pipeline for improved trajectory-based generation of object interaction scenarios. We propose 4 new datasets and a novel trajectory quality metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed InTraGen.

| **[A Parameter Adaptive Trajectory Tracking and Motion Control Framework for Autonomous Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17745v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the trajectory tracking and motion control problems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). A parameter adaptive control framework for AVs is proposed to enhance tracking accuracy and yaw stability. While establishing linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and three robust controllers, the control framework addresses trajectory tracking and motion control in a modular fashion, without introducing complexity into each controller. The robust performance has been guaranteed in three robust controllers by considering the parameter uncertainties, mismatch of unmodeled subsystem as well as external disturbance, comprehensively. Also, the dynamic characteristics of uncertain parameters are identified by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, while the boundaries of three robust factors are determined through combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian optimization machine learning methods, reducing the conservatism of the controller. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse robust factors are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically. The simulation results on MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim joint platform demonstrate that the proposed methodology considerably improves tracking accuracy, driving stability, and robust performance, guaranteeing the feasibility and capability of driving in extreme scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring the Heat: Rapid Trajectory Optimization with Pseudospectral Techniques and the Affine Geometric Heat Flow Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12962v2)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems in a time-efficient manner while adhering to constraints is a challenging task. This paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which discretizes one variable of the AGHF PDE, and converts the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which is computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim5$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.

Although deep learning-based approaches - especially those utilizing transformer-based and generative models - have markedly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions, they frequently overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions critical for real-world driving applications, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. To address the issue, this study introduces a scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction, which integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a generative framework, improving both the accuracy and plausibility of predicted trajectories. The model utilizes a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle dynamics by scaling noise with encoded historical features within the diffusion process. Particularly, it employs a cross-attention-based transformer architecture to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.11941</p></details> |

In this work, a learning-based control approach is introduced to unlock the versatility and adaptiveness of flapping-wing flight. We propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for a high degree-of-freedom (DoF) bird-inspired flapping-wing robot that allows for multimodal flight and agile trajectory tracking. Stability analysis was performed on the closed-loop system comprising of the flapping-wing system and the RL policy. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate that the RL-based controller can successfully learn complex wing trajectory patterns, achieve stable flight, switch between flight modes spontaneously, and track different trajectories under various aerodynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning and Control for Robotic Magnetic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14950v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic magnetic manipulation offers a minimally invasive approach to gastrointestinal examinations through capsule endoscopy. However, controlling such systems using external permanent magnets (EPM) is challenging due to nonlinear magnetic interactions, especially when there are complex navigation requirements such as avoidance of sensitive tissues. In this work, we present a novel trajectory planning and control method incorporating dynamics and navigation requirements, using a single EPM fixed to a robotic arm to manipulate an internal permanent magnet (IPM). Our approach employs a constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator that considers the dynamics of the IPM to generate optimal trajectories for both the EPM and IPM. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments, motivated by capsule endoscopy operations, demonstrate the robustness of the method, showcasing resilience to external disturbances and precise control under varying conditions. The experimental results show that the IPM reaches the goal position with a maximum mean error of 0.18 cm and a standard deviation of 0.21 cm. This work introduces a unified framework for constrained trajectory optimization in magnetic manipulation, directly incorporating both the IPM's dynamics and the EPM's manipulability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v3)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

Existing TRL methods use either grid trajectories, capturing movement in free space, or road trajectories, capturing movement in a road network, as input. We observe that the two types of trajectories are complementary, providing either region and location information or providing road structure and movement regularity. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal TRL method, dubbed GREEN, to jointly utilize Grid and Road trajectory Expressions for Effective representatioN learning. In particular, we transform raw GPS trajectories into both grid and road trajectories and tailor two encoders to capture their respective information. To align the two encoders such that they complement each other, we adopt a contrastive loss to encourage them to produce similar embeddings for the same raw trajectory and design a mask language model (MLM) loss to use grid trajectories to help reconstruct masked road trajectories. To learn the final trajectory representation, a dual-modal interactor is used to fuse the outputs of the two encoders via cross-attention. We compare GREEN with 7 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, finding that GREEN consistently outperforms all baselines and improves the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by an average of 15.99\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by KDD2025(August Cycle)</p></details> |

These models help aircraft detect conflict and plan avoidance maneuvers, which is especially important in Unmanned Aircraft systems (UAS) landing management due to the congested airspace near vertiports. In this paper, we propose a landing trajectory prediction model for UAS based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is a prestigious neural network that has been developed for many years. In previous research, GAN has achieved many state-of-the-art results in many generation tasks. The GAN consists of one neural network generator and a neural network discriminator. Because of the learning capacity of the neural networks, the generator is capable to understand the features of the sample trajectory. The generator takes the previous trajectory as input and outputs some random status of a flight. According to the results of the experiences, the proposed model can output more accurate predictions than the baseline method(GMR) in various datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, we also create a real UAV landing dataset that includes more than 2600 trajectories of drone control manually by real pilots.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, AIAA SCITECH 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Trajectory and Power Control in Ultra-Dense UAV Networks: A Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14052v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ultra-dense unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, it is challenging to coordinate the resource allocation and interference management among large-scale UAVs, for providing flexible and efficient service coverage to the ground users (GUs). In this paper, we propose a learning-based resource allocation scheme in an ultra-dense UAV communication network, where the GUs' service demands are time-varying with unknown distributions. We formulate the non-cooperative game among multiple co-channel UAVs as a stochastic game, where each UAV jointly optimizes its trajectory, user association, and downlink power control to maximize the expectation of its locally cumulative energy efficiency under the interference and energy constraints. To cope with the scalability issue in a large-scale network, we further formulate the problem as a mean-field game (MFG), which simplifies the interactions among the UAVs into a two-player game between a representative UAV and a mean-field. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the MFG, and propose a model-free mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm named maximum entropy mean-field deep Q network (ME-MFDQN) to solve the mean-field equilibrium in both fully and partially observable scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the performance can be further enhanced if the GUs' service demands exhibit higher temporal correlation or if the UAVs have wider observation capabilities over their nearby GUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

By converting the vehicle's position and velocity information from the Cartesian coordinate system to Frenet coordinate system, this method can more accurately describe the vehicle's deviation and travel distance relative to the center line of the road. The DDPG algorithm adopts the Actor-Critic framework, uses deep neural networks for strategy and value evaluation, and combines the experience replay mechanism and target network to improve the algorithm's stability and data utilization efficiency. Experimental results show that the DDPG algorithm based on Frenet coordinate system performs well in trajectory-tracking tasks in complex environments, achieves high-precision and stable path tracking, and demonstrates its application potential in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been employed in recommender systems due to their success in graph representation learning. However, dealing with the dynamic property of social network data is a challenge. This research presents a novel method that provides social recommendations by incorporating the dynamic property of social network data in a heterogeneous graph. The model aims to capture user preference over time without going through the complexities of a dynamic graph by adding period nodes to define users' long-term and short-term preferences and aggregating assigned edge weights. The model is applied to real-world data to argue its superior performance. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study GNN robustness to label noise, demonstrate GNN failure modes when models struggle to generalise on low-order graphs, low label coverage, or when a model is over-parameterized. We establish both empirical and theoretical links between GNN robustness and the reduction of the total Dirichlet Energy of learned node representations, which encapsulates the hypothesized GNN smoothness inductive bias. Finally, we introduce two training strategies to enhance GNN robustness: (1) by incorporating a novel inductive bias in the weight matrices through the removal of negative eigenvalues, connected to Dirichlet Energy minimization; (2) by extending to GNNs a loss penalty that promotes learned smoothness. Importantly, neither approach negatively impacts performance in noise-free settings, supporting our hypothesis that the source of GNNs robustness is their smoothness inductive bias.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, computing the preconditioner itself can be time-consuming and sensitive to hyper-parameters. Instead, we replace the hand-engineered algorithm with a graph neural network that is trained to approximate the matrix factorization directly. To apply the output of the neural network as a preconditioner, we propose an output activation function that guarantees that the predicted factorization is invertible. Further, applying a graph neural network architecture allows us to ensure that the output itself is sparse which is desirable from a computational standpoint.

Leading graph contrastive learning follows the classical scheme of contrastive learning, forcing model to identify the essential information from augmented views. However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</p></details> | MM' 24 |
| **[Rumor Detection on Social Media with Temporal Propagation Structure Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08316v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for detecting rumors on social media primarily focus on analyzing textual content, often struggling to capture the complexity of online interactions. Recent research has shifted towards leveraging graph neural networks to model the hierarchical conversation structure that emerges during rumor propagation. However, these methods tend to overlook the temporal aspect of rumor propagation and may disregard potential noise within the propagation structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates temporal information by constructing a weighted propagation tree, where the weight of each edge represents the time interval between connected posts. Drawing upon the theory of structural entropy, we transform this tree into a coding tree. This transformation aims to preserve the essential structure of rumor propagation while reducing noise. Finally, we introduce a recursive neural network to learn from the coding tree for rumor veracity prediction. Experimental results on two common datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | COLING'25 |

This leads to a paucity of optimal solution, constraining the effectiveness of conventional deep learning approaches. Most existing learning-based methods necessitate extensive optimal data and fail to exploit the potential benefits of suboptimal data that can be obtained with greater efficiency and effectiveness. Taking the multi-server multi-user computation offloading (MSCO) problem, which is widely observed in systems like Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, as a concrete scenario, we present a Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation (GDSG) method. This approach is designed to work with suboptimal datasets while converging to the optimal solution large probably. We transform the optimization issue into distribution-learning and offer a clear explanation of learning from suboptimal training datasets. We build GDSG as a multi-task diffusion model utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to acquire the distribution of high-quality solutions. We use a simple and efficient heuristic approach to obtain a sufficient amount of training data composed entirely of suboptimal solutions. In our implementation, we enhance the backbone GNN and achieve improved generalization. GDSG also reaches nearly 100\% task orthogonality, ensuring no interference between the discrete and continuous generation tasks. We further reveal that this orthogonality arises from the diffusion-related training loss, rather than the neural network architecture itself. The experiments demonstrate that GDSG surpasses other benchmark methods on both the optimal and suboptimal training datasets. The MSCO datasets has open-sourced at http://ieee-dataport.org/13824, as well as the GDSG algorithm codes at https://github.com/qiyu3816/GDSG.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods face challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small-object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates a DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thereby ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Additionally, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques were applied to DGNN-YOLO to provide model-agnostic interpretability and deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing its transparency and trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects.

| **[Representation Learning with Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15950v5)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have seen significant advancements with the influence of deep learning and graph neural networks, particularly in capturing complex user-item relationships. However, these graph-based recommenders heavily depend on ID-based data, potentially disregarding valuable textual information associated with users and items, resulting in less informative learned representations. Moreover, the utilization of implicit feedback data introduces potential noise and bias, posing challenges for the effectiveness of user preference learning. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) into traditional ID-based recommenders has gained attention, challenges such as scalability issues, limitations in text-only reliance, and prompt input constraints need to be addressed for effective implementation in practical recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework RLMRec that aims to enhance existing recommenders with LLM-empowered representation learning. It proposes a recommendation paradigm that integrates representation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of user behaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals, develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns the semantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborative relational signals through a cross-view alignment framework. This work further establish a theoretical foundation demonstrating that incorporating textual signals through mutual information maximization enhances the quality of representations. In our evaluation, we integrate RLMRec with state-of-the-art recommender models, while also analyzing its efficiency and robustness to noise data. Our implementation codes are available at https://github.com/HKUDS/RLMRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a WWW'24 full paper</p></details> |

And graph transformers address these issues through self-attention, yet face scalability and noise challenges on large-scale graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose GNNMoE, a universal model architecture for node classification. This architecture flexibly combines fine-grained message-passing operations with a mixture-of-experts mechanism to build feature encoding blocks. Furthermore, by incorporating soft and hard gating layers to assign the most suitable expert networks to each node, we enhance the model's expressive power and adaptability to different graph types. In addition, we introduce adaptive residual connections and an enhanced FFN module into GNNMoE, further improving the expressiveness of node representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GNNMoE performs exceptionally well across various types of graph data, effectively alleviating the over-smoothing issue and global noise, enhancing model robustness and adaptability, while also ensuring computational efficiency on large-scale graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11189</p></details> |
| **[Towards Data-centric Machine Learning on Directed Graphs: a Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01849v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advances in processing structured data. However, most of them primarily adopted a model-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting them into undirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently limited in real-world applications due to the unavoidable information loss in simple undirected graphs and the model optimization challenges that arise when exceeding the upper bounds of this sub-optimal data representational capacity. As a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize improving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of graphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer distinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships, and directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a comprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular focus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel taxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from the data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving data representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed graphs and their quality plays a crucial role in model performance. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+ domains, highlighting their broad applicability. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges within the field, offering insights that can guide future research and development in directed graph learning.</p></details> | In Progress |
| **[Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08174v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</p></details> | Preprint, 26 pages |

Nevertheless, the structure incompleteness, noise, and redundancy result in poor robustness for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs). Dynamic Graph Structure Learning (DGSL) offers a promising way to optimize graph structures. However, aside from encountering unacceptable quadratic complexity, it overly relies on heuristic priors, making it hard to discover underlying predictive patterns. How to efficiently refine the dynamic structures, capture intrinsic dependencies, and learn robust representations, remains under-explored. In this work, we propose the novel DG-Mamba, a robust and efficient Dynamic Graph structure learning framework with the Selective State Space Models (Mamba). To accelerate the spatio-temporal structure learning, we propose a kernelized dynamic message-passing operator that reduces the quadratic time complexity to linear. To capture global intrinsic dynamics, we establish the dynamic graph as a self-contained system with State Space Model. By discretizing the system states with the cross-snapshot graph adjacency, we enable the long-distance dependencies capturing with the selective snapshot scan. To endow learned dynamic structures more expressive with informativeness, we propose the self-supervised Principle of Relevant Information for DGSL to regularize the most relevant yet least redundant information, enhancing global robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the robustness and efficiency of our DG-Mamba compared with the state-of-the-art baselines against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations:from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23748v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs. While graph kernel methods such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) kernels are effective in capturing similarity relationships, they rely heavily on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearity for more complex data patterns. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Cluster-Enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08066v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personal interaction data can be effectively modeled as individual graphs for each user in recommender systems.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation techniques have become extremely popular since they can capture high-order collaborative signals between users and items by aggregating the individual graph into a global interactive graph.However, this centralized approach inherently poses a threat to user privacy and security. Recently, federated GNN-based recommendation techniques have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate privacy concerns. Nevertheless, current implementations either limit on-device training to an unaccompanied individual graphs or necessitate reliance on an extra third-party server to touch other individual graphs, which also increases the risk of privacy leakage. To address this challenge, we propose a Cluster-enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network framework for Recommendation, named CFedGR, which introduces high-order collaborative signals to augment individual graphs in a privacy preserving manner. Specifically, the server clusters the pretrained user representations to identify high-order collaborative signals. In addition, two efficient strategies are devised to reduce communication between devices and the server. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

We present Matbench Discovery, an evaluation framework for ML energy models, applied as pre-filters for high-throughput searches of stable inorganic crystals. This framework addresses the disconnect between thermodynamic stability and formation energy, as well as retrospective vs. prospective benchmarking in materials discovery. We release a Python package to support model submissions and maintain an online leaderboard, offering insights into performance trade-offs. To identify the best-performing ML methodologies for materials discovery, we benchmarked various approaches, including random forests, graph neural networks (GNNs), one-shot predictors, iterative Bayesian optimizers, and universal interatomic potentials (UIP). Our initial results rank models by test set F1 scores for thermodynamic stability prediction: EquiformerV2 + DeNS > Orb > SevenNet > MACE > CHGNet > M3GNet > ALIGNN > MEGNet > CGCNN > CGCNN+P > Wrenformer > BOWSR > Voronoi fingerprint random forest. UIPs emerge as the top performers, achieving F1 scores of 0.57-0.82 and discovery acceleration factors (DAF) of up to 6x on the first 10k stable predictions compared to random selection. We also identify a misalignment between regression metrics and task-relevant classification metrics. Accurate regressors can yield high false-positive rates near the decision boundary at 0 eV/atom above the convex hull. Our results demonstrate UIPs' ability to optimize computational budget allocation for expanding materials databases. However, their limitations remain underexplored in traditional benchmarks. We advocate for task-based evaluation frameworks, as implemented here, to address these limitations and advance ML-guided materials discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please see online leaderboard at: https://matbench-discovery.materialsproject.org/</p></details> |

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, leading us to new frontiers in chemical understanding and discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML) as a novel approach tailored for molecules, showcasing its potential to advance the field of chemistry. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and TDC. ACML exhibits its capability to revolutionize chemical research and applications, providing a deeper understanding of the chemical semantics of different modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

With a long history in network science, community detection typically relies on objective functions, optimised with custom-tailored search algorithms, but often without leveraging recent advances in deep learning. Recently, first works have started incorporating such objectives into loss functions for deep graph clustering and pooling. We consider the map equation, a popular information-theoretic objective function for unsupervised community detection, and express it in differentiable tensor form for optimisation through gradient descent. Our formulation turns the map equation compatible with any neural network architecture, enables end-to-end learning, incorporates node features, and chooses the optimal number of clusters automatically, all without requiring explicit regularisation. Applied to unsupervised graph clustering tasks, we achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art deep graph clustering baselines in synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-relational nature of Graph neural networks (GNNs) make it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for well-known structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for GNNs employing diagnostic classifiers. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 22 figures, conference</p></details> |

| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Node Generation in Few-Shot Learning on Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09872v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs have recently garnered significant attention due to their wide range of applications in web domains. Existing methodologies employ word embedding models for acquiring text representations as node features, which are subsequently fed into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for training. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced their powerful capabilities in information retrieval and text generation, which can greatly enhance the text attributes of graph data. Furthermore, the acquisition and labeling of extensive datasets are both costly and time-consuming endeavors. Consequently, few-shot learning has emerged as a crucial problem in the context of graph learning tasks. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a lightweight paradigm called LLM4NG, which adopts a plug-and-play approach to empower text-attributed graphs through node generation using LLMs. Specifically, we utilize LLMs to extract semantic information from the labels and generate samples that belong to these categories as exemplars. Subsequently, we employ an edge predictor to capture the structural information inherent in the raw dataset and integrate the newly generated samples into the original graph. This approach harnesses LLMs for enhancing class-level information and seamlessly introduces labeled nodes and edges without modifying the raw dataset, thereby facilitating the node classification task in few-shot scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed paradigm, particularly in low-shot scenarios. For instance, in the 1-shot setting of the ogbn-arxiv dataset, LLM4NG achieves a 76% improvement over the baseline model.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Fast Track to Winning Tickets: Repowering One-Shot Pruning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07605v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate superior performance in various graph learning tasks, yet their wider real-world application is hindered by the computational overhead when applied to large-scale graphs. To address the issue, the Graph Lottery Hypothesis (GLT) has been proposed, advocating the identification of subgraphs and subnetworks, \textit{i.e.}, winning tickets, without compromising performance. The effectiveness of current GLT methods largely stems from the use of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), which offers higher stability and better performance than one-shot pruning. However, identifying GLTs is highly computationally expensive, due to the iterative pruning and retraining required by IMP. In this paper, we reevaluate the correlation between one-shot pruning and IMP: while one-shot tickets are suboptimal compared to IMP, they offer a \textit{fast track} to tickets with a stronger performance. We introduce a one-shot pruning and denoising framework to validate the efficacy of the \textit{fast track}. Compared to current IMP-based GLT methods, our framework achieves a double-win situation of graph lottery tickets with \textbf{higher sparsity} and \textbf{faster speeds}. Through extensive experiments across 4 backbones and 6 datasets, our method demonstrates $1.32\% - 45.62\%$ improvement in weight sparsity and a $7.49\% - 22.71\%$ increase in graph sparsity, along with a $1.7-44 \times$ speedup over IMP-based methods and $95.3\%-98.6\%$ MAC savings.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

| **[AHSG: Adversarial Attacks on High-level Semantics in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07468v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant interest among researchers due to their impressive performance in graph learning tasks. However, like other deep neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In existing adversarial attack methods for GNNs, the metric between the attacked graph and the original graph is usually the attack budget or a measure of global graph properties. However, we have found that it is possible to generate attack graphs that disrupt the primary semantics even within these constraints. To address this problem, we propose a Adversarial Attacks on High-level Semantics in Graph Neural Networks (AHSG), which is a graph structure attack model that ensures the retention of primary semantics. The latent representations of each node can extract rich semantic information by applying convolutional operations on graph data. These representations contain both task-relevant primary semantic information and task-irrelevant secondary semantic information. The latent representations of same-class nodes with the same primary semantics can fulfill the objective of modifying secondary semantics while preserving the primary semantics. Finally, the latent representations with attack effects is mapped to an attack graph using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm. By attacking graph deep learning models with some advanced defense strategies, we validate that AHSG has superior attack effectiveness compared to other attack methods. Additionally, we employ Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs) as a proxy for the primary semantics to detect the attacked graph, confirming that AHSG almost does not disrupt the original primary semantics of the graph.</p></details> |  |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multigraph Message Passing with Bi-Directional Multi-Edge Aggregations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00241v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have seen significant advances in recent years, yet their application to multigraphs, where parallel edges exist between the same pair of nodes, remains under-explored. Standard GNNs, designed for simple graphs, compute node representations by combining all connected edges at once, without distinguishing between edges from different neighbors. There are some GNN architectures proposed specifically for multigraphs, yet these architectures perform only node-level aggregation in their message passing layers, which limits their expressive power. Furthermore, these approaches either lack permutation equivariance when a strict total edge ordering is absent, or fail to preserve the topological structure of the multigraph. To address all these shortcomings, we propose MEGA-GNN, a unified framework for message passing on multigraphs that can effectively perform diverse graph learning tasks. Our approach introduces a two-stage aggregation process in the message passing layers: first, parallel edges are aggregated, followed by a node-level aggregation of messages from distinct neighbors. We show that MEGA-GNN is not only permutation equivariant but also universal given a strict total ordering on the edges. Experiments show that MEGA-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to 13\% on Anti-Money Laundering datasets and is on par with their accuracy on real-world phishing classification datasets in terms of minority class F1 score.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Given their substantial empirical success, there is an escalating interest in TGNNs within the research community. However, the majority of these efforts have been channelled towards algorithm and system design, with the evaluation metrics receiving comparatively less attention. Effective evaluation metrics are crucial for providing detailed performance insights, particularly in the temporal domain. This paper investigates the commonly used evaluation metrics for TGNNs and illustrates the failure mechanisms of these metrics in capturing essential temporal structures in the predictive behaviour of TGNNs. We provide a mathematical formulation of existing performance metrics and utilize an instance-based study to underscore their inadequacies in identifying volatility clustering (the occurrence of emerging errors within a brief interval). This phenomenon has profound implications for both algorithm and system design in the temporal domain. To address this deficiency, we introduce a new volatility-aware evaluation metric (termed volatility cluster statistics), designed for a more refined analysis of model temporal performance. Additionally, we demonstrate how this metric can serve as a temporal-volatility-aware training objective to alleviate the clustering of temporal errors. Through comprehensive experiments on various TGNN models, we validate our analysis and the proposed approach. The empirical results offer revealing insights: 1) existing TGNNs are prone to making errors with volatility clustering, and 2) TGNNs with different mechanisms to capture temporal information exhibit distinct volatility clustering patterns. Our empirical findings demonstrate that our proposed training objective effectively reduces volatility clusters in error.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we approach the oversmoothing problem from a dynamical systems perspective, providing a deeper understanding of the stability and convergence behavior of GNNs. Leveraging insights from dynamical systems theory, we identify the root causes of oversmoothing and propose \textbf{\textit{DYNAMO-GAT}}. This approach utilizes noise-driven covariance analysis and Anti-Hebbian principles to selectively prune redundant attention weights, dynamically adjusting the network's behavior to maintain node feature diversity and stability. Our theoretical analysis reveals how DYNAMO-GAT disrupts the convergence to oversmoothed states, while experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional and state-of-the-art methods. DYNAMO-GAT not only advances the theoretical understanding of oversmoothing through the lens of dynamical systems but also provides a practical and effective solution for improving the stability and expressiveness of deep GNNs.</p></details> | 26 pages |

While their performance is often attributed to the powerful neighborhood aggregation mechanism, recent studies suggest that other components such as non-linear layers may also significantly affecting how GNNs process the input graph data in the spectral domain. Such evidence challenges the prevalent opinion that neighborhood aggregation mechanisms dominate the behavioral characteristics of GNNs in the spectral domain. To demystify such a conflict, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark to measure and evaluate GNNs' capability in capturing and leveraging the information encoded in different frequency components of the input graph data. Specifically, we first conduct an exploratory study demonstrating that GNNs can flexibly yield outputs with diverse frequency components even when certain frequencies are absent or filtered out from the input graph data. We then formulate a novel research problem of measuring and benchmarking the performance of GNNs from a spectral perspective. To take an initial step towards a comprehensive benchmark, we design an evaluation protocol supported by comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark on real-world datasets, revealing insights that challenge prevalent opinions from a spectral perspective. We believe that our findings will open new avenues for future advancements in this area. Our implementations can be found at: https://github.com/yushundong/Spectral-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Graphs that require distributed settings are often too large to fit in the main memory of a single machine. This challenge renders traditional in-memory graph partitioners infeasible, leading to the emergence of streaming solutions. Streaming partitioners produce lower-quality partitions because they work from partial information and must make premature decisions before they have a complete view of a vertex's neighborhood. We introduce CUTTANA, a streaming graph partitioner that partitions massive graphs (Web/Twitter scale) with superior quality compared to existing streaming solutions. CUTTANA uses a novel buffering technique that prevents the premature assignment of vertices to partitions and a scalable coarsening and refinement technique that enables a complete graph view, improving the intermediate assignment made by a streaming partitioner. We implemented a parallel version for CUTTANA that offers nearly the same partitioning latency as existing streaming partitioners. Our experimental analysis shows that CUTTANA consistently yields better partitioning quality than existing state-of-the-art streaming vertex partitioners in terms of both edge-cut and communication volume metrics. We also evaluate the workload latencies that result from using CUTTANA and other partitioners in distributed graph analytics and databases. CUTTANA outperforms the other methods in most scenarios (algorithms, datasets). In analytics applications, CUTTANA improves runtime performance by up to 59% compared to various streaming partitioners (HDRF, Fennel, Ginger, HeiStream). In graph database tasks, CUTTANA results in higher query throughput by up to 23%, without hurting tail latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VLDB 2025 (Vol.18, No.1).

These techniques, such as Incomplete Cholesky factorization (IC) and data-driven neural network methods, accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers like Conjugate Gradient (CG) by approximating the original matrices. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) with traditional IC, addressing the shortcomings of direct generation methods based on GNN and achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate an average reduction in iteration counts by 24.8% compared to IC and a two-order-of-magnitude increase in training scale compared to previous methods. A three-dimensional static structural analysis utilizing finite element methods was validated on training sparse matrices of up to 5 million dimensions and inference scales of up to 10 million. Furthermore, the approach demon-strates robust generalization capabilities across scales, facilitating the effective acceleration of CG solvers for large-scale linear equations using small-scale data on modest hardware. The method's robustness and scalability make it a practical solution for computational science.</p></details> |  |

However, MPNNs' generalization abilities -- making meaningful predictions beyond the training set -- remain less explored. Current generalization analyses often overlook graph structure, limit the focus to specific aggregation functions, and assume the impractical, hard-to-optimize $0$-$1$ loss function. Here, we extend recent advances in graph similarity theory to assess the influence of graph structure, aggregation, and loss functions on MPNNs' generalization abilities. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, improving our understanding of MPNNs' generalization properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-Enhanced Molecule Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01631v5)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning is vital for various downstream applications, including the analysis and prediction of molecular properties and side effects. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a popular framework for modeling molecular data, they often struggle to capture the full complexity of molecular representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called GODE, which accounts for the dual-level structure inherent in molecules. Molecules possess an intrinsic graph structure and simultaneously function as nodes within a broader molecular knowledge graph. GODE integrates individual molecular graph representations with multi-domain biochemical data from knowledge graphs. By pre-training two GNNs on different graph structures and employing contrastive learning, GODE effectively fuses molecular structures with their corresponding knowledge graph substructures. This fusion yields a more robust and informative representation, enhancing molecular property predictions by leveraging both chemical and biological information. When fine-tuned across 11 chemical property tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving an average ROC-AUC improvement of 12.7% for classification tasks and an average RMSE/MAE improvement of 34.4% for regression tasks. Notably, GODE surpasses the current leading model in property prediction, with advancements of 2.2% in classification and 7.2% in regression tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[MISFEAT: Feature Selection for Subgroups with Systematic Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06711v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of selecting features for datasets that can be naturally partitioned into subgroups (e.g., according to socio-demographic groups and age), each with its own dominant set of features. Within this subgroup-oriented framework, we address the challenge of systematic missing data, a scenario in which some feature values are missing for all tuples of a subgroup, due to flawed data integration, regulatory constraints, or privacy concerns. Feature selection is governed by finding mutual Information, a popular quantification of correlation, between features and a target variable. Our goal is to identify top-K feature subsets of some fixed size with the highest joint mutual information with a target variable. In the presence of systematic missing data, the closed form of mutual information could not simply be applied. We argue that in such a setting, leveraging relationships between available feature mutual information within a subgroup or across subgroups can assist inferring missing mutual information values. We propose a generalizable model based on heterogeneous graph neural network to identify interdependencies between feature-subgroup-target variable connections by modeling it as a multiplex graph, and employing information propagation between its nodes. We address two distinct scalability challenges related to training and propose principled solutions to tackle them. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions both qualitatively and running time wise.</p></details> |  |

GNNs have recently become a widely used graph analysis method due to their superior ability to learn representations for complex graph data. However, due to privacy concerns and regulation restrictions, centralized GNNs can be difficult to apply to data-sensitive scenarios. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technology developed for privacy-preserving settings when several parties need to train a shared global model collaboratively. Although several research works have applied FL to train GNNs (Federated GNNs), there is no research on their robustness to backdoor attacks. This paper bridges this gap by conducting two types of backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs: centralized backdoor attacks (CBA) and distributed backdoor attacks (DBA). Our experiments show that the DBA attack success rate is higher than CBA in almost all evaluated cases. For CBA, the attack success rate of all local triggers is similar to the global trigger even if the training set of the adversarial party is embedded with the global trigger. To further explore the properties of two backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs, we evaluate the attack performance for a different number of clients, trigger sizes, poisoning intensities, and trigger densities. Moreover, we explore the robustness of DBA and CBA against one defense. We find that both attacks are robust against the investigated defense, necessitating the need to consider backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs as a novel threat that requires custom defenses.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

Because graph data does not follow the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, adversarial manipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through message passing, which deteriorates the model's performance. To allow model developers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained GNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find that current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of manipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new graph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the manipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the performance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating retraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient. We hope our work assists GNN developers in mitigating harmful effects caused by issues in real-world data post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/varshitakolipaka/corrective-unlearning-for-gnns</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17365v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 22 figures.

| **[Automated Label Unification for Multi-Dataset Semantic Segmentation with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10534v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep supervised models possess significant capability to assimilate extensive training data, thereby presenting an opportunity to enhance model performance through training on multiple datasets. However, conflicts arising from different label spaces among datasets may adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically construct a unified label space across multiple datasets using graph neural networks. This enables semantic segmentation models to be trained simultaneously on multiple datasets, resulting in performance improvements. Unlike existing methods, our approach facilitates seamless training without the need for additional manual reannotation or taxonomy reconciliation. This significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-dataset segmentation model training. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other multi-dataset training methods when trained on seven datasets simultaneously, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildDash 2 benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We first propose a second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional ET. Utilizing this model, we derive novel closed-form Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the ET kinematic parameter estimation, such as the center range, azimuth angle, elevation angle, and orientation. Further, we formulate and solve two transmit beamforming design problems with optimization algorithms. The first one, named the CRB minimization problem, minimizes the CRB under constraints of communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, transmit power, and ET-specific beam coverage requirement, which is solved using the semidefinite relaxation technique. The second one, named the weighted-ISAC-metric problem, targets an weighted objective function combining the communication sum rate and sensing CRB, and is solved using the successive convex approximation technique. Additionally, by exploiting the penalty method, we introduce an unsupervised learning-based approach and propose a unique ISAC graph neural network (ISACGNN), composed of separate communication, sensing, and integration modules, to address both problems. Numerical results reveal the diverse CRB characteristics for different radar targets. The proposed beamforming designs are superior to existing baselines with better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and a more appropriate beampattern for sensing the 3D ET. Besides, our proposed ISACGNN can effectively mimic the dynamic structures of the SINR, sum rate, and CRB, demonstrating remarkable scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, partially published in IEEE Global Communications Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network(GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering(CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning(CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

The HGNN model integrates stock relationship data and hierarchical attributes to predict stock types effectively. The paper discusses the construction of a stock industry relationship graph and the extraction of temporal information from historical price sequences. It also highlights the design of a graph convolution operation and a temporal attention aggregator to model the macro market state. The integration of these features results in a comprehensive stock prediction model that addresses the challenges of utilizing stock relationship data and modeling hierarchical attributes in the stock market.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-guided Multimodal Approach to Enhancing Graph Representation Learning for Alzheimer's Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06212v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models designed to handle irregularly structured data. However, their generic design often proves inadequate for analyzing brain connectomes in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), highlighting the need to incorporate domain knowledge for optimal performance. Infusing AD-related knowledge into GNNs is a complicated task. Existing methods typically rely on collaboration between computer scientists and domain experts, which can be both time-intensive and resource-demanding. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel self-guided, knowledge-infused multimodal GNN that autonomously incorporates domain knowledge into the model development process. Our approach conceptualizes domain knowledge as natural language and introduces a specialized multimodal GNN capable of leveraging this uncurated knowledge to guide the learning process of the GNN, such that it can improve the model performance and strengthen the interpretability of the predictions. To evaluate our framework, we curated a comprehensive dataset of recent peer-reviewed papers on AD and integrated it with multiple real-world AD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to extract relevant domain knowledge, provide graph-based explanations for AD diagnosis, and improve the overall performance of the GNN. This approach provides a more scalable and efficient alternative to inject domain knowledge for AD compared with the manual design from the domain expert, advancing both prediction accuracy and interpretability in AD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

As a result, it becomes necessary to develop joint models that encompass both antennas and wireless propagation channels. To achieve this, we utilize the multi-port communication theory, which considers impedance matching among the source, transmission medium, and load to facilitate efficient power transfer. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of insertion loss, mutual coupling, and other factors on the performance of multi-port matching networks. Next, to further improve system performance, we explore two important deep unfolding designs for the multi-port matching networks: beamforming and power control, respectively. For the hybrid beamforming, we develop a deep unfolding framework, i.e., projected gradient descent (PGD)-Net based on unfolding projected gradient descent. For the power control, we design a deep unfolding network, graph neural network (GNN) aided alternating optimization (AO)Net, which considers the interaction between different ports in optimizing power allocation. Numerical results verify the necessity of considering insertion loss in the dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) performance analysis. Besides, the proposed PGD-Net based hybrid beamforming approaches approximate the conventional model-based algorithm with very low complexity. Moreover, our proposed power control scheme has a fast run time compared to the traditional weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Necessity of Graph Learning and Common Graph Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06173v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning has enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity since the introduction of deep learning in graph contexts. This is no surprise due to the ubiquity of graph data in large scale industrial settings. Tacitly assumed in all graph learning tasks is the separation of the graph structure and node features: node features strictly encode individual data while the graph structure consists only of pairwise interactions. The driving belief is that node features are (by themselves) insufficient for these tasks, so benchmark performance accurately reflects improvements in graph learning. In our paper, we challenge this orthodoxy by showing that, surprisingly, node features are oftentimes more-than-sufficient for many common graph benchmarks, breaking this critical assumption. When comparing against a well-tuned feature-only MLP baseline on seven of the most commonly used graph learning datasets, one gains little benefit from using graph structure on five datasets. We posit that these datasets do not benefit considerably from graph learning because the features themselves already contain enough graph information to obviate or substantially reduce the need for the graph. To illustrate this point, we perform a feature study on these datasets and show how the features are responsible for closing the gap between MLP and graph-method performance. Further, in service of introducing better empirical measures of progress for graph neural networks, we present a challenging parametric family of principled synthetic datasets that necessitate graph information for nontrivial performance. Lastly, we section out a subset of real-world datasets that are not trivially solved by an MLP and hence serve as reasonable benchmarks for graph neural networks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations.

Currently, GNNs in networked systems mostly follow a paradigm of `centralized training, distributed execution', which limits their adaptability and slows down their development cycles. In this work, we fill this gap for the first time by developing a communication-efficient, fully distributed online training approach for GNNs applied to large networked systems. For a mini-batch with $B$ samples, our approach of training an $L$-layer GNN only adds $L$ rounds of message passing to the $LB$ rounds required by GNN inference, with doubled message sizes. Through numerical experiments in graph-based node regression, power allocation, and link scheduling in wireless networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in training GNNs under supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Machine Learning (ML) has recently played a key role in advancing HT research. Various novel techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown HT insertion and detection capabilities. HT insertion with ML techniques, specifically, has seen a spike in research activity due to the shortcomings of conventional HT benchmarks and the inherent human design bias that occurs when we create them. This work continues this innovation by presenting a tool called TrojanForge, capable of generating HT adversarial examples that defeat HT detectors; demonstrating the capabilities of GAN-like adversarial tools for automatic HT insertion. We introduce an RL environment where the RL insertion agent interacts with HT detectors in an insertion-detection loop where the agent collects rewards based on its success in bypassing HT detectors. Our results show that this process helps inserted HTs evade various HT detectors, achieving high attack success percentages. This tool provides insight into why HT insertion fails in some instances and how we can leverage this knowledge in defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Machine Learning on Graphs with Nonlinear Spectral Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01249v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space. We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional MLP learning relies almost exclusively on graph nodes and fails to effectively capture the graph structural information. Previous methods address this issue by processing graph edges into extra inputs for MLPs, but such graph structures may be unavailable for various scenarios. To this end, we propose Prototype-Guided Knowledge Distillation (PGKD), which does not require graph edges (edge-free setting) yet learns structure-aware MLPs. Our insight is to distill graph structural information from GNNs. Specifically, we first employ the class prototypes to analyze the impact of graph structures on GNN teachers, and then design two losses to distill such information from GNNs to MLPs. Experimental results on popular graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGKD.</p></details> | COLING 2025 |

In this paper, we present an extensive empirical study to investigate the impact of graph reduction techniques, specifically graph coarsening and sparsification, on the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments involving multiple datasets and GNN architectures, we examine the effects of four sparsification and six coarsening methods on the poisoning attacks. Our results indicate that, while graph sparsification can mitigate the effectiveness of certain poisoning attacks, such as Mettack, it has limited impact on others, like PGD. Conversely, graph coarsening tends to amplify the adversarial impact, significantly reducing classification accuracy as the reduction ratio decreases. Additionally, we provide a novel analysis of the causes driving these effects and examine how defensive GNN models perform under graph reduction, offering practical insights for designing robust GNNs within graph acceleration systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Merging for Enhancing the Link Stealing Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05830v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically designed to process the graph data, have achieved remarkable success in various applications. Link stealing attacks on graph data pose a significant privacy threat, as attackers aim to extract sensitive relationships between nodes (entities), potentially leading to academic misconduct, fraudulent transactions, or other malicious activities. Previous studies have primarily focused on single datasets and did not explore cross-dataset attacks, let alone attacks that leverage the combined knowledge of multiple attackers. However, we find that an attacker can combine the data knowledge of multiple attackers to create a more effective attack model, which can be referred to cross-dataset attacks. Moreover, if knowledge can be extracted with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the attack capability will be more significant. In this paper, we propose a novel link stealing attack method that takes advantage of cross-dataset and Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM is applied to process datasets with different data structures in cross-dataset attacks. Each attacker fine-tunes the LLM on their specific dataset to generate a tailored attack model. We then introduce a novel model merging method to integrate the parameters of these attacker-specific models effectively. The result is a merged attack model with superior generalization capabilities, enabling effective attacks not only on the attackers' datasets but also on previously unseen (out-of-domain) datasets. We conducted extensive experiments in four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additional experiments with three different GNN and LLM architectures further illustrate the generality of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link Stealing Attacks, Large Language Models, Graph Neural Networks, Privacy Attacks, Model Merging</p></details> |

LLM-centered models often struggle to capture graph structures effectively, while GNN-centered models compress variable-length textual data into fixed-size vectors, limiting their ability to understand complex semantics. Additionally, GNN-centered approaches require converting tasks into a uniform, manually-designed format, restricting them to classification tasks and preventing language output. To address these limitations, we introduce a new architecture that deeply integrates GNN with LLM, featuring three key innovations: (1) Structure-Aware Transformers, which incorporate GNN's message-passing capabilities directly into LLM's transformer layers, allowing simultaneous processing of textual and structural information and generating outputs from both GNN and LLM; (2) Graph-Text Cross-Attention, which processes full, uncompressed text from graph nodes and edges, ensuring complete semantic integration; and (3) GNN-LLM Twin Predictor, enabling LLM's flexible autoregressive generation alongside GNN's scalable one-pass prediction. GL-Fusion achieves outstand performance on various tasks. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on OGBN-Arxiv and OGBG-Code2.</p></details> | under review |

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named BEV-SUSHI, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, BEV-SUSHI has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed BEV-SUSHI establishes the new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with 81.22 HOTA, and 95.6 IDF1 on the WildTrack dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the II edition of the Workshop on Unifying Representations in Neural Models (UniReps 2024)</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |

While traditional approaches like queuing theory and packet-level simulation have served as foundational tools, they face limitations in modeling complex traffic behaviors and scaling to large networks. This project presents an extended implementation of RouteNet-Fermi, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed for network performance prediction, with additional recurrent neural network variants. We improve the the original architecture by implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cells alongside the existing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells implementation. This work contributes to the understanding of recurrent neural architectures in GNN-based network modeling and provides a flexible framework for future experimentation with different cell types.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Precise sales forecasts for unreleased items could drastically improve the efficiency and profits of industries. However, predicting the success of entirely new styles is difficult due to the absence of past data and ever-changing trends. Specifically, currently used deterministic models struggle with domain shifts when encountering items outside their training data. The recently proposed diffusion models address this issue using a continuous-time diffusion process. Specifically, these models enable us to predict the sales of new items, mitigating the domain shift challenges encountered by deterministic models. As a result, this paper proposes Dif4FF, a novel two-stage pipeline for New Fashion Product Performance Forecasting (NFPPF) that leverages the power of diffusion models conditioned on multimodal data related to specific clothes. Dif4FF first utilizes a multimodal score-based diffusion model to forecast multiple sales trajectories for various garments over time. The forecasts are refined using a powerful Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture. By leveraging the GCN's capability to capture long-range dependencies within both the temporal and spatial data and seeking the optimal solution between these two dimensions, Dif4FF offers the most accurate and efficient forecasting system available in the literature for predicting the sales of new items. We tested Dif4FF on VISUELLE, the de facto standard for NFPPF, achieving new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)</p></details> |

Specifically, in the industrial GUI-to-code process, fragmented layers may decrease the readability and maintainability of generated code, which can be alleviated by grouping semantically consistent fragmented layers in the design prototypes. This study aims to propose a graph-learning-based approach to tackle the fragmented layer grouping problem according to multi-modal information in design prototypes. Our graph learning module consists of self-attention and graph neural network modules. By taking the multimodal fused representation of GUI layers as input, we innovatively group fragmented layers by classifying GUI layers and regressing the bounding boxes of the corresponding GUI components simultaneously. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. A further user study is also conducted to validate that our approach can assist an intelligent downstream tool in generating more maintainable and readable front-end code.</p></details> | 28 pages,6 figures |
| **[Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt Learning for Urban Flow Prediction under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05534v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban flow prediction is a classic spatial-temporal forecasting task that estimates the amount of future traffic flow for a given location. Though models represented by Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have established themselves as capable predictors, they tend to suffer from distribution shifts that are common with the urban flow data due to the dynamics and unpredictability of spatial-temporal events. Unfortunately, in spatial-temporal applications, the dynamic environments can hardly be quantified via a fixed number of parameters, whereas learning time- and location-specific environments can quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt learning (MIP) for urban flow prediction under constant distribution shifts. Specifically, MIP is equipped with a learnable memory bank that is trained to memorize the causal features within the spatial-temporal graph. By querying a trainable memory bank that stores the causal features, we adaptively extract invariant and variant prompts (i.e., patterns) for a given location at every time step. Then, instead of intervening the raw data based on simulated environments, we directly perform intervention on variant prompts across space and time. With the intervened variant prompts in place, we use invariant learning to minimize the variance of predictions, so as to ensure that the predictions are only made with invariant features. With extensive comparative experiments on two public urban flow datasets, we thoroughly demonstrate the robustness of MIP against OOD data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Homophilic Graph Pre-Training and Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12594v4)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex relationships between objects across various fields. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We delineate a novel State Augmentation (SA) strategy to maximize the aggregate information at source nodes using graph neural network (GNN) architectures, by deploying graph convolutions over the topological links of the communication network. The proposed technique leverages only the local information available at each node and efficiently routes desired information to the destination nodes. We leverage an unsupervised learning procedure to convert the output of the GNN architecture to optimal information routing strategies. In the experiments, we perform the evaluation on real-time network topologies to validate our algorithms. Numerical simulations depict the improved performance of the proposed method in training a GNN parameterization as compared to baseline algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The Intelligible and Effective Graph Neural Additive Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01317v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[An end-to-end attention-based approach for learning on graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10793v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent surge in transformer-based architectures for learning on graphs, mainly motivated by attention as an effective learning mechanism and the desire to supersede handcrafted operators characteristic of message passing schemes. However, concerns over their empirical effectiveness, scalability, and complexity of the pre-processing steps have been raised, especially in relation to much simpler graph neural networks that typically perform on par with them across a wide range of benchmarks. To tackle these shortcomings, we consider graphs as sets of edges and propose a purely attention-based approach consisting of an encoder and an attention pooling mechanism. The encoder vertically interleaves masked and vanilla self-attention modules to learn an effective representations of edges, while allowing for tackling possible misspecifications in input graphs. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms fine-tuned message passing baselines and recently proposed transformer-based methods on more than 70 node and graph-level tasks, including challenging long-range benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different tasks, ranging from molecular to vision graphs, and heterophilous node classification. The approach also outperforms graph neural networks and transformers in transfer learning settings, and scales much better than alternatives with a similar performance level or expressive power.</p></details> |  |

They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural network-based entity alignment methods have achieved promising results in Euclidean space. However, KGs often contain complex structures, including both local and hierarchical ones, which make it challenging to efficiently represent them within a single space. In this paper, we proposed a novel method UniEA, which unifies dual-space embedding to preserve the intrinsic structure of KGs. Specifically, we learn graph structure embedding in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces simultaneously to maximize the consistency between the embedding in both spaces. Moreover, we employ contrastive learning to mitigate the misalignment issues caused by similar entities, where embedding of similar neighboring entities within the KG become too close in distance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in structure-based EA.

We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities.

Due to both hardware advancements and limitations in current software stacks, the need for data efficiency has risen. Data efficiency refers to the effective hiding of data access latency and the avoidance of unnecessary data movements. Major challenges arise from the growing disparity between GPU memory bandwidth and computational throughput, imminent GPU memory capacity limitations, and inefficiencies in the PyTorch software stack, including a lack of device-specific PCIe transfer optimizations and high-level domain-specific abstractions. To effectively mitigate these data inefficiencies for deep learning training, this dissertation analyzes data inefficiency in representative deep training tasks, specifically in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). It then proposes novel runtime and code generation techniques to mitigate these challenges and implements these optimizations seamlessly within the PyTorch stack while maintaining strong programmability and interoperability. First, PyTorch-Direct is devised to incorporate the GPU-centric PCIe data transfer paradigm in PyTorch for GNN training. Next, Hector intermediate representation (IR) and its code generator are proposed to introduce domain-specific high-level abstraction and systematically address memory-intensive performance challenges for relational GNNs. Finally, in LLM training, the throughput has been increasingly constrained by GPU memory capacity. To mitigate this, the SSDTrain offloading framework is designed and implemented. Together, these contributions show that code generation and runtime techniques can systematically mitigate the data management bottlenecks in deep learning training, which stem from the data-intensive nature of workloads and the oversimplification inherent in the deep learning training software stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ph.D....</summary><p>Ph.D. Thesis, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2024</p></details> |

To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

However, due to many state-of-the-art approaches relying on uninterpretable black-box models, there is growing demand for methods that offer stakeholders clear and actionable insights into their latent beliefs and motivations. To address this, we evaluate Theory of Mind (ToM) approaches for Autonomous Cyber Operations. Upon learning a robust prior, ToM models can predict an agent's goals, behaviours, and contextual beliefs given only a handful of past behaviour observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based ToM architecture tailored for cyber-defence, Graph-In, Graph-Out (GIGO)-ToM, which can accurately predict both the targets and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents over arbitrary computer network topologies. To evaluate the latter, we propose a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance for measuring the similarity of graph-based probability distributions. Whereas the standard Wasserstein distance lacks a fixed reference scale, we introduce a graph-theoretic normalization factor that enables a standardized comparison between networks of different sizes. We furnish this metric, which we term the Network Transport Distance (NTD), with a weighting function that emphasizes predictions according to custom node features, allowing network operators to explore arbitrary strategic considerations. Benchmarked against a Graph-In, Dense-Out (GIDO)-ToM architecture in an abstract cyber-defence environment, our empirical evaluations show that GIGO-ToM can accurately predict the goals and behaviours of various unseen cyber-attacking agents across a range of network topologies, as well as learn embeddings that can effectively characterize their policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 17 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01910v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo & al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel method that integrates both approaches for enhanced performance. Our framework uses Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based and sequential recommenders as separate submodules while sharing a unified embedding space optimized jointly. To enable positive knowledge transfer, we design a loss function that enforces alignment and uniformity both within and across submodules.

Despite their successful and diverse applications, oversmoothing prohibits deep architectures due to node features converging to a single fixed point. This severely limits their potential to solve complex tasks. To counteract this tendency, we propose a plug-and-play module consisting of three steps: Cluster-Normalize-Activate (CNA). By applying CNA modules, GNNs search and form super nodes in each layer, which are normalized and activated individually. We demonstrate in node classification and property prediction tasks that CNA significantly improves the accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Particularly, CNA reaches 94.18% and 95.75% accuracy on Cora and CiteSeer, respectively. It further benefits GNNs in regression tasks as well, reducing the mean squared error compared to all baselines. At the same time, GNNs with CNA require substantially fewer learnable parameters than competing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Disentangle Causal Model: Enhancing Causal Inference in Networked Observational Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03913v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) from observational data is a critical task across various domains. However, many existing works on ITE estimation overlook the influence of hidden confounders, which remain unobserved at the individual unit level. To address this limitation, researchers have utilized graph neural networks to aggregate neighbors' features to capture the hidden confounders and mitigate confounding bias by minimizing the discrepancy of confounder representations between the treated and control groups. Despite the success of these approaches, practical scenarios often treat all features as confounders and involve substantial differences in feature distributions between the treated and control groups. Confusing the adjustment and confounder and enforcing strict balance on the confounder representations could potentially undermine the effectiveness of outcome prediction. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework called the \textit{Graph Disentangle Causal model} (GDC) to conduct ITE estimation in the network setting. GDC utilizes a causal disentangle module to separate unit features into adjustment and confounder representations. Then we design a graph aggregation module consisting of three distinct graph aggregators to obtain adjustment, confounder, and counterfactual confounder representations. Finally, a causal constraint module is employed to enforce the disentangled representations as true causal factors. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by conducting comprehensive experiments on two networked datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03864v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

| **[Online Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13966v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation, a technique recently gaining popularity for enhancing model generalization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), operates under the assumption that both teacher and student models are trained on identical data distributions. However, its effect on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is less than satisfactory since the graph topology and node attributes are prone to evolve, thereby leading to the issue of distribution shift. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by simultaneously training a group of graph neural networks in an online distillation fashion, where the group knowledge plays a role as a dynamic virtual teacher and the structure changes in graph neural networks are effectively captured. To improve the distillation performance, two types of knowledge are transferred among the students to enhance each other: local knowledge reflecting information in the graph topology and node attributes, and global knowledge reflecting the prediction over classes. We transfer the global knowledge with KL-divergence as the vanilla knowledge distillation does, while exploiting the complicated structure of the local knowledge with an efficient adversarial cyclic learning framework. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our proposed online adversarial distillation approach. The code is published at https://github.com/wangz3066/OnlineDistillGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)</p></details> |
| **[Expressivity of Representation Learning on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs: An Information-Flow Centric Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03783v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, ranging from social networks to biological systems, and have inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive representations. While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>12-pa...</summary><p>12-page main paper + 8-page appendix</p></details> |

However, existing datasets primarily focus on detecting severe crimes by analyzing entire video clips, often neglecting the precursor activities (i.e., privacy violations) that could potentially prevent these crimes. To address this limitation, we present PV-VTT (Privacy Violation Video To Text), a unique multimodal dataset aimed at identifying privacy violations. PV-VTT provides detailed annotations for both video and text in scenarios. To ensure the privacy of individuals in the videos, we only provide video feature vectors, avoiding the release of any raw video data. This privacy-focused approach allows researchers to use the dataset while protecting participant confidentiality. Recognizing that privacy violations are often ambiguous and context-dependent, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based video description model. Our model generates a GNN-based prompt with image for Large Language Model (LLM), which deliver cost-effective and high-quality video descriptions. By leveraging a single video frame along with relevant text, our method reduces the number of input tokens required, maintaining descriptive quality while optimizing LLM API-usage. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach in video description tasks and flexibility of our PV-VTT dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025, Dataset Available Here : https://ryozomasukawa.github.io/PV-VTT.github.io/</p></details> |

My dissertation focuses on developing intrinsically interpretable models when using LMs as encoders while maintaining their superior performance via prototypical networks. I initiated my research by investigating enhancements in performance for interpretable models of sarcasm detection. My proposed approach focuses on capturing sentiment incongruity to enhance accuracy while offering instance-based explanations for the classification decisions. Later, I developed a novel white-box multi-head graph attention-based prototype network designed to explain the decisions of text classification models without sacrificing the accuracy of the original black-box LMs. In addition, I am working on extending the attention-based prototype network with contrastive learning to redesign an interpretable graph neural network, aiming to enhance both the interpretability and performance of the model in document classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, accepted by AAAI25 DC</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Malware Detection through Integrated Graph Reduction and Learning Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03634v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control Flow Graphs and Function Call Graphs have become pivotal in providing a detailed understanding of program execution and effectively characterizing the behavior of malware. These graph-based representations, when combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), have shown promise in developing high-performance malware detectors. However, challenges remain due to the large size of these graphs and the inherent opacity in the decision-making process of GNNs. This paper addresses these issues by developing several graph reduction techniques to reduce graph size and applying the state-of-the-art GNNExplainer to enhance the interpretability of GNN outputs. The analysis demonstrates that integrating our proposed graph reduction technique along with GNNExplainer in the malware detection framework significantly reduces graph size while preserving high performance, providing an effective balance between efficiency and transparency in malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Data Integration for Bike-sharing Demand Prediction with Graph Neural Networks in Degraded Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03307v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand for bike sharing is impacted by various factors, such as weather conditions, events, and the availability of other transportation modes. This impact remains elusive due to the complex interdependence of these factors or locationrelated user behavior variations. It is also not clear which factor is additional information which are not already contained in the historical demand. Intermodal dependencies between bike-sharing and other modes are also underexplored, and the value of this information has not been studied in degraded situations. The proposed study analyzes the impact of adding contextual data, such as weather, time embedding, and road traffic flow, to predict bike-sharing Origin-Destination (OD) flows in atypical weather situations Our study highlights a mild relationship between prediction quality of bike-sharing demand and road traffic flow, while the introduced time embedding allows outperforming state-of-the-art results, particularly in the case of degraded weather conditions. Including weather data as an additional input further improves our model with respect to the basic ST-ED-RMGC prediction model by reducing of more than 20% the prediction error in degraded weather condition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Node Classification With Integrated Reject Option](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03190v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key tasks in graph learning is node classification. While Graph neural networks have been used for various applications, their adaptivity to reject option setting is not previously explored. In this paper, we propose NCwR, a novel approach to node classification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with an integrated reject option, which allows the model to abstain from making predictions when uncertainty is high. We propose both cost-based and coverage-based methods for classification with abstention in node classification setting using GNNs. We perform experiments using our method on three standard citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed and compare with relevant baselines. We also model the Legal judgment prediction problem on ILDC dataset as a node classification problem where nodes represent legal cases and edges represent citations. We further interpret the model by analyzing the cases that the model abstains from predicting by visualizing which part of the input features influenced this decision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
