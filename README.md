| **[Sensor-Aware Classifiers for Energy-Efficient Time Series Applications on IoT Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08715v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data processing is an important component of many real-world applications, such as health monitoring, environmental monitoring, and digital agriculture. These applications collect distinct windows of sensor data (e.g., few seconds) and process them to assess the environment. Machine learning (ML) models are being employed in time-series applications due to their generalization abilities for classification. State-of-the-art time-series applications wait for entire sensor data window to become available before processing the data using ML algorithms, resulting in high sensor energy consumption. However, not all situations require processing full sensor window to make accurate inference. For instance, in activity recognition, sitting and standing activities can be inferred with partial windows. Using this insight, we propose to employ early exit classifiers with partial sensor windows to minimize energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we first utilize multiple early exits with successively increasing amount of data as they become available in a window. If early exits provide inference with high confidence, we return the label and enter low power mode for sensors. The proposed approach has potential to enable significant energy savings in time series applications. We utilize neural networks and random forest classifiers to evaluate our approach. Our evaluations with six datasets show that the proposed approach enables up to 50-60% energy savings on average without any impact on accuracy. The energy savings can enable time-series applications in remote locations with limited energy availability.</p></details> |  |

FAR solutions analyse and learn from multiple data sources, including time series pricing data, customer profile information and expectations, as well as past investments. However, most models have been developed over proprietary datasets, making a comparison over a common benchmark impossible. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem by introducing FAR-Trans, the first public dataset for FAR, containing pricing information and retail investor transactions acquired from a large European financial institution. We also provide a bench-marking comparison between eleven FAR algorithms over the data for use as future baselines. The dataset can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.1658 .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IJCAI-2024 Workshop on Recommender Systems in Finance (Fin-RecSys)</p></details> |
| **[Large Pre-trained time series models for cross-domain Time series analysis tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11413v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained models have been vital in recent advancements in domains like language and vision, making model training for individual downstream tasks more efficient and provide superior performance. However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a foundational time-series model from multi-domain time-series datasets: extracting semantically useful tokenized inputs to the model across heterogenous time-series from different domains. We propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) that introduces a novel method of \textit{adaptive segmentation} that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy during pre-training. This enables LPTM to perform similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model when fine-tuned to different downstream time-series analysis tasks and under zero-shot settings. LPTM achieves superior forecasting and time-series classification results taking up to 40% less data and 50% less training time compared to state-of-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Toto: Time Series Optimized Transformer for Observability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07874v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This technical report describes the Time Series Optimized Transformer for Observability (Toto), a new state of the art foundation model for time series forecasting developed by Datadog. In addition to advancing the state of the art on generalized time series benchmarks in domains such as electricity and weather, this model is the first general-purpose time series forecasting foundation model to be specifically tuned for observability metrics. Toto was trained on a dataset of one trillion time series data points, the largest among all currently published time series foundation models. Alongside publicly available time series datasets, 75% of the data used to train Toto consists of fully anonymous numerical metric data points from the Datadog platform. In our experiments, Toto outperforms existing time series foundation models on observability data. It does this while also excelling at general-purpose forecasting tasks, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple open benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information matrix test for normality of innovations in stationary time series models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08565v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study focuses on the problem of testing for normality of innovations in stationary time series models.To achieve this, we introduce an information matrix (IM) based test. While the IM test was originally developed to test for model misspecification, our study addresses that the test can also be used to test for the normality of innovations in various time series models. We provide sufficient conditions under which the limiting null distribution of the test statistics exists. As applications, a first-order threshold moving average model, GARCH model and double autoregressive model are considered. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed test and compare with other tests, and provide a real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paving the way toward foundation models for irregular and unaligned Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08448v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses.As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Deep is your Guess? A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel classification framework for time-series imputation using deep learning, with a particular focus on clinical data. By identifying conceptual gaps in the literature and existing reviews, we devise a taxonomy grounded on the inductive bias of neural imputation frameworks, resulting in a classification of existing deep imputation strategies based on their suitability for specific imputation scenarios and data-specific properties. Our review further examines the existing methodologies employed to benchmark deep imputation models, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing the missingness scenarios found in clinical data and emphasising the importance of reconciling mathematical abstraction with clinical insights. Our classification aims to serve as a guide for researchers to facilitate the selection of appropriate deep learning imputation techniques tailored to their specific clinical data. Our novel perspective also highlights the significance of bridging the gap between computational methodologies and medical insights to achieve clinically sound imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Centre-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection using Masked Latent Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12550v4)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel time series anomaly detection method that achieves excellent detection accuracy while offering a superior level of explainability. Our proposed method, TimeVQVAE-AD, leverages masked generative modeling adapted from the cutting-edge time series generation method known as TimeVQVAE. The prior model is trained on the discrete latent space of a time-frequency domain. Notably, the dimensional semantics of the time-frequency domain are preserved in the latent space, enabling us to compute anomaly scores across different frequency bands, which provides a better insight into the detected anomalies. Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of the detected anomalies through counterfactuals. Our experimental evaluation on the UCR Time Series Anomaly archive demonstrates that TimeVQVAE-AD significantly surpasses the existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability. We provide our implementation on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/ML4ITS/TimeVQVAE-AnomalyDetection}.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptively Weighted Averaging Method for Regional Time Series Extraction of fMRI-based Brain Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08174v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain decoding that classifies cognitive states using the functional fluctuations of the brain can provide insightful information for understanding the brain mechanisms of cognitive functions. Among the common procedures of decoding the brain cognitive states with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), extracting the time series of each brain region after brain parcellation traditionally averages across the voxels within a brain region. This neglects the spatial information among the voxels and the requirement of extracting information for the downstream tasks. In this study, we propose to use a fully connected neural network that is jointly trained with the brain decoder to perform an adaptively weighted average across the voxels within each brain region. We perform extensive evaluations by cognitive state decoding, manifold learning, and interpretability analysis on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The performance comparison of the cognitive state decoding presents an accuracy increase of up to 5\% and stable accuracy improvement under different time window sizes, resampling sizes, and training data sizes. The results of manifold learning show that our method presents a considerable separability among cognitive states and basically excludes subject-specific information. The interpretability analysis shows that our method can identify reasonable brain regions corresponding to each cognitive state. Our study would aid the improvement of the basic pipeline of fMRI processing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Synthetic Electroretinogram Signal Generation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Enhancing Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08166v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electroretinogram (ERG) is a clinical test that records the retina's electrical response to light. The ERG is a promising way to study different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language, communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated. Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer and Visual Transformer with Continuous Wavelet Transform to enhance classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the ERG may help classify disorders.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoMate: Specialist and Generalist Assembly Policies over Diverse Geometries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08028v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic assembly for high-mixture settings requires adaptivity to diverse parts and poses, which is an open challenge. Meanwhile, in other areas of robotics, large models and sim-to-real have led to tremendous progress. Inspired by such work, we present AutoMate, a learning framework and system that consists of 4 parts: 1) a dataset of 100 assemblies compatible with simulation and the real world, along with parallelized simulation environments for policy learning, 2) a novel simulation-based approach for learning specialist (i.e., part-specific) policies and generalist (i.e., unified) assembly policies, 3) demonstrations of specialist policies that individually solve 80 assemblies with 80% or higher success rates in simulation, as well as a generalist policy that jointly solves 20 assemblies with an 80%+ success rate, and 4) zero-shot sim-to-real transfer that achieves similar (or better) performance than simulation, including on perception-initialized assembly. The key methodological takeaway is that a union of diverse algorithms from manufacturing engineering, character animation, and time-series analysis provides a generic and robust solution for a diverse range of robotic assembly problems.To our knowledge, AutoMate provides the first simulation-based framework for learning specialist and generalist policies over a wide range of assemblies, as well as the first system demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer over such a range.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Self-organizing Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network for Multi-Step Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08010v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new self-organizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO) for multi-step time series prediction. Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network is developed to improve prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step predictions. Second, a new transformation layer is designed to address the potential issues in the vanished rule firing strength caused by highdimensional inputs. Third, a new link layer is proposed to build temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Furthermore, a two-stage self-organizing mechanism is developed to automatically generate the fuzzy rules, in which the first stage is used to create the rule base from empty and perform the initial optimization, while the second stage is to fine-tune all network parameters. Finally, various simulations are carried out on chaotic and microgrid time series prediction problems, demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradual changes in functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07996v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of detecting gradual changes in the sequence of mean functions from a not necessarily stationary functional time series. Our approach is based on the maximum deviation (calculated over a given time interval) between a benchmark function and the mean functions at different time points. We speak of a gradual change of size $\Delta $, if this quantity exceeds a given threshold $\Delta>0$. For example, the benchmark function could represent an average of yearly temperature curves from the pre-industrial time, and we are interested in the question if the yearly temperature curves afterwards deviate from the pre-industrial average by more than $\Delta =1.5$ degrees Celsius, where the deviations are measured with respect to the sup-norm. Using Gaussian approximations for high-dimensional data we develop a test for hypotheses of this type and estimators for the time where a deviation of size larger than $\Delta$ appears for the first time. We prove the validity of our approach and illustrate the new methods by a simulation study and a data example, where we analyze yearly temperature curves at different stations in Australia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Weak Label Generation for Data Programming with Clinicians in the Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07982v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often data hungry and need high-quality labeled data in copious amounts for learning to converge. This is a challenge in the field of medicine since high quality labeled data is often scarce. Data programming has been the ray of hope in this regard, since it allows us to label unlabeled data using multiple weak labeling functions. Such functions are often supplied by a domain expert. Data-programming can combine multiple weak labeling functions and suggest labels better than simple majority voting over the different functions. However, it is not straightforward to express such weak labeling functions, especially in high-dimensional settings such as images and time-series data. What we propose in this paper is a way to bypass this issue, using distance functions. In high-dimensional spaces, it is easier to find meaningful distance metrics which can generalize across different labeling tasks. We propose an algorithm that queries an expert for labels of a few representative samples of the dataset. These samples are carefully chosen by the algorithm to capture the distribution of the dataset. The labels assigned by the expert on the representative subset induce a labeling on the full dataset, thereby generating weak labels to be used in the data programming pipeline. In our medical time series case study, labeling a subset of 50 to 130 out of 3,265 samples showed 17-28% improvement in accuracy and 13-28% improvement in F1 over the baseline using clinician-defined labeling functions. In our medical image case study, labeling a subset of about 50 to 120 images from 6,293 unlabeled medical images using our approach showed significant improvement over the baseline method, Snuba, with an increase of approximately 5-15% in accuracy and 12-19% in F1 score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced-Rank Matrix Autoregressive Models: A Medium $N$ Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07973v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-rank regressions are powerful tools used to identify co-movements within economic time series. However, this task becomes challenging when we observe matrix-valued time series, where each dimension may have a different co-movement structure. We propose reduced-rank regressions with a tensor structure for the coefficient matrix to provide new insights into co-movements within and between the dimensions of matrix-valued time series. Moreover, we relate the co-movement structures to two commonly used reduced-rank models, namely the serial correlation common feature and the index model. Two empirical applications involving U.S.\ states and economic indicators for the Eurozone and North American countries illustrate how our new tools identify co-movements.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |
| **[NuTime: Numerically Multi-Scaled Embedding for Large-Scale Time-Series Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07402v3)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on time-series self-supervised models shows great promise in learning semantic representations. However, it has been limited to small-scale datasets, e.g., thousands of temporal sequences. In this work, we make key technical contributions that are tailored to the numerical properties of time-series data and allow the model to scale to large datasets, e.g., millions of temporal sequences. We adopt the Transformer architecture by first partitioning the input into non-overlapping windows. Each window is then characterized by its normalized shape and two scalar values denoting the mean and standard deviation within each window. To embed scalar values that may possess arbitrary numerical amplitudes in a high-dimensional space, we propose a numerically multi-scaled embedding module enumerating all possible numerical scales for the scalars. The model undergoes pretraining with a simple contrastive objective on a large-scale dataset over a million sequences collected by merging existing public data. We study its transfer performance on a number of univariate and multivariate classification tasks, few shot learning, unsupervised clustering and anomaly detection benchmarks. Our method exhibits remarkable improvement against previous pretraining approaches and establishes the new state of the art, even compared with domain-specific non-learning-based methods. Code is available at: \url{https://github.com/chenguolin/NuTime}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Testing for sparse idiosyncratic components in factor-augmented regression models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13364v4)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel bootstrap test of a dense model, namely factor regression, against a sparse plus dense alternative augmenting model with sparse idiosyncratic components. The asymptotic properties of the test are established under time series dependence and polynomial tails. We outline a data-driven rule to select the tuning parameter and prove its theoretical validity. In simulation experiments, our procedure exhibits high power against sparse alternatives and low power against dense deviations from the null. Moreover, we apply our test to various datasets in macroeconomics and finance and often reject the null. This suggests the presence of sparsity -- on top of a dense model -- in commonly studied economic applications. The R package FAS implements our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian changepoint detection via logistic regression and the topological analysis of image series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02917v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Bayesian method for multivariate changepoint detection that allows for simultaneous inference on the location of a changepoint and the coefficients of a logistic regression model for distinguishing pre-changepoint data from post-changepoint data. In contrast to many methods for multivariate changepoint detection, the proposed method is applicable to data of mixed type and avoids strict assumptions regarding the distribution of the data and the nature of the change. The regression coefficients provide an interpretable description of a potentially complex change. For posterior inference, the model admits a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm based on P\'olya-gamma data augmentation. We establish conditions under which the proposed method is guaranteed to recover the true underlying changepoint. As a testing ground for our method, we consider the problem of detecting topological changes in time series of images. We demonstrate that our proposed method $\mathtt{bclr}$, combined with a topological feature embedding, performs well on both simulated and real image data. The method also successfully recovers the location and nature of changes in more traditional changepoint tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages (main), 18 pages (supplementary), 12 figures, and 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07655v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph signal processing (GSP) facilitates the analysis of high-dimensional data on non-Euclidean domains by utilizing graph signals defined on graph vertices. In addition to static data, each vertex can provide continuous time-series signals, transforming graph signals into time-series signals on each vertex. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) framework offers spectral analysis capabilities to analyze these joint time-vertex signals. Analogous to the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) extending the ordinary Fourier transform (FT), we introduce the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRT) as a generalization of JFT. The JFRT enables fractional analysis for joint time-vertex processing by extending Fourier analysis to fractional orders in both temporal and vertex domains. We theoretically demonstrate that JFRT generalizes JFT and maintains properties such as index additivity, reversibility, reduction to identity, and unitarity for specific graph topologies. Additionally, we derive Tikhonov regularization-based denoising in the JFRT domain, ensuring robust and well-behaved solutions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of JFRT in denoising and clustering tasks that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Satellite Image Time Series Semantic Change Detection: Novel Architecture and Analysis of Domain Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07616v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in monitoring changes happening on Earth's surface and aiding in climate analysis, ecosystem assessment, and disaster response. In this paper, we tackle semantic change detection with satellite image time series (SITS-SCD) which encompasses both change detection and semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a new architecture that improves over the state of the art, scales better with the number of parameters, and leverages long-term temporal information. However, for practical use cases, models need to adapt to spatial and temporal shifts, which remains a challenge. We investigate the impact of temporal and spatial shifts separately on global, multi-year SITS datasets using DynamicEarthNet and MUDS. We show that the spatial domain shift represents the most complex setting and that the impact of temporal shift on performance is more pronounced on change detection than on semantic segmentation, highlighting that it is a specific issue deserving further attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Inverse Conditional Flows Can Serve as a Substitute for Distributional Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05429v3)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression, are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at UAI 2024 https://www.auai.org/uai2024/accepted_papers</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Bayesian State Estimation with Compressed Measurement of Model-free Process using Semi-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The research topic is: data-driven Bayesian state estimation with compressed measurement (BSCM) of model-free process, say for a (causal) tracking application. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than the dimension of the temporal state vector to be estimated. Hence the state estimation problem is an underdetermined inverse problem. The state-space-model (SSM) of the underlying dynamical process is assumed to be unknown and hence, we use the terminology 'model-free process'. In absence of the SSM, we can not employ traditional model-driven methods like Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF) and instead require data-driven methods. We first experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem for model-free process; they are data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method and deep Markov model (DMM) method. The unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data comprised of only noisy measurements. While DANSE provides a good predictive performance to model the temporal measurement data as time-series, its unsupervised learning lacks a regularization for state estimation. We then investigate use of a semi-supervised learning approach, and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In the semi-supervised learning, we use a limited amount of labelled data along-with a large amount of unlabelled data, and that helps to bring the desired regularization for BSCM problem in the absence of SSM. The labelled data means pairwise measurement-and-state data. Using three chaotic dynamical systems (or processes) with nonlinear SSMs as benchmark, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive performance for BSCM against three SSM-informed methods - a hybrid method called KalmanNet, and two traditional model-driven methods called extended KF and unscented KF.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, under review at IEEE TSP.

| **[ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field. The code for our framework is accessible at https://github.com/IkeYang/ViTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Discovery in Semi-Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07291v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relations from observational time series without making the stationary assumption is a significant challenge. In practice, this challenge is common in many areas, such as retail sales, transportation systems, and medical science. Here, we consider this problem for a class of non-stationary time series. The structural causal model (SCM) of this type of time series, called the semi-stationary time series, exhibits that a finite number of different causal mechanisms occur sequentially and periodically across time. This model holds considerable practical utility because it can represent periodicity, including common occurrences such as seasonality and diurnal variation. We propose a constraint-based, non-parametric algorithm for discovering causal relations in this setting. The resulting algorithm, PCMCI$_{\Omega}$, can capture the alternating and recurring changes in the causal mechanisms and then identify the underlying causal graph with conditional independence (CI) tests. We show that this algorithm is sound in identifying causal relations on discrete time series. We validate the algorithm with extensive experiments on continuous and discrete simulated data.

It is widely applied in many areas, such as human-activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of high-dimensional data: If any one variable changes, the whole time series is assumed to have changed. However, in practical applications, we may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their distributions in the presence of other time series. Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation, we address this problem by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods. The algorithm then uses conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution disparity between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery method enables a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This real-world data is complex in many ways and requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Studies in Computational Intelligence Journal. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.02253</p></details> |
| **[Factor modelling for high-dimensional functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13651v3)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many economic and scientific problems involve the analysis of high-dimensional functional time series, where the number of functional variables $p$ diverges as the number of serially dependent observations $n$ increases. In this paper, we present a novel functional factor model for high-dimensional functional time series that maintains and makes use of the functional and dynamic structure to achieve great dimension reduction and find the latent factor structure. To estimate the number of functional factors and the factor loadings, we propose a fully functional estimation procedure based on an eigenanalysis for a nonnegative definite and symmetric matrix. Our proposal involves a weight matrix to improve the estimation efficiency and tackle the issue of heterogeneity, the rationale of which is illustrated by formulating the estimation from a novel regression perspective. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are studied when $p$ diverges at some polynomial rate as $n$ increases. To provide a parsimonious model and enhance interpretability for near-zero factor loadings, we impose sparsity assumptions on the factor loading space and then develop a regularized estimation procedure with theoretical guarantees when $p$ grows exponentially fast relative to $n.$ Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed estimators significantly outperform the competing methods through both simulations and applications to a U.K. temperature data set and a Japanese mortality data set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Convolution Derived Multi-Layered Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06771v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of time series is a challenging task relevant in such diverse applications as analyzing financial data, forecasting flow dynamics or understanding biological processes. Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

A wide variety of statistical techniques have been proposed in the literature; however, many such methods are limited in the forms of dependence they can capture, or make strong parametric assumptions about data structures. In this article, we introduce a novel inference framework for multivariate extremes based on a semi-parametric angular-radial model. This model overcomes the limitations of many existing approaches and provides a unified paradigm for assessing joint tail behaviour. Alongside inferential tools, we also introduce techniques for assessing uncertainty and goodness of fit. Our proposed technique is tested on simulated data sets alongside observed metocean time series', with results indicating generally good performance.</p></details> | Up-to-date draft |
| **[TSGM: A Flexible Framework for Generative Modeling of Synthetic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11567v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally indexed data are essential in a wide range of fields and of interest to machine learning researchers. Time series data, however, are often scarce or highly sensitive, which precludes the sharing of data between researchers and industrial organizations and the application of existing and new data-intensive ML methods. A possible solution to this bottleneck is to generate synthetic data. In this work, we introduce Time Series Generative Modeling (TSGM), an open-source framework for the generative modeling of synthetic time series. TSGM includes a broad repertoire of machine learning methods: generative models, probabilistic, and simulator-based approaches. The framework enables users to evaluate the quality of the produced data from different angles: similarity, downstream effectiveness, predictive consistency, diversity, and privacy. The framework is extensible, which allows researchers to rapidly implement their own methods and compare them in a shareable environment. TSGM was tested on open datasets and in production and proved to be beneficial in both cases. Additionally to the library, the project allows users to employ command line interfaces for synthetic data generation which lowers the entry threshold for those without a programming background.</p></details> |  |

In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

JANET generalises the inductive conformal framework and efficiently produces joint prediction regions with controlled K-familywise error rates, enabling flexible adaptation to specific application needs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates JANET's superior performance in multi-step prediction tasks across diverse time series datasets, highlighting its potential for reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification in sequential data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Alter...</summary><p>Alternate Title: Conformalised Joint Prediction Region for Time Series</p></details> |

Our system includes a novel partial weight loading mechanism based on sub-graph isomorphism which allows for continually training and modifying a network over many training cycles.

We provide a detailed description of the dataset along with a statistical analysis to highlight its characteristics, such as nonstationarity, nonnormality, seasonality, heteroscedasticity, structural breaks, asymmetric distributions, and intermittency, which are common in many real-world time series datasets and pose challenges for forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Deep Learning-based Anomaly Detection and Log Analysis for Computer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05639v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer network anomaly detection and log analysis, as an important topic in the field of network security, has been a key task to ensure network security and system reliability. First, existing network anomaly detection and log analysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex network topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive rates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle time-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis. Therefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these problems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an innovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a unique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data points, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data distribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the Transformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data. The synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust in anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of this fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection while reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network problems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and is able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the stability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces advanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log analysis.</p></details> | 38 pages |

| **[Dynamic Matrix Factor Models for High Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05624v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix time series, which consist of matrix-valued data observed over time, are prevalent in various fields such as economics, finance, and engineering. Such matrix time series data are often observed in high dimensions. Matrix factor models are employed to reduce the dimensionality of such data, but they lack the capability to make predictions without specified dynamics in the latent factor process. To address this issue, we propose a two-component dynamic matrix factor model that extends the standard matrix factor model by incorporating a matrix autoregressive structure for the low-dimensional latent factor process. This two-component model injects prediction capability to the matrix factor model and provides deeper insights into the dynamics of high-dimensional matrix time series. We present the estimation procedures of the model and their theoretical properties, as well as empirical analysis of the estimation procedures via simulations, and a case study of New York city taxi data, demonstrating the performance and usefulness of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10134v4)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction, an essential component for intelligent transportation systems, endeavours to use historical data to foresee future traffic features at specific locations. Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not improved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their fundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the ST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a spatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal patterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a fusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM to capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios.

We also introduce LRC units (LRCUs), as a very efficient and accurate gated RNN-model, which results from solving LRCs with an explicit Euler scheme using just one unfolding. We empirically show and formally prove that the liquid capacitance of LRCs considerably dampens the oscillations of LTCs and STCs, while at the same time dramatically increasing accuracy even for cheap solvers. We experimentally demonstrate that LRCs are a highly competitive alternative to popular neural ODEs and gated RNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, on classic time-series benchmarks and a complex autonomous-driving lane-keeping task.</p></details> |  |

However, the semantic space of LLMs, established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning with LLM ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embeddings space and perform time series forecasting based on learned prompts from the joint space. We first design a tokenization module tailored for cross-modality alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as prompts to provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations verify the necessity of prompt learning informed by semantic space.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAV-AD: A Robust Framework for Detection of Anomalous Data and Malicious Sensors in CAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05461v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has sparked considerable interest across diverse industries, including public transportation, underground mining, and agriculture sectors. However, CAVs' reliance on sensor readings makes them vulnerable to significant threats. Manipulating these readings can compromise CAV network security, posing serious risks for malicious activities. Although several anomaly detection (AD) approaches for CAV networks are proposed, they often fail to: i) detect multiple anomalies in specific sensor(s) with high accuracy or F1 score, and ii) identify the specific sensor being attacked. In response, this paper proposes a novel framework tailored to CAV networks, called CAV-AD, for distinguishing abnormal readings amidst multiple anomaly data while identifying malicious sensors. Specifically, CAV-AD comprises two main components: i) A novel CNN model architecture called optimized omni-scale CNN (O-OS-CNN), which optimally selects the time scale by generating all possible kernel sizes for input time series data; ii) An amplification block to increase the values of anomaly readings, enhancing sensitivity for detecting anomalies. Not only that, but CAV-AD integrates the proposed O-OS-CNN with a Kalman filter to instantly identify the malicious sensors. We extensively train CAV-AD using real-world datasets containing both instant and constant attacks, evaluating its performance in detecting intrusions from multiple anomalies, which presents a more challenging scenario. Our results demonstrate that CAV-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy of 98% and an average F1 score of 89\%, while accurately identifying the malicious sensors.</p></details> |  |

As these data capture the actual driving behaviour, they are expected to improve our understanding of driving risk and facilitate more accurate auto-insurance ratemaking. In this paper, we analyze an auto-insurance dataset with telematics data collected from a major European insurer. Through a detailed discussion of the telematics data structure and related data quality issues, we elaborate on practical challenges in processing and incorporating telematics information in loss modelling and ratemaking. Then, with an exploratory data analysis, we demonstrate the existence of heterogeneity in individual driving behaviour, even within the groups of policyholders with and without claims, which supports the study of telematics data. Our regression analysis reiterates the importance of telematics data in claims modelling; in particular, we propose a speed transition matrix that describes discretely recorded speed time series and produces statistically significant predictors for claim counts. We conclude that large speed transitions, together with higher maximum speed attained, nighttime driving and increased harsh braking, are associated with increased claim counts. Moreover, we empirically illustrate the learning effects in driving behaviour: we show that both severe harsh events detected at a high threshold and expected claim counts are not directly proportional with driving time or distance, but they increase at a decreasing rate.</p></details> |  |

| **[Topological Persistence Guided Knowledge Distillation for Wearable Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05315v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have achieved a lot of success in various applications involving converting wearable sensor data to actionable health insights. A common application areas is activity recognition, where deep-learning methods still suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to signal quality, sensor characteristic variations, and variability between subjects. To mitigate these issues, robust features obtained by topological data analysis (TDA) have been suggested as a potential solution. However, there are two significant obstacles to using topological features in deep learning: (1) large computational load to extract topological features using TDA, and (2) different signal representations obtained from deep learning and TDA which makes fusion difficult. In this paper, to enable integration of the strengths of topological methods in deep-learning for time-series data, we propose to use two teacher networks, one trained on the raw time-series data, and another trained on persistence images generated by TDA methods. The distilled student model utilizes only the raw time-series data at test-time. This approach addresses both issues. The use of KD with multiple teachers utilizes complementary information, and results in a compact model with strong supervisory features and an integrated richer representation. To assimilate desirable information from different modalities, we design new constraints, including orthogonality imposed on feature correlation maps for improving feature expressiveness and allowing the student to easily learn from the teacher. Also, we apply an annealing strategy in KD for fast saturation and better accommodation from different features, while the knowledge gap between the teachers and student is reduced. Finally, a robust student model is distilled, which uses only the time-series data as an input, while implicitly preserving topological features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Engin...</summary><p>Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 130, 107719</p></details> |

However, weather conditions such as precipitation, humidity, temperature, and wind impact these communication links. Usually, historical radio link Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their surrounding weather station observations are utilized for building learning-based RLF prediction models. However, such models must be capable of learning the spatial weather context in a dynamic RAN and effectively encoding time series KPIs with the weather observation data. Existing works fail to incorporate both of these essential design aspects of the prediction models. This paper fills the gap by proposing GenTrap, a novel RLF prediction framework that introduces a graph neural network (GNN)-based learnable weather effect aggregation module and employs state-of-the-art time series transformer as the temporal feature extractor for radio link failure prediction. The proposed aggregation method of GenTrap can be integrated into any existing prediction model to achieve better performance and generalizability. We evaluate GenTrap on two real-world datasets (rural and urban) with 2.6 million KPI data points and show that GenTrap offers a significantly higher F1-score (0.93 for rural and 0.79 for urban) compared to its counterparts while possessing generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Replacing conventional control methods with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in energy systems is an active area of research, as these systems become increasingly complex with the advent of renewable energy sources and the desire to improve their efficiency. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are vulnerable to specific perturbations of their inputs or features, called adversarial examples. These perturbations are difficult to detect when properly regularized, but have significant effects on the ANN's output. Because DRL uses ANN to map optimal actions to observations, they are similarly vulnerable to adversarial examples. This work proposes a novel attack technique for continuous control using Group Difference Logits loss with a bifurcation layer. By combining aspects of targeted and untargeted attacks, the attack significantly increases the impact compared to an untargeted attack, with drastically smaller distortions than an optimally targeted attack. We demonstrate the impacts of powerful gradient-based attacks in a realistic smart energy environment, show how the impacts change with different DRL agents and training procedures, and use statistical and time-series analysis to evaluate attacks' stealth. The results show that adversarial attacks can have significant impacts on DRL controllers, and constraining an attack's perturbations makes it difficult to detect. However, certain DRL architectures are far more robust, and robust training methods can further reduce the impact.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Real-world time series data often include noise, outliers, and missing values, making accurate forecasting challenging. Traditional methods model point-to-point relationships, which limits their ability to capture complex temporal patterns and increases their susceptibility to noise.To address these issues, we introduce the WindowMixer model, built on an all-MLP framework. WindowMixer leverages the continuous nature of time series by examining temporal variations from a window-based perspective. It decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, handling them individually. For trends, a fully connected (FC) layer makes predictions. For seasonal components, time windows are projected to produce window tokens, processed by Intra-Window-Mixer and Inter-Window-Mixer modules. The Intra-Window-Mixer models relationships within each window, while the Inter-Window-Mixer models relationships between windows. This approach captures intricate patterns and long-range dependencies in the data.Experiments show WindowMixer consistently outperforms existing methods in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have found some errors in the paper, involving inaccurate data, and therefore request to withdraw the manuscript</p></details> |

This component model is shown to be useful, in particular, for the modeling of time series with two types of seasonality, a long-period and a short period. This component model is also shown to be effective in the case of ordinary seasonal time series with only one seasonal component, if the seasonal pattern is simple and can be well represented by a small number of trigonometric components. As examples, electricity demand data, bi-hourly temperature data, CO2 data, and two economic time series are considered.

The algorithm demonstrates superior performance over the traditional GAN and transformer-based methods. However, the model's capability to follow natural language instructions (e.g., spatial relationships between objects, generating complex scenes) is still unsatisfactory. It has been an important research area to enhance such capability. Prior works have shown that using Reinforcement Learning can effectively train diffusion models to enhance fidelity on specific objectives. However, existing RL methods require collecting a large amount of data to train an effective reward model. They also don't receive feedback when the generated image is incorrect. In this work, we propose Iterative Prompt Relabeling (IPR), a novel algorithm that aligns images to text through iterative image sampling and prompt relabeling. IPR first samples a batch of images conditioned on the text then relabels the text prompts of unmatched text-image pairs with classifier feedback. We conduct thorough experiments on SDv2 and SDXL, testing their capability to follow instructions on spatial relations. With IPR, we improved up to 15.22% (absolute improvement) on the challenging spatial relation VISOR benchmark, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Resource Crop Classification from Multi-Spectral Time Series Using Lossless Compressors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18119v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of crop classification using multispectral temporal data. However, these models have complex structures with numerous parameters, requiring large amounts of data and costly training. In low-resource situations with fewer labeled samples, deep learning models perform poorly due to insufficient data. Conversely, compressors are data-type agnostic, and non-parametric methods do not bring underlying assumptions. Inspired by this insight, we propose a non-training alternative to deep learning models, aiming to address these situations. Specifically, the Symbolic Representation Module is proposed to convert the reflectivity into symbolic representations. The symbolic representations are then cross-transformed in both the channel and time dimensions to generate symbolic embeddings. Next, the Multi-scale Normalised Compression Distance (MNCD) is designed to measure the correlation between any two symbolic embeddings. Finally, based on the MNCDs, high quality crop classification can be achieved using only a k-nearest-neighbor classifier kNN. The entire framework is ready-to-use and lightweight. Without any training, it outperformed, on average, 7 advanced deep learning models trained at scale on three benchmark datasets. It also outperforms more than half of these models in the few-shot setting with sparse crop labels. Therefore, the high performance and robustness of our non-training framework makes it truly applicable to real-world crop mapping.

While benchmarks validate the performance of model generalization on various target data sets, there is no structured research providing similarity and diversity measures to explain which characteristics of source and target data lead to transfer learning success. Our study pioneers in systematically evaluating the impact of source-target similarity and source diversity on zero-shot and fine-tuned forecasting outcomes in terms of accuracy, bias, and uncertainty estimation. We investigate these dynamics using pre-trained neural networks across five public source datasets, applied to forecasting five target data sets, including real-world wholesales data. We identify two feature-based similarity and diversity measures, finding that source-target similarity reduces forecasting bias, while source diversity improves forecasting accuracy and uncertainty estimation, but increases the bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revitalizing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learnable Decomposition with Inter-Series Dependencies and Intra-Series Variations Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12694v5)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting multivariate time series is crucial, demanding precise modeling of intricate patterns, including inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations. Distinctive trend characteristics in each time series pose challenges, and existing methods, relying on basic moving average kernels, may struggle with the non-linear structure and complex trends in real-world data. Given that, we introduce a learnable decomposition strategy to capture dynamic trend information more reasonably. Additionally, we propose a dual attention module tailored to capture inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations simultaneously for better time series forecasting, which is implemented by channel-wise self-attention and autoregressive self-attention. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across eight open-source datasets and compared it with the state-of-the-art methods. Through the comparison results, our Leddam (LEarnable Decomposition and Dual Attention Module) not only demonstrates significant advancements in predictive performance, but also the proposed decomposition strategy can be plugged into other methods with a large performance-boosting, from 11.87% to 48.56% MSE error degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeLDM: Latent Diffusion Model for Unconditional Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04211v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation is a crucial research topic in the area of deep learning, which can be used for data augmentation, imputing missing values, and forecasting. Currently, latent diffusion models are ascending to the forefront of generative modeling for many important data representations. Being the most pivotal in the computer vision domain, latent diffusion models have also recently attracted interest in other communities, including NLP, Speech, and Geometric Space. In this work, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and realistic datasets, benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. Sores from Context-FID and Discriminative indicate that TimeLDM consistently and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art benchmarks with an average improvement of 3.4$\times$ and 3.8$\times$, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that our method presents better performance on different lengths of time series data generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential of the latent diffusion model for unconditional time series generation and establish a new baseline for synthetic time series.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of LLMs to analyze physiological time-series data remains an emerging research field. Particularly, there is a notable gap in the utilization of LLMs for analyzing wearable biosignals to achieve cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement, which is critical for the management of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents the first work to explore the capacity of LLMs to perform cuffless BP estimation based on wearable biosignals. We extracted physiological features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and designed context-enhanced prompts by combining these features with BP domain knowledge and user information. Subsequently, we adapted LLMs to BP estimation tasks through fine-tuning. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted assessments of ten advanced LLMs using a comprehensive public dataset of wearable biosignals from 1,272 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimally fine-tuned LLM significantly surpasses conventional task-specific baselines, achieving an estimation error of 0.00 $\pm$ 9.25 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.29 $\pm$ 6.37 mmHg for diastolic BP. Notably, the ablation studies highlight the benefits of our context enhancement strategy, leading to an 8.9% reduction in mean absolute error for systolic BP estimation. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for cuffless BP measurement, providing a potential solution to enhance the accuracy of cuffless BP measurement.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Autoencoder Architecture for L-band Passive Microwave Retrieval of Landscape Freeze-Thaw Cycle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04119v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the landscape and soil freeze-thaw (FT) dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere is crucial for understanding permafrost response to global warming and changes in regional and global carbon budgets. A new framework is presented for surface FT-cycle retrievals using L-band microwave radiometry based on a deep convolutional autoencoder neural network. This framework defines the landscape FT-cycle retrieval as a time series anomaly detection problem considering the frozen states as normal and thawed states as anomalies. The autoencoder retrieves the FT-cycle probabilistically through supervised reconstruction of the brightness temperature (TB) time series using a contrastive loss function that minimizes (maximizes) the reconstruction error for the peak winter (summer). Using the data provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, it is demonstrated that the framework learns to isolate the landscape FT states over different land surface types with varying complexities related to the radiometric characteristics of snow cover, lake-ice phenology, and vegetation canopy. The consistency of the retrievals is evaluated over Alaska, against in situ ground-based observations, showing reduced uncertainties compared to the traditional methods that use thresholding of the normalized polarization ratio.</p></details> |  |

While NJ-ODE was the first framework to establish convergence guarantees for the prediction of irregularly observed time series, these results were limited to data stemming from It\^o-diffusions with complete observations, in particular Markov processes, where all coordinates are observed simultaneously. In this work, we generalise these results to generic, possibly non-Markovian or discontinuous, stochastic processes with incomplete observations, by utilising the reconstruction properties of the signature transform. These theoretical results are supported by empirical studies, where it is shown that the path-dependent NJ-ODE outperforms the original NJ-ODE framework in the case of non-Markovian data. Moreover, we show that PD-NJ-ODE can be applied successfully to classical stochastic filtering problems and to limit order book (LOB) data.</p></details> |  |

This construction essentially decouples the two key features of cyclical long memory: quasi-periodicity and long-term persistence. It further allows for a general cyclical phase in cyclical long memory time series. Several choices for suitable bivariate long memory series are discussed, including a parametric fractionally integrated vector ARMA model. The parametric models introduced in this work have explicit autocovariance functions that can be used readily in simulation, estimation, and other tasks.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TwinLab: a framework for data-efficient training of non-intrusive reduced-order models for digital twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03924v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Simulation-based digital twins represent an effort to provide high-accuracy real-time insights into operational physical processes. However, the computation time of many multi-physical simulation models is far from real-time. It might even exceed sensible time frames to produce sufficient data for training data-driven reduced-order models. This study presents TwinLab, a framework for data-efficient, yet accurate training of neural-ODE type reduced-order models with only two data sets. Design/methodology/approach: Correlations between test errors of reduced-order models and distinct features of corresponding training data are investigated. Having found the single best data sets for training, a second data set is sought with the help of similarity and error measures to enrich the training process effectively. Findings: Adding a suitable second training data set in the training process reduces the test error by up to 49% compared to the best base reduced-order model trained only with one data set. Such a second training data set should at least yield a good reduced-order model on its own and exhibit higher levels of dissimilarity to the base training data set regarding the respective excitation signal. Moreover, the base reduced-order model should have elevated test errors on the second data set. The relative error of the time series ranges from 0.18% to 0.49%. Prediction speed-ups of up to a factor of 36,000 are observed. Originality: The proposed computational framework facilitates the automated, data-efficient extraction of non-intrusive reduced-order models for digital twins from existing simulation models, independent of the simulation software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version of the revised manuscript published in Engineering Computations</p></details> |

The volume of data generated by modern vehicles presents transmission, storage, and computational challenges. Focusing on Dynamic Behavior (DB) offers a promising approach to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information for ADS functionalities, thereby reducing data. Time series pattern recognition is beneficial for this task as it can analyze the temporal context of vehicle driving behavior. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often lack the adaptability to identify variable-length patterns or provide analytical descriptions of discovered patterns. This contribution proposes a Behavior Forest framework for real-time data selection by constructing a Behavior Graph during vehicle operation, facilitating analytical descriptions without pre-training. The method demonstrates its performance using a synthetically generated and electrocardiogram data set. An automotive time series data set is used to evaluate the data reduction capabilities, in which this method discarded 96.01% of the incoming data stream, while relevant DB remain included.</p></details> |  |

In this setting, time series anomaly detection is practically important. It endeavors to identify deviant samples from the normal sample distribution in time series. Existing approaches generally assume that all the time series is available at a central location. However, we are witnessing the decentralized collection of time series due to the deployment of various edge devices. To bridge the gap between the decentralized time series data and the centralized anomaly detection algorithms, we propose a Parameter-efficient Federated Anomaly Detection framework named PeFAD with the increasing privacy concerns. PeFAD for the first time employs the pre-trained language model (PLM) as the body of the client's local model, which can benefit from its cross-modality knowledge transfer capability. To reduce the communication overhead and local model adaptation cost, we propose a parameter-efficient federated training module such that clients only need to fine-tune small-scale parameters and transmit them to the server for update. PeFAD utilizes a novel anomaly-driven mask selection strategy to mitigate the impact of neglected anomalies during training. A knowledge distillation operation on a synthetic privacy-preserving dataset that is shared by all the clients is also proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue across clients. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real datasets, where PeFAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines by up to 28.74%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2024 (Research Track)</p></details> |

In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice, and facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On the other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the patient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress conditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is derived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like smartwatches and bracelets, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper presents a methodology for stress detection from a smartwatch based on a universal model for time series, UniTS, which we fine-tuned for the task. We cast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model adaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater control over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model considerably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on 3 benchmark datasets. Furthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless monitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive or lightweight devices.</p></details> |  |

Since the number of financial assets grows while the estimation window length remains of limited size, the often used sample estimator yields noisy estimates which are not even positive definite. Under the assumption of latent factor models, the covariance matrix is decomposed into a common low-rank component and a full-rank idiosyncratic component. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the idiosyncratic component, under the assumption of a grouped structure of the time series, which may arise due to specific factors such as industries, asset classes or countries. We propose a generalized methodology for estimation of the block-diagonal idiosyncratic component by clustering the residual series and applying shrinkage to the obtained blocks in order to ensure positive definiteness. We derive two different estimators based on different clustering methods and test their performance using simulation and historical data. The proposed methods are shown to provide reliable estimates and outperform other state-of-the-art estimators based on thresholding methods.</p></details> |  |

These models often rely on weighted averaging techniques over time intervals. However, real-world time series data is seldom isolated and is frequently influenced by non-numeric factors. For instance, stock price fluctuations are impacted by daily random events in the broader world, with each event exerting a unique influence on price signals. Previously, forecasts in financial markets have been approached in two main ways: either as time-series problems over price sequence or sentiment analysis tasks. The sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine whether news events will have a positive or negative impact on stock prices, often categorizing them into discrete labels. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to accurately model time series prediction, we propose a collaborative modeling framework that incorporates textual information about relevant events for predictions. Specifically, we leverage the intuition of large language models about future changes to update real number time series predictions. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach on financial market data.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

Adapting the similarity-based framework of Lin and Eck (2020), we exploit series that have experienced similar shocks. We aggregate their shock-induced excess volatilities by positing the shocks to be affine functions of exogenous covariates. The volatility shocks are modeled as random effects and estimated as fixed effects. The aggregation of these estimates is done in service of adjusting the $h$-step-ahead GARCH forecast of the time series under study by an additive term. The adjusted and unadjusted forecasts are evaluated using the unobservable but easily-estimated realized volatility (RV). A real-world application is provided, as are simulation results suggesting the conditions and hyperparameters under which our method thrives.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

In addition, we also examine whether additional information (such as the average degree of infected vertices) can help improving the results, compared to the case when we only know the time series consisting of the number of susceptible and infected individuals. Our simulation results also show which methods are most accurate in the different phases of the epidemic.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

Sensitive health data from patients is often used to train machine-learning models for diagnostics and ongoing care. Assessing the privacy risk of such models is crucial to making knowledgeable decisions on whether to use a model in production, share it with third parties, or deploy it in patients homes. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) are a key method for this kind of evaluation, however time-series prediction models have not been thoroughly studied in this context. We explore existing MIA techniques on time-series models, and introduce new features, focusing on the seasonality and trend components of the data. Seasonality is estimated using a multivariate Fourier transform, and a low-degree polynomial is used to approximate trends. We applied these techniques to various types of time-series models, using datasets from the health domain. Our results demonstrate that these new features enhance the effectiveness of MIAs in identifying membership, improving the understanding of privacy risks in medical data applications.</p></details> | 16 pages |

| **[Large Scale Hierarchical Industrial Demand Time-Series Forecasting incorporating Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02657v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2024 |

Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectories Forecasting with Probabilistic Feature Fusion for Problem Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v6)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of boosting the precision of multi-path long-term vessel trajectory forecasting on engineered sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using feature fusion for problem shifting. We have developed a deep auto-encoder model and a phased framework approach to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. To this end, we fuse the spatiotemporal features from the AIS messages with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data referring to potential routes and destinations. As a result, we reduce the forecasting uncertainty by shifting the problem into a trajectory reconstruction problem. The probabilistic features have an F1-Score of approximately 85% and 75% for the vessel route and destination prediction, respectively. Under such circumstances, we achieved an R2 Score of over 98% with different layer structures and varying feature combinations; the high R2 Score is a natural outcome of the well-defined shipping lanes in the study region. However, our proposal stands out among competing approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making during turnings and route selection. Furthermore, we have shown that our model achieves more accurate forecasting with average and median errors of 11km and 6km, respectively, a 25% improvement from the current state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting model from this proposal is deployed as part of a broader Decision Support System to safeguard whales by preventing the risk of vessel-whale collisions under the smartWhales initiative and acting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Atlantic Canada.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02502v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference; Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[The Hybrid Extended Bicycle: A Simple Model for High Dynamic Vehicle Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04857v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While highly automated driving relies most of the time on a smooth driving assumption, the possibility of a vehicle performing harsh maneuvers with high dynamic driving to face unexpected events is very likely. The modeling of the behavior of the vehicle in these events is crucial to proper planning and controlling; the used model should present accurate and computationally efficient properties to ensure consistency with the dynamics of the vehicle and to be employed in real-time systems. In this article, we propose an LSTM-based hybrid extended bicycle model able to present an accurate description of the state of the vehicle for both normal and aggressive situations. The introduced model is used in a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) plan and control framework for performing trajectories in high-dynamic scenarios. The proposed model and framework prove their ability to plan feasible trajectories ensuring an accurate vehicle behavior even at the limits of handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Transferability in Vision-Language Attacks via Diversification along the Intersection Region of Adversarial Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12445v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs).Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability.In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs.To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods.Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

For instance, the intricate flying behavior of migratory birds hinges on their analysis of environmental cues such as wind direction and air pressure. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of contextual information renders it an arduous task for AI models to comprehend its impact on trajectories and consequently predict them accurately. To address this issue, we propose a ``manager-worker'' framework to unleash the full potential of contextual information and construct CATP model, an implementation of the framework for Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction. The framework comprises a manager model, several worker models, and a tailored training mechanism inspired by competition symbiosis in nature. Taking CATP as an example, each worker needs to compete against others for training data and develop an advantage in predicting specific moving patterns. The manager learns the workers' performance in different contexts and selects the best one in the given context to predict trajectories, enabling CATP as a whole to operate in a symbiotic manner. We conducted two comparative experiments and an ablation study to quantitatively evaluate the proposed framework and CATP model. The results showed that CATP could outperform SOTA models, and the framework could be generalized to different context-aware tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, if relay technology is utilized unlawfully, it can amplify potential harm. Effectively surveilling illegitimate relay links poses a challenging problem. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can proactively surveil wireless relay systems due to their flexible mobility. This work focuses on maximizing the eavesdropping rate (ER) of UAVs by jointly optimizing the trajectory and jamming power. To address this challenge, we propose a new iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation technologies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the ER through trajectory and jamming power optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal for review</p></details> |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v4)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |

The majority of research is based on international data that does not apply to Pakistan's road conditions. We designed a complete pipeline for mining trajectories from sensors data. On this data, we employed state-of-the-art approaches, including a shallow artificial neural network, a deep multi-layered perceptron, and a long-short-term memory, to explore the issue of travel time prediction on frequent routes.

This paper presents the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction model (HLTP++), which emulates human cognitive processes to improve trajectory prediction in AD. HLTP++ incorporates a novel teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The "teacher" model equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. On the other hand, the "student" model focuses on real-time interaction and human decision-making, drawing parallels to the human memory storage mechanism. Furthermore, we improve the model's efficiency by introducing a new Fourier Adaptive Spike Neural Network (FA-SNN), allowing for faster and more precise predictions with fewer parameters. Evaluated using the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD benchmarks, HLTP++ demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, which reduces the predicted trajectory error with over 11% on the NGSIM dataset and 25% on the HighD datasets. Moreover, HLTP++ demonstrates strong adaptability in challenging environments with incomplete input data. This marks a significant stride in the journey towards fully AD systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2402.19251</p></details> |

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLP 2024</p></details> |

| **[MSTF: Multiscale Transformer for Incomplete Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05671v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to execute collision warnings and rational local-path planning based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, prevalent methods often assume complete observed trajectories, neglecting the potential impact of missing values induced by object occlusion, scope limitation, and sensor failures. Such oversights inevitably compromise the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed Multiscale Transformer (MSTF), meticulously crafted for incomplete trajectory prediction. MSTF integrates a Multiscale Attention Head (MAH) and an Information Increment-based Pattern Adaptive (IIPA) module. Specifically, the MAH component concurrently captures multiscale motion representation of trajectory sequence from various temporal granularities, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism. This approach facilitates the modeling of global dependencies in motion across different scales, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, the IIPA module adaptively extracts continuity representation of motion across time steps by analyzing missing patterns in the data. The continuity representation delineates motion trend at a higher level, guiding MSTF to generate predictions consistent with motion continuity. We evaluate our proposed MSTF model using two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MSTF surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the task of incomplete trajectory prediction, showcasing its efficacy in addressing the challenges posed by missing values in motion forecasting for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |

A data-driven approach consists on to deduce behaviors that may exist in real situation to obtain different types of trajectories from a large set of observations. The data, and its classification, could then be used to train models capable to extrapolate such behavior. Cars and two different types of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) will be considered by the trajectory clustering methods proposed: pedestrians and cyclists. The results reported here evaluate methods to extract well-defined trajectory classes from raw data without the use of map information while also separating ''eccentric'' or incomplete trajectories from the ones that are complete and representative in any scenario. Two environments will serve as test for the methods develop, three different intersections and one roundabout. The resulting clusters of trajectories can then be used for prediction or learning tasks or discarded if it is composed by outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PWTO: A Heuristic Approach for Trajectory Optimization in Complex Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02745v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a trajectory planning problem for a robot navigating complex terrains, which arises in applications ranging from autonomous mining vehicles to planetary rovers. The problem seeks to find a low-cost dynamically feasible trajectory for the robot. The problem is challenging as it requires solving a non-linear optimization problem that often has many local minima due to the complex terrain. To address the challenge, we propose a method called Pareto-optimal Warm-started Trajectory Optimization (PWTO) that attempts to combine the benefits of graph search and trajectory optimization, two very different approaches to planning. PWTO first creates a state lattice using simplified dynamics of the robot and leverages a multi-objective graph search method to obtain a set of paths. Each of the paths is then used to warm-start a local trajectory optimization process, so that different local minima are explored to find a globally low-cost solution. In our tests, the solution cost computed by PWTO is often less than half of the costs computed by the baselines. In addition, we verify the trajectories generated by PWTO in Gazebo simulation in complex terrains with both wheeled and quadruped robots. The code of this paper is open sourced and can be found at https://github.com/rap-lab-org/public_pwto.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Included reference to codebase.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the double-blind review process.</p></details> |  |

These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths. Our experiments demonstrate AdaFold's ability to adapt folding trajectories to cloths with varying physical properties and generalize from simulated training to real-world execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

Existing methods are facing difficulties when dealing with such cases. We consider that a continuous and smooth trajectory is critical in boosting small infrared aerial target detection performance. A simple and effective small aerial target detection method for airborne infrared detection system using light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) and trajectory constraints is proposed in this article. First, we simply formulate target candidate detection as a binary classification problem. Target candidates in every individual frame are detected via interesting pixel detection and a trained LightGBM model. Then, the local smoothness and global continuous characteristic of the target trajectory are modeled as short-strict and long-loose constraints. The trajectory constraints are used efficiently for detecting the true small infrared aerial targets from numerous target candidates. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other existing methods. Furthermore, a public dataset for small aerial target detection in airborne infrared detection systems is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset has the largest data scale and richest scene types within this field.</p></details> | 15 pages,10 figures |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

This inherent difficulty curtails the broader application of RL within game environments characterized by diverse constraints. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) presents a pioneering framework that capitalizes on human preferences as pivotal reward signals, thereby circumventing the need for meticulous reward engineering. However, obtaining preference data from human experts is costly and inefficient, especially under conditions marked by complex constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose a LLM-enabled automatic preference generation framework named LLM4PG , which harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to abstract trajectories, rank preferences, and reconstruct reward functions to optimize conditioned policies. Experiments on tasks with complex language constraints demonstrated the effectiveness of our LLM-enabled reward functions, accelerating RL convergence and overcoming stagnation caused by slow or absent progress under original reward structures. This approach mitigates the reliance on specialized human knowledge and demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance RL's effectiveness in complex environments in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCAI 2024 GAAMAL</p></details> |

To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals. This paper introduces the task of goal identification from observed UI trajectories, aiming to infer the user's intended task based on their GUI interactions. We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment. By Leveraging the inverse relation with the UI automation task, we utilized the Android-In-The-Wild and Mind2Web datasets for our experiments. Using our metric and these datasets, we conducted several experiments comparing the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our results show that Gemini performs better than GPT but still underperforms compared to humans, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a new framework to enable fast, omnidirectional jumping capabilities for quadruped robots. Utilizing minimum jerk technology, the proposed framework efficiently generates jump trajectories that exploit its analytical solutions, ensuring numerical stability and dynamic compatibility with minimal computational resources. The virtual model control is employed to formulate a Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization problem to accurately track the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories during the jump phase. The whole-body control strategies facilitate precise and compliant landing motion. Moreover, the different jumping phase is triggered by time-schedule. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through its implementation on an enhanced version of the open-source Mini Cheetah robot. Omnidirectional jumps-including forward, backward, and other directional-were successfully executed, showcasing the robot's capability to perform rapid and consecutive jumps with an average trajectory generation and tracking solution time of merely 50 microseconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS2...</summary><p>IROS2024 paper,7 pages,8 figures</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

| **[StreamMOTP: Streaming and Unified Framework for Joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19844v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking and trajectory prediction are two crucial modules in autonomous driving systems. Generally, the two tasks are handled separately in traditional paradigms and a few methods have started to explore modeling these two tasks in a joint manner recently. However, these approaches suffer from the limitations of single-frame training and inconsistent coordinate representations between tracking and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a streaming and unified framework for joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and trajectory Prediction (StreamMOTP) to address the above challenges. Firstly, we construct the model in a streaming manner and exploit a memory bank to preserve and leverage the long-term latent features for tracked objects more effectively. Secondly, a relative spatio-temporal positional encoding strategy is introduced to bridge the gap of coordinate representations between the two tasks and maintain the pose-invariance for trajectory prediction. Thirdly, we further improve the quality and consistency of predicted trajectories with a dual-stream predictor. We conduct extensive experiments on popular nuSences dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of StreamMOTP, which outperforms previous methods significantly on both tasks. Furthermore, we also prove that the proposed framework has great potential and advantages in actual applications of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stable and Storage-efficient Dataset Distillation: Matching Convexified Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19827v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of deep learning and large language models has led to an exponential growth in the demand for training data, prompting the development of Dataset Distillation methods to address the challenges of managing large datasets. Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT leverages insights from the linearized dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel methods to create a convex combination of expert trajectories, guiding the student network to converge rapidly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables a continuous sampling strategy during distillation, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory. Comprehensive experiments across three public datasets validate the superiority of MCT over traditional MTT methods.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Our approach consists of a 2-fork neural network fed with sensing and localization data, able to communicate intermediate learned features among the agents. One network branch crafts an initial collision-free trajectory estimate, while the other devises a neural collision constraint for subsequent optimization, ensuring trajectory continuity and adherence to physicalactuation limits. Extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments, involving up to 25 robots and 25% obstacle density, show a collision avoidance success rate in the range of 100 -- 85%. Finally, we introduce a saliency map computation method acting on the point cloud data, offering qualitative insights into our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Viewport Prediction for Volumetric Video Streaming by Exploring Video Saliency and Trajectory Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16462v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

This framework leverages recent advancements in discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) models to adeptly handle the temporal dynamics inherent in dynamic graphs. DyGETViz effectively captures both micro- and macro-level structural shifts within these graphs, offering a robust method for representing complex and massive dynamic graphs. The application of DyGETViz extends to a diverse array of domains, including ethology, epidemiology, finance, genetics, linguistics, communication studies, social studies, and international relations. Through its implementation, DyGETViz has revealed or confirmed various critical insights. These include the diversity of content sharing patterns and the degree of specialization within online communities, the chronological evolution of lexicons across decades, and the distinct trajectories exhibited by aging-related and non-related genes. Importantly, DyGETViz enhances the accessibility of scientific findings to non-domain experts by simplifying the complexities of dynamic graphs. Our framework is released as an open-source Python package for use across diverse disciplines.

Differentially private publication mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework, we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain. Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added DOI: 10.56553/popets-2024-0068</p></details> |

LiDAR point clouds can be used directly to assemble 3D models if their positions are accurately determined. AeroTraj uses SLAM for this, but must ensure complete and accurate reconstruction while minimizing drone battery usage. Doing this requires balancing competing constraints: drone speed, height, and orientation. AeroTraj exploits building geometry in designing an optimal trajectory that incorporates these constraints. Even with an optimal trajectory, SLAM's position error can drift over time, so AeroTraj tracks drift in-flight by offloading computations to the cloud and invokes a re-calibration procedure to minimize error. AeroTraj can reconstruct large structures with centimeter-level accuracy and with an average end-to-end latency below 250 ms, significantly outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

The Fiedler value is adopted as communication performance metric. The validity of the method in computing both feasible and optimal trajectories for the robots is demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally. Results show that the constraint on the Fiedler value ensures that the robot network fulfils its objective while maintaining communication connectivity at all times. Further, the paper shows that the introduction of approximations for the constraints enables a significant improvement in the computational time of the solution, which remain very close to the optimal solution.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel method for pedestrian trajectory prediction, called multi-stage goal-driven network (MGNet). Diverging from prior approaches relying on stepwise recursive prediction and the singular forecasting of a long-term goal, MGNet directs trajectory generation by forecasting intermediate stage goals, thereby reducing prediction errors. The network comprises three main components: a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), an attention module, and a multi-stage goal evaluator. Trajectories are encoded using conditional variational autoencoders to acquire knowledge about the approximate distribution of pedestrians' future trajectories, and combined with an attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependency between trajectory sequences. The pivotal module is the multi-stage goal evaluator, which utilizes the encoded feature vectors to predict intermediate goals, effectively minimizing cumulative errors in the recursive inference process. The effectiveness of MGNet is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the JAAD and PIE datasets. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms reveal significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by 5th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL 2024)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a method that leverages anticipatory road data, such as speed limits, road slopes, and traffic lights, beyond the local perception range to optimize energy-efficient braking trajectories. For that, coasting, which reduces energy consumption, and active braking are combined to transition from the current vehicle velocity to a lower target velocity at a given distance ahead. Finding the switching instants between the coasting phases and the continuous control for the braking phase is addressed as an optimal trade-off between maximizing coasting periods and minimizing braking effort. The resulting switched optimal control problem is solved by deriving necessary optimality conditions. To facilitate the incorporation of additional feasibility constraints for multi-phase trajectories, a sub-optimal alternative solution based on parametric optimization is proposed. Both methods are compared in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear at the European Control Conference 2024 (ECC'24)</p></details> |

However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. (2) Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the Decorator, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. (3) Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the Detailer, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/imlixinyang/director3d</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}.

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Following an initial exploration phase where agents try out different actions, they eventually converge onto a particular policy. As this occurs, the distribution over state-action trajectories becomes narrower, leading agents to repeatedly experience the same transitions. This repetitive exposure fosters spurious correlations between certain observations and rewards. Agents may then pick up on these correlations and develop simplistic habits tailored to the specific set of trajectories dictated by their policy. The problem is that these habits may yield incorrect outcomes when agents are forced to deviate from their typical trajectories, prompted by changes in the environment. This paper presents a mathematical characterization of this phenomenon, termed policy confounding, and illustrates, through a series of examples, the circumstances under which it occurs.</p></details> |  |

Towards this end, we introduce some natural notions of the complexity of optimization trajectories, both qualitative and quantitative, which hallmark the directional nature of optimization in neural networks: when is there redundancy, and when exploration. We use them to reveal the inherent nuance and interplay involved between various optimization choices, such as momentum and weight decay. Further, the trajectory perspective helps us see the effect of scale on regularizing the directional nature of trajectories, and as a by-product, we also observe an intriguing heterogeneity of Q,K,V dynamics in the middle attention layers in LLMs and which is homogenized by scale. Importantly, we put the significant directional redundancy observed to the test by demonstrating that training only scalar batchnorm parameters some while into training matches the performance of training the entire network, which thus exhibits the potential of hybrid optimization schemes that are geared towards efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint, 57 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Feasible and Stable White-Box Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01763v4)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of Trajectory Optimization (TO) for a general class of stiff and constrained dynamic systems. We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

With the change in modern UAV application scenarios, it is required that UAVs have fast maneuverable three-dimensional flight capabilities. Due to the highly nonlinear aerodynamics produced by the fuselage and wings of the tail-sitter, how to quickly generate a smooth and executable trajectory is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. We constrain the speed of the tail-sitter, eliminate the differential dynamics constraints in the trajectory generation process of the tail-sitter through differential flatness, and allocate the time variable of the trajectory through the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method named MINCO. By discretizing the trajectory in time, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint, thereby achieving the time-optimal trajectory for the tail-sitter to fly through any given waypoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dynamic Control Barrier Function Based Trajectory Planning for Mobile Manipulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15806v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional robot dynamic trajectory planning poses many challenges for traditional planning algorithms. Existing planning methods suffer from issues such as long computation times, limited capacity to address intricate obstacle models, and lack of consideration for external disturbances and measurement inaccuracies in these high-dimensional systems. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning approach that combines Dynamic Control Barrier Function (DCBF) with a disturbance observer to create a Robust Dynamic Control Barrier Function (RDCBF) planner. This approach successfully plans trajectories in environments with complex dynamic obstacles while accounting for external disturbances and measurement uncertainties, ensuring system safety and enabling precise obstacle avoidance. Experimental results on a mobile manipulator demonstrate outstanding performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of Trajectories for Machine Learning Training in Robot Accuracy Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15620v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been developed for increasing the accuracy of robot mechanisms. Complex mechanical issues such as non-linear friction, backlash, flexibility of structure transmission elements can cause these errors and they are hard to model. ML requires training data and the above mechanical phenomena are highly dependent on position of the robot in the workspace and also on its velocity, especially near zero velocity in both directions where non-linearities such as Streibek and Coulomb friction are most pronounced. It is well known that success of ML methods depends on amount of training data and it is expensive/time consuming to collect data from physical robot motion. We therefore address the problem of searching for trajectories in the 6D space of positions and velocities which collect the most information in the least amount of time. This reduces to a special case of the traveling-salesman problem in that the robot must be programmed to visit sampled points in the position-velocity phase space most efficiently. Two goals of this work are 1) Computationally study the difficulty of the TSP in this application by applying it to X, Y, Z motion in 3D space (6D phase space) and 2) assess the effectiveness of an extremely simple Nearest Neighbor search algorithm compared to random sampling of the search space. Results confirm that Nearest Neighbor heuristic searching produces significantly better trajectories than random sampling in this application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extraction of 3D trajectories of mandibular condyles from 2D real-time MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14925v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing the trajectories of mandibular condyles directly from MRI could provide a comprehensive examination, allowing for the extraction of both anatomical and kinematic details. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of extracting 3D condylar trajectories from 2D real-time MRI and to assess their precision.Twenty healthy subjects underwent real-time MRI while opening and closing their jaws. One axial and two sagittal slices were segmented using a U-Net-based algorithm. The centers of mass of the resulting masks were projected onto the coordinate system based on anatomical markers and temporally adjusted using a common projection. The quality of the computed trajectories was evaluated using metrics designed to estimate movement reproducibility, head motion, and slice placement symmetry.The segmentation of the axial slices demonstrated good-to-excellent quality; however, the segmentation of the sagittal slices required some fine-tuning. The movement reproducibility was acceptable for most cases; nevertheless, head motion displaced the trajectories by 1 mm on average. The difference in the superior-inferior coordinate of the condyles in the closed jaw position was 1.7 mm on average.Despite limitations in precision, real-time MRI enables the extraction of condylar trajectories with sufficient accuracy for evaluating clinically relevant parameters such as condyle displacement, trajectories aspect, and symmetry.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTOP addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTOP is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTOP for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTOP outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Singular knee identification to support emergence recognition in physical swarm and cellular automata trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14652v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After decades of attention, emergence continues to lack a centralized mathematical definition that leads to a rigorous emergence test applicable to physical flocks and swarms, particularly those containing both deterministic elements (eg, interactions) and stochastic perturbations like measurement noise. This study develops a heuristic test based on singular value curve analysis of data matrices containing deterministic and Gaussian noise signals. The minimum detection criteria are identified, and statistical and matrix space analysis developed to determine upper and lower bounds. This study applies the analysis to representative examples by using recorded trajectories of mixed deterministic and stochastic trajectories for multi-agent, cellular automata, and biological video. Examples include Cucker Smale and Vicsek flocking, Gaussian noise and its integration, recorded observations of bird flocking, and 1D cellular automata. Ensemble simulations including measurement noise are performed to compute statistical variation and discussed relative to random matrix theory noise bounds. The results indicate singular knee analysis of recorded trajectories can detect gradated levels on a continuum of structure and noise. Across the eight singular value decay metrics considered, the angle subtended at the singular value knee emerges with the most potential for supporting cross-embodiment emergence detection, the size of noise bounds is used as an indication of required sample size, and the presence of a large fraction of singular values inside noise bounds as an indication of noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures; includes 2 supplementary pages</p></details> |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[FutureNet-LOF: Joint Trajectory Prediction and Lane Occupancy Field Prediction with Future Context Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14422v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most prior motion prediction endeavors in autonomous driving have inadequately encoded future scenarios, leading to predictions that may fail to accurately capture the diverse movements of agents (e.g., vehicles or pedestrians). To address this, we propose FutureNet, which explicitly integrates initially predicted trajectories into the future scenario and further encodes these future contexts to enhance subsequent forecasting. Additionally, most previous motion forecasting works have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent. However, safe and smooth autonomous driving requires accurately predicting the diverse future behaviors of numerous surrounding agents jointly in complex dynamic environments. Given that all agents occupy certain potential travel spaces and possess lane driving priority, we propose Lane Occupancy Field (LOF), a new representation with lane semantics for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. LOF can simultaneously capture the joint probability distribution of all road participants' future spatial-temporal positions. Due to the high compatibility between lane occupancy field prediction and trajectory prediction, we propose a novel network with future context encoding for the joint prediction of these two tasks. Our approach ranks 1st on two large-scale motion forecasting benchmarks: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Our model considers the intentions of other vehicles in the decision-making process and provides the AV with a human-like trajectory, based on the clothoid interpolation technique.% This study investigates a solver based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that quickly converges to an optimal decision.Among highly interactive traffic scenarios, the intersection crossing is particularly challenging. Hence, we choose to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method in real traffic conditions, using an experimental autonomous vehicle at an unsignalized intersection. Testing results reveal that our approach is suitable for 1) Making decisions and generating trajectories simultaneously. 2) Describing the vehicle's trajectory as a piecewise clothoid and enforcing geometric constraints. 3) Reducing search space dimensionality for the trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-Driven Closed-Loop Grasping with Model-Predictive Trajectory Replanning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09039v3)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining a vision module inside a closed-loop control system for a \emph{seamless movement} of a robot in a manipulation task is challenging due to the inconsistent update rates between utilized modules. This task is even more difficult in a dynamic environment, e.g., objects are moving. This paper presents a \emph{modular} zero-shot framework for language-driven manipulation of (dynamic) objects through a closed-loop control system with real-time trajectory replanning and an online 6D object pose localization. We segment an object within $\SI{0.5}{\second}$ by leveraging a vision language model via language commands. Then, guided by natural language commands, a closed-loop system, including a unified pose estimation and tracking and online trajectory planning, is utilized to continuously track this object and compute the optimal trajectory in real-time. Our proposed zero-shot framework provides a smooth trajectory that avoids jerky movements and ensures the robot can grasp a non-stationary object. Experiment results exhibit the real-time capability of the proposed zero-shot modular framework for the trajectory optimization module to accurately and efficiently grasp moving objects, i.e., up to \SI{30}{\hertz} update rates for the online 6D pose localization module and \SI{10}{\hertz} update rates for the receding-horizon trajectory optimization. These advantages highlight the modular framework's potential applications in robotics and human-robot interaction; see the video in https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/6e64/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |

Signatures have recently been widely adopted in machine learning problems for time series analysis. In this work we establish connections between value functions typically used in optimal control and intriguing properties of path signatures. These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories. We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control. In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable for problems with unknown disturbances. The proposed algorithms are tested in simulation, with differentiable physics models including typical control and robotics tasks such as point-mass, curve following for an ant model, and a robotic manipulator.</p></details> | 48 pages, 21 figures |

In this work, we present the first stochastic causal temporal framework to model the continuous temporal evolution of disease progression via Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE). The proposed causal inference model takes as input the patient's high dimensional images (MRI) and tabular data, and predicts both factual and counterfactual progression trajectories on different treatments in latent space. The NSDE permits the estimation of high-confidence personalized trajectories and treatment effects. Extensive experiments were performed on a large, multi-centre, proprietary dataset of patient 3D MRI and clinical data acquired during several randomized clinical trials for MS treatments. Our results present the first successful uncertainty-based causal Deep Learning (DL) model to: (a) accurately predict future patient MS disability evolution (e.g. EDSS) and treatment effects leveraging baseline MRI, and (b) permit the discovery of subgroups of patients for which the model has high confidence in their response to treatment even in clinical trials which did not reach their clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models as Zero-Shot Trajectory Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11604v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as high-level planners for robots when given access to a selection of low-level skills. However, it is often assumed that LLMs do not possess sufficient knowledge to be used for the low-level trajectories themselves. In this work, we address this assumption thoroughly, and investigate if an LLM (GPT-4) can directly predict a dense sequence of end-effector poses for manipulation tasks, when given access to only object detection and segmentation vision models. We designed a single, task-agnostic prompt, without any in-context examples, motion primitives, or external trajectory optimisers. Then we studied how well it can perform across 30 real-world language-based tasks, such as "open the bottle cap" and "wipe the plate with the sponge", and we investigated which design choices in this prompt are the most important. Our conclusions raise the assumed limit of LLMs for robotics, and we reveal for the first time that LLMs do indeed possess an understanding of low-level robot control sufficient for a range of common tasks, and that they can additionally detect failures and then re-plan trajectories accordingly.

| **[Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction Under Distributional Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Crossfusor: A Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model for Car-Following Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11941v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. While traditional methods have laid foundational work, modern deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models and generative approaches, have significantly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex and non-linear patterns in vehicle motion and traffic interactions. However, these models often overlook the detailed car-following behaviors and inter-vehicle interactions essential for real-world driving scenarios. This study introduces a Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model (Crossfusor) specifically designed for car-following trajectory prediction. Crossfusor integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a robust diffusion framework, improving both the accuracy and realism of predicted trajectories. The model leverages a novel temporal feature encoding framework combining GRU, location-based attention mechanisms, and Fourier embedding to capture historical vehicle dynamics. It employs noise scaled by these encoded historical features in the forward diffusion process, and uses a cross-attention transformer to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies in the reverse denoising process. Experimental results on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that Crossfusor outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in long-term predictions, showcasing its potential for enhancing the predictive capabilities of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version. 40 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[A First Physical-World Trajectory Prediction Attack via LiDAR-induced Deceptions in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11707v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction forecasts nearby agents' moves based on their historical trajectories. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Existing attacks compromise the prediction model of a victim AV by directly manipulating the historical trajectory of an attacker AV, which has limited real-world applicability. This paper, for the first time, explores an indirect attack approach that induces prediction errors via attacks against the perception module of a victim AV. Although it has been shown that physically realizable attacks against LiDAR-based perception are possible by placing a few objects at strategic locations, it is still an open challenge to find an object location from the vast search space in order to launch effective attacks against prediction under varying victim AV velocities. Through analysis, we observe that a prediction model is prone to an attack focusing on a single point in the scene. Consequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework to realize the single-point attack. The first stage of prediction-side attack efficiently identifies, guided by the distribution of detection results under object-based attacks against perception, the state perturbations for the prediction model that are effective and velocity-insensitive. In the second stage of location matching, we match the feasible object locations with the found state perturbations. Our evaluation using a public autonomous driving dataset shows that our attack causes a collision rate of up to 63% and various hazardous responses of the victim AV. The effectiveness of our attack is also demonstrated on a real testbed car. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first security analysis spanning from LiDAR-based perception to prediction in autonomous driving, leading to a realistic attack on prediction. To counteract the proposed attack, potential defenses are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium 2024</p></details> |

This approach addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting by leveraging the generation of trajectories from previously encountered tasks to augment the current dataset.

Currently, there exists no principled mathematical theory for their dynamics -- a grand-challenge open problem. Here, we show that the popularity and similarity trajectories of nodes in hyperbolic embeddings of different real networks manifest universal self-similar properties with typical Hurst exponents $H \ll 0.5$. This means that the trajectories are predictable, displaying anti-persistent or 'mean-reverting' behavior, and they can be adequately captured by a fractional Brownian motion process. The observed behavior can be qualitatively reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not in networks that lack such space, suggesting that the observed subdiffusive dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks. These results set the foundations for rigorous mathematical machinery for describing and predicting real network dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Certain trajectories may not be tracked as single, continuous paths due to the robot's kinematic constraints or obstacles elsewhere in the environment. In this situation, it becomes necessary to divide the trajectory into shorter segments. Each such division introduces a reconfiguration, in which the robot deviates from the reference trajectory, repositions itself in configuration space, and then resumes task execution. The occurrence of reconfigurations should be minimized because they increase the time and energy usage. In this paper, we present IKLink, a method for finding joint motions to track reference end-effector trajectories while executing minimal reconfigurations. Our graph-based method generates a diverse set of Inverse Kinematics (IK) solutions for every waypoint on the reference trajectory and utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal motion by linking the IK solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IKLink through a simulation experiment and an illustrative demonstration using a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a contributed paper at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline.

| **[PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-based Multiagent Trajectory Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10060v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

However, the algorithms chosen by existing research (sorting, Breadth-First search, shortest path finding, etc.) usually align perfectly with a standard GNN architecture. This report describes how neural execution is applied to a complex algorithm, such as finding maximum bipartite matching by reducing it to a flow problem and using Ford-Fulkerson to find the maximum flow. This is achieved via neural execution based only on features generated from a single GNN. The evaluation shows strongly generalising results with the network achieving optimal matching almost 100% of the time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Generalization of Graph Neural Networks for Carrier Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08479v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery-free sensor tags are devices that leverage backscatter techniques to communicate with standard IoT devices, thereby augmenting a network's sensing capabilities in a scalable way. For communicating, a sensor tag relies on an unmodulated carrier provided by a neighboring IoT device, with a schedule coordinating this provisioning across the network. Carrier scheduling--computing schedules to interrogate all sensor tags while minimizing energy, spectrum utilization, and latency--is an NP-Hard optimization problem. Recent work introduces learning-based schedulers that achieve resource savings over a carefully-crafted heuristic, generalizing to networks of up to 60 nodes. However, we find that their advantage diminishes in networks with hundreds of nodes, and degrades further in larger setups. This paper introduces RobustGANTT, a GNN-based scheduler that improves generalization (without re-training) to networks up to 1000 nodes (100x training topology sizes). RobustGANTT not only achieves better and more consistent generalization, but also computes schedules requiring up to 2x less resources than existing systems. Our scheduler exhibits average runtimes of hundreds of milliseconds, allowing it to react fast to changing network conditions. Our work not only improves resource utilization in large-scale backscatter networks, but also offers valuable insights in learning-based scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages, 12 Figures.

However, the proliferation of ML approaches has made it challenging for scientists to keep up with the most promising techniques. This paper presents an empirical study on Geometric Graph Neural Networks for 3D atomic systems, focusing on the impact of different (1) canonicalization methods, (2) graph creation strategies, and (3) auxiliary tasks, on performance, scalability and symmetry enforcement.

| **[SparseRadNet: Sparse Perception Neural Network on Subsampled Radar Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10600v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar-based perception has gained increasing attention in autonomous driving, yet the inherent sparsity of radars poses challenges. Radar raw data often contains excessive noise, whereas radar point clouds retain only limited information. In this work, we holistically treat the sparse nature of radar data by introducing an adaptive subsampling method together with a tailored network architecture that exploits the sparsity patterns to discover global and local dependencies in the radar signal. Our subsampling module selects a subset of pixels from range-doppler (RD) spectra that contribute most to the downstream perception tasks. To improve the feature extraction on sparse subsampled data, we propose a new way of applying graph neural networks on radar data and design a novel two-branch backbone to capture both global and local neighbor information. An attentive fusion module is applied to combine features from both branches. Experiments on the RADIal dataset show that our SparseRadNet exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in object detection and achieves close to SOTA accuracy in freespace segmentation, meanwhile using sparse subsampled input data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols. To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios. The data and code of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/NineAbyss/GLBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.10280 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Graph convolutional network for predicting abnormal grain growth in Monte Carlo simulations of microstructural evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09326v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in graph neural networks show promise for predicting the occurrence of abnormal grain growth, which has been a particularly challenging area of research due to its apparent stochastic nature. In this study, we generate a large dataset of Monte Carlo simulations of abnormal grain growth. We train simple graph convolution networks to predict which initial microstructures will exhibit abnormal grain growth, and compare the results to a standard computer vision approach for the same task. The graph neural network outperformed the computer vision method and achieved 73% prediction accuracy and fewer false positives. It also provided some physical insight into feature importance and the relevant length scale required to maximize predictive performance. Analysis of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulations provides additional insights for ongoing work in this area.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TinyGraph: Joint Feature and Node Condensation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08064v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs can be challenging due to the high computational expense caused by the massive number of nodes and high-dimensional nodal features. Existing graph condensation studies tackle this problem only by reducing the number of nodes in the graph. However, the resulting condensed graph data can still be cumbersome. Specifically, although the nodes of the Citeseer dataset are reduced to 0.9% (30 nodes) in training, the number of features is 3,703, severely exceeding the training sample magnitude. Faced with this challenge, we study the problem of joint condensation for both features and nodes in large-scale graphs. This task is challenging mainly due to 1) the intertwined nature of the node features and the graph structure calls for the feature condensation solver to be structure-aware; and 2) the difficulty of keeping useful information in the condensed graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework TinyGraph, to condense features and nodes simultaneously in graphs. Specifically, we cast the problem as matching the gradients of GNN weights trained on the condensed graph and the gradients obtained from training over the original graph, where the feature condensation is achieved by a trainable function. The condensed graph obtained by minimizing the matching loss along the training trajectory can henceforth retain critical information in the original graph. Extensive experiments were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TinyGraph. For example, a GNN trained with TinyGraph retains 98.5% and 97.5% of the original test accuracy on the Cora and Citeseer datasets, respectively, while significantly reducing the number of nodes by 97.4% and 98.2%, and the number of features by 90.0% on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks for Road-Level Traffic Accident Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05072v3)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic accidents present substantial challenges to human safety and socio-economic development in urban areas. Developing a reliable and responsible traffic accident prediction model is crucial to addressing growing public safety concerns and enhancing the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of highrisk accidents and the predominance of non-accident characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of accidents, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of accident risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Zero-Inflated Tweedie Graph Neural Network STZITDGNN -- the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in roadlevel traffic accident prediction for multisteps. This model integrates the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family model and the expressive power of graph neural networks. Its decoder innovatively employs a compound Tweedie model,a Poisson distribution to model the frequency of accident occurrences and a Gamma distribution to assess injury severity, supplemented by a zeroinflated component to effectively identify exessive nonincident instances. Empirical tests using realworld traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITDGNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks and metrics, including accident risk value prediction, uncertainty minimisation, non-accident road identification and accident occurrence accuracy. Our study demonstrates that STZTIDGNN can effectively inform targeted road monitoring, thereby improving urban road safety strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiGraph: Material-Adaptive Graph-Based Neural Dynamics for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07889v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive models are a crucial component of many robotic systems. Yet, constructing accurate predictive models for a variety of deformable objects, especially those with unknown physical properties, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces AdaptiGraph, a learning-based dynamics modeling approach that enables robots to predict, adapt to, and control a wide array of challenging deformable materials with unknown physical properties. AdaptiGraph leverages the highly flexible graph-based neural dynamics (GBND) framework, which represents material bits as particles and employs a graph neural network (GNN) to predict particle motion. Its key innovation is a unified physical property-conditioned GBND model capable of predicting the motions of diverse materials with varying physical properties without retraining. Upon encountering new materials during online deployment, AdaptiGraph utilizes a physical property optimization process for a few-shot adaptation of the model, enhancing its fit to the observed interaction data. The adapted models can precisely simulate the dynamics and predict the motion of various deformable materials, such as ropes, granular media, rigid boxes, and cloth, while adapting to different physical properties, including stiffness, granular size, and center of pressure. On prediction and manipulation tasks involving a diverse set of real-world deformable objects, our method exhibits superior prediction accuracy and task proficiency over non-material-conditioned and non-adaptive models.

| **[Deep-Graph-Sprints: Accelerated Representation Learning in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07712v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) are essential for modeling interconnected, evolving systems. Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while improving inference speed up to 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our tested benchmarks. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Graph Neural Networks for Node Similarity on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07639v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental task for exploiting information in various applications dealing with graph data, such as citation networks or knowledge graphs. While this task has been intensively approached from heuristics to graph embeddings and graph neural networks (GNNs), providing explanations for similarity has received less attention. In this work we are concerned with explainable similarity search over graphs, by investigating how GNN-based methods for computing node similarities can be augmented with explanations. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two prominent approaches towards explanations in GNNs, based on the concepts of mutual information (MI), and gradient-based explanations (GB). We discuss their suitability and empirically validate the properties of their explanations over different popular graph benchmarks. We find that unlike MI explanations, gradient-based explanations have three desirable properties. First, they are actionable: selecting inputs depending on them results in predictable changes in similarity scores. Second, they are consistent: the effect of selecting certain inputs overlaps very little with the effect of discarding them. Third, they can be pruned significantly to obtain sparse explanations that retain the effect on similarity scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivector Neurons: Better and Faster O(n)-Equivariant Clifford Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04052v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current deep learning models equivariant to $O(n)$ or $SO(n)$ either consider mostly scalar information such as distances and angles or have a very high computational complexity. In this work, we test a few novel message passing graph neural networks (GNNs) based on Clifford multivectors, structured similarly to other prevalent equivariant models in geometric deep learning. Our approach leverages efficient invariant scalar features while simultaneously performing expressive learning on multivector representations, particularly through the use of the equivariant geometric product operator. By integrating these elements, our methods outperform established efficient baseline models on an N-Body simulation task and protein denoising task while maintaining a high efficiency. In particular, we push the state-of-the-art error on the N-body dataset to 0.0035 (averaged over 3 runs); an 8% improvement over recent methods. Our implementation is available on Github.</p></details> |  |

However, most approaches tend to make strong assumptions about the downstream task of interest, are reliant on hand-labeled data, or fail to equally balance the importance of both text and graph representations. In this work, we propose Contrastive Graph-Text pretraining (ConGraT), a general, self-supervised approach for jointly learning separate representations of texts and nodes in a TAG. Our method trains a language model (LM) and a graph neural network (GNN) to align their representations in a common latent space using a batch-wise contrastive learning objective inspired by CLIP. We further propose an extension to the CLIP objective that leverages graph structure to incorporate information about inter-node similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConGraT outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including node and text category classification, link prediction, and language modeling. Finally, we present an application of our method to community detection in social graphs, which enables finding more textually grounded communities, rather than purely graph-based ones.

LMAO provides an abstract framework for deploying distributed optimization and search algorithms within the Lava software framework. Moreover, LMAO introduces support for random and grid search along with process connections across multiple levels of mathematical precision. We evaluate the algorithmic performance of LMAO with a traditional non-convex optimization problem, a fixed-precision transductive spiking graph neural network for citation graph classification, and a neuromorphic satellite scheduling problem.

This problem is further exacerbated when the underlying topology of these networks is affected by individual highly-dimensional node attributes. We address this issue by tracking a network's modularity as a proxy of its community structure. We leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to estimate each snapshot's modularity. GNNs can account for both network structure and high-dimensional node attributes, providing a comprehensive approach for estimating network statistics. Our method is validated through simulations that demonstrate its ability to detect changes in highly-attributed networks by analyzing shifts in modularity. Moreover, we find our method is able to detect a real-world event within the \#Iran Twitter reply network, where each node has high-dimensional textual attributes.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods struggle to accurately capture true community structures and intra-cluster relations, be computationally efficient, and identify smaller communities. We address these challenges by integrating coarsening and modularity maximization, effectively leveraging both adjacency and node features to enhance clustering accuracy. We propose a loss function incorporating log-determinant, smoothness, and modularity components using a block majorization-minimization technique, resulting in superior clustering outcomes. The method is theoretically consistent under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DC-SBM), ensuring asymptotic error-free performance and complete label recovery. Our provably convergent and time-efficient algorithm seamlessly integrates with graph neural networks (GNNs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) to learn enhanced node features and deliver exceptional clustering performance.

Estimating and compensating for true anatomical motion during radiotherapy is essential for improving the delivery of planned radiation dose to target volumes while sparing organs-at-risk, and thereby improving the therapeutic ratio. Achieving this using only limited imaging available during irradiation and without the use of surrogate signals or invasive fiducial markers is attractive. The proposed model learns the mesh regression from a patient-specific template and deep features extracted from kV images at arbitrary projection angles. A 2D-CNN encoder extracts image features, and four feature pooling networks fuse these features to the 3D template organ mesh. A ResNet-based graph attention network then deforms the feature-encoded mesh. The model is trained using synthetically generated organ motion instances and corresponding kV images. The latter is generated by deforming a reference CT volume aligned with the template mesh, creating digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) at required projection angles, and DRR-to-kV style transferring with a conditional CycleGAN model. The overall framework was tested quantitatively on synthetic respiratory motion scenarios and qualitatively on in-treatment images acquired over full scan series for liver cancer patients. Overall mean prediction errors for synthetic motion test datasets were 0.16$\pm$0.13 mm, 0.18$\pm$0.19 mm, 0.22$\pm$0.34 mm, and 0.12$\pm$0.11 mm. Mean peak prediction errors were 1.39 mm, 1.99 mm, 3.29 mm, and 1.16 mm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph Pruning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11531v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of knowledge graph based recommendation system (KGRS), which enriches the representation of users, items, and entities by structural knowledge with striking improvement. Nevertheless, its unaffordable computational cost still limits researchers from exploring more sophisticated models. We observe that the bottleneck for training efficiency arises from the knowledge graph, which is plagued by the well-known issue of knowledge explosion. Recently, some works have attempted to slim the inflated KG via summarization techniques. However, these summarized nodes may ignore the collaborative signals and deviate from the facts that nodes in knowledge graph represent symbolic abstractions of entities from the real-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called KGTrimmer for knowledge graph pruning tailored for recommendation, to remove the unessential nodes while minimizing performance degradation. Specifically, we design an importance evaluator from a dual-view perspective. For the collective view, we embrace the idea of collective intelligence by extracting community consensus based on abundant collaborative signals, i.e. nodes are considered important if they attract attention of numerous users. For the holistic view, we learn a global mask to identify the valueless nodes from their inherent properties or overall popularity. Next, we build an end-to-end importance-aware graph neural network, which injects filtered knowledge to enhance the distillation of valuable user-item collaborative signals. Ultimately, we generate a pruned knowledge graph with lightweight, stable, and robust properties to facilitate the following-up recommendation task. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets to prove the effectiveness and generalization ability of KGTrimmer.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Limitation and Experience Replay for GNNs in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03534v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning seeks to empower models to progressively acquire information from a sequence of tasks. This approach is crucial for many real-world systems, which are dynamic and evolve over time. Recent research has witnessed a surge in the exploration of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in Node-wise Graph Continual Learning (NGCL), a practical yet challenging paradigm involving the continual training of a GNN on node-related tasks. Despite recent advancements in continual learning strategies for GNNs in NGCL, a thorough theoretical understanding, especially regarding its learnability, is lacking. Learnability concerns the existence of a learning algorithm that can produce a good candidate model from the hypothesis/weight space, which is crucial for model selection in NGCL development. This paper introduces the first theoretical exploration of the learnability of GNN in NGCL, revealing that learnability is heavily influenced by structural shifts due to the interconnected nature of graph data. Specifically, GNNs may not be viable for NGCL under significant structural changes, emphasizing the need to manage structural shifts. To mitigate the impact of structural shifts, we propose a novel experience replay method termed Structure-Evolution-Aware Experience Replay (SEA-ER). SEA-ER features an innovative experience selection strategy that capitalizes on the topological awareness of GNNs, alongside a unique replay strategy that employs structural alignment to effectively counter catastrophic forgetting and diminish the impact of structural shifts on GNNs in NGCL. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and the effectiveness of SEA-ER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Using GNN-CL Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06529v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The innovative GNN-CL model proposed in this paper marks a breakthrough in the field of financial fraud detection by synergistically combining the advantages of graph neural networks (gnn), convolutional neural networks (cnn) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This convergence enables multifaceted analysis of complex transaction patterns, improving detection accuracy and resilience against complex fraudulent activities. A key novelty of this paper is the use of multilayer perceptrons (MLPS) to estimate node similarity, effectively filtering out neighborhood noise that can lead to false positives. This intelligent purification mechanism ensures that only the most relevant information is considered, thereby improving the model's understanding of the network structure. Feature weakening often plagues graph-based models due to the dilution of key signals. In order to further address the challenge of feature weakening, GNN-CL adopts reinforcement learning strategies. By dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to central nodes, it reinforces the importance of these influential entities to retain important clues of fraud even in less informative data. Experimental evaluations on Yelp datasets show that the results highlight the superior performance of GNN-CL compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06518v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has attracted much attention due to its superior performance in coverage, latency, and throughput. Resource allocation within C-V2X is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety information and meeting the stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and high reliability in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper proposes a method that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address this challenge. By constructing a dynamic graph with communication links as nodes and employing the Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) model to adapt to changes in graph structure, the model aims to ensure a high success rate for V2V communication while minimizing interference on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links, thereby ensuring the successful transmission of V2V link information and maintaining high transmission rates for V2I links. The proposed method retains the global feature learning capabilities of GNN and supports distributed network deployment, allowing vehicles to extract low-dimensional features that include structural information from the graph network based on local observations and to make independent resource allocation decisions. Simulation results indicate that the introduction of GNN, with a modest increase in computational load, effectively enhances the decision-making quality of agents, demonstrating superiority to other methods. This study not only provides a theoretically efficient resource allocation strategy for V2V and V2I communications but also paves a new technical path for resource management in practical IoV environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures.

Nevertheless, they have been shown to be susceptible to backdoor poisoning attacks, which pose serious threats to real-world applications. Meanwhile, graph reduction techniques, including coarsening and sparsification, which have long been employed to improve the scalability of large graph computational tasks, have recently emerged as effective methods for accelerating GNN training on large-scale graphs. However, the current development and deployment of graph reduction techniques for large graphs overlook the potential risks of data poisoning attacks against GNNs. It is not yet clear how graph reduction interacts with existing backdoor attacks. This paper conducts a thorough examination of the robustness of graph reduction methods in scalable GNN training in the presence of state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. We performed a comprehensive robustness analysis across six coarsening methods and six sparsification methods for graph reduction, under three GNN backdoor attacks against three GNN architectures. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of graph reduction methods in mitigating attack success rates varies significantly, with some methods even exacerbating the attacks. Through detailed analyses of triggers and poisoned nodes, we interpret our findings and enhance our understanding of how graph reduction influences robustness against backdoor attacks. These results highlight the critical need for incorporating robustness considerations in graph reduction for GNN training, ensuring that enhancements in computational efficiency do not compromise the security of GNN systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Graph Neural Networks and Frequency Domain Data for Automated Operational Modal Analysis of Populations of Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06492v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Population-Based Structural Health Monitoring (PBSHM) paradigm has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance data-driven assessment of engineering structures by facilitating transfer learning between structures with some degree of similarity. In this work, we apply this concept to the automated modal identification of structural systems. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based deep learning scheme to identify modal properties, including natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of engineering structures based on the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of spatially-sparse vibration measurements. Systematic numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed model, employing two distinct truss populations that possess similar topological characteristics but varying geometric (size, shape) and material (stiffness) properties. The results demonstrate that, once trained, the proposed GNN-based model can identify modal properties of unseen structures within the same structural population with good efficiency and acceptable accuracy, even in the presence of measurement noise and sparse measurement locations. The GNN-based model exhibits advantages over the classic Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) method in terms of identification speed, as well as against an alternate Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture in terms of identification accuracy, rendering this a promising tool for PBSHM purposes.</p></details> |  |
| **[P3GNN: A Privacy-Preserving Provenance Graph-Based Model for APT Detection in Software Defined Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12003v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Defined Networking (SDN) has brought significant advancements in network management and programmability. However, this evolution has also heightened vulnerability to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), sophisticated and stealthy cyberattacks that traditional detection methods often fail to counter, especially in the face of zero-day exploits. A prevalent issue is the inadequacy of existing strategies to detect novel threats while addressing data privacy concerns in collaborative learning scenarios. This paper presents P3GNN (privacy-preserving provenance graph-based graph neural network model), a novel model that synergizes Federated Learning (FL) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for effective APT detection in SDN environments. P3GNN utilizes unsupervised learning to analyze operational patterns within provenance graphs, identifying deviations indicative of security breaches. Its core feature is the integration of FL with homomorphic encryption, which fortifies data confidentiality and gradient integrity during collaborative learning. This approach addresses the critical challenge of data privacy in shared learning contexts. Key innovations of P3GNN include its ability to detect anomalies at the node level within provenance graphs, offering a detailed view of attack trajectories and enhancing security analysis. Furthermore, the models unsupervised learning capability enables it to identify zero-day attacks by learning standard operational patterns. Empirical evaluation using the DARPA TCE3 dataset demonstrates P3GNNs exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.93 and a low false positive rate of 0.06.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs using Path-based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10293v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a crucial research area in knowledge graphs, with many downstream applications. In many real-world scenarios, inductive link prediction is required, where predictions have to be made among unseen entities. Embedding-based models usually need fine-tuning on new entity embeddings, and hence are difficult to be directly applied to inductive link prediction tasks. Logical rules captured by rule-based models can be directly applied to new entities with the same graph typologies, but the captured rules are discrete and usually lack generosity. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can generalize topological information to new graphs taking advantage of deep neural networks, which however may still need fine-tuning on new entity embeddings. In this paper, we propose SiaILP, a path-based model for inductive link prediction using siamese neural networks. Our model only depends on relation and path embeddings, which can be generalized to new entities without fine-tuning. Experiments show that our model achieves several new state-of-the-art performances in link prediction tasks using inductive versions of WN18RR, FB15k-237, and Nell995. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/canlinzhang/SiaILP}.</p></details> |  |

Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily relying on electroencephalograms (EEGs), often result in cumbersome and non-portable solutions, making continuous patient monitoring challenging. The video-based seizure detection system is expected to free patients from the constraints of scalp or implanted EEG devices and enable remote monitoring in residential settings. Previous video-based methods neither enable all-day monitoring nor provide short detection latency due to insufficient resources and ineffective patient action recognition techniques. Additionally, skeleton-based action recognition approaches remain limitations in identifying subtle seizure-related actions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Video-based Seizure detection model via a skeleton-based spatiotemporal Vision Graph neural network (VSViG) for its efficient, accurate and timely purpose in real-time scenarios. Our experimental results indicate VSViG outperforms previous state-of-the-art action recognition models on our collected patients' video data with higher accuracy (5.9% error), lower FLOPs (0.4G), and smaller model size (1.4M). Furthermore, by integrating a decision-making rule that combines output probabilities and an accumulative function, we achieve a 5.1 s detection latency after EEG onset, a 13.1 s detection advance before clinical onset, and a zero false detection rate.

Being able to infer collective cell migratory dynamics from their static configuration is valuable for both understanding and predicting these complex processes. However, the identification of structural features that can indicate multicellular motion has been difficult, and existing metrics largely rely on physical instincts.

However, existing CNN approaches are generally repurposed semantic segmentation architectures and suffer from the poor delineation of long and curved regions. Lack of overall road topology and structure information further deteriorates their performance on challenging remote sensing images. This paper presents a novel multi-task graph neural network (GNN) which simultaneously detects both road regions and road borders; the inter-play between these two tasks unlocks superior performance from two perspectives: (1) the hierarchically detected road borders enable the network to capture and encode holistic road structure to enhance road connectivity (2) identifying the intrinsic correlation of semantic landcover regions mitigates the difficulty in recognizing roads cluttered by regions with similar appearance. Experiments on challenging dataset demonstrate that the proposed architecture can improve the road border delineation and road extraction accuracy compared with the existing methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Completeness of Invariant Geometric Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04836v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models. We first rigorously bound the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then show that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks (subgraph GNNs), can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the theoretical power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities. We also empirically evaluated GeoNGNN, the simplest model within the large E(3)-complete family we established, which achieves competitive results to models relying on high-order invariant/equivariant representations on molecule-relevant tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Graph-Based Fraud Detection in Sight of Heterophily and Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06441v3)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based fraud detection (GFD) can be regarded as a challenging semi-supervised node binary classification task. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been widely applied to GFD, characterizing the anomalous possibility of a node by aggregating neighbor information. However, fraud graphs are inherently heterophilic, thus most of GNNs perform poorly due to their assumption of homophily. In addition, due to the existence of heterophily and class imbalance problem, the existing models do not fully utilize the precious node label information. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a semi-supervised GNN-based fraud detector SEC-GFD. This detector includes a hybrid filtering module and a local environmental constraint module, the two modules are utilized to solve heterophily and label utilization problem respectively. The first module starts from the perspective of the spectral domain, and solves the heterophily problem to a certain extent. Specifically, it divides the spectrum into various mixed-frequency bands based on the correlation between spectrum energy distribution and heterophily. Then in order to make full use of the node label information, a local environmental constraint module is adaptively designed. The comprehensive experimental results on four real-world fraud detection datasets denote that SEC-GFD outperforms other competitive graph-based fraud detectors. We release our code at https://github.com/Sunxkissed/SEC-GFD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Attention with Random Rewiring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05649v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become fundamental in graph-structured deep learning. Key paradigms of modern GNNs include message passing, graph rewiring, and Graph Transformers. This paper introduces Graph-Rewiring Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture that combines the advantages of these three paradigms. GRASS rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph, enhancing long-range information propagation while preserving structural features of the input graph. It also employs a unique additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data, providing a graph inductive bias while remaining computationally efficient. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, confirming its practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Our method applies a successive shortest paths (SSP) algorithm to a tracking graph defined over a batch of frames. The edge costs in this tracking graph are computed via a message-passing network, a graph neural network (GNN) variant. The parameters of the GNN, and hence, the tracker, are learned end-to-end on a training set of example ground-truth tracks and detections. Specifically, learning takes the form of bilevel optimization guided by our novel loss function. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated scenarios to understand its sensitivity to scenario aspects and model hyperparameters. Across varied scenario complexities, our method compares favorably to a strong baseline.</p></details> |  |

To explore the complexity, we introduce the MEEG dataset, a comprehensive multi-modal music-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset and the Attention-based Temporal Learner with Dynamic Graph Neural Network (AT-DGNN), a novel framework for EEG-based emotion recognition. The MEEG dataset captures a wide range of emotional responses to music, enabling an in-depth analysis of brainwave patterns in musical contexts. The AT-DGNN combines an attention-based temporal learner with a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) to accurately model the local and global graph dynamics of EEG data across varying brain network topology. Our evaluations show that AT-DGNN achieves superior performance, with an accuracy (ACC) of 83.06\% in arousal and 85.31\% in valence, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the MEEG dataset. Comparative analyses with traditional datasets like DEAP highlight the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the potential of music as a powerful medium for emotion induction. This study not only advances our understanding of the brain emotional processing, but also enhances the accuracy of emotion recognition technologies in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), leveraging both graph-based learning and the emotional impact of music.

SPH is a class of Lagrangian schemes that discretize fluid dynamics via finite material points that are tracked through the evolving velocity field. Due to the particle-like nature of the simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as appealing and successful surrogates. However, the practical utility of such GNN-based simulators relies on their ability to faithfully model physics, providing accurate and stable predictions over long time horizons - which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we identify particle clustering originating from tensile instabilities as one of the primary pitfalls. Based on these insights, we enhance both training and rollout inference of state-of-the-art GNN-based simulators with varying components from standard SPH solvers, including pressure, viscous, and external force components. All Neural SPH-enhanced simulators achieve better performance than the baseline GNNs, often by orders of magnitude in terms of rollout error, allowing for significantly longer rollouts and significantly better physics modeling.

Open ad hoc teamwork (OAHT) further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. One promising solution in practice to this problem is leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks to handle an unrestricted number of agents with various agent-types, named graph-based policy learning (GPL). However, its joint Q-value representation over a coordination graph lacks convincing explanations. In this paper, we establish a new theory to understand the representation of the joint Q-value for OAHT and its learning paradigm, through the lens of cooperative game theory. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm named CIAO, based on GPL's framework, with additional provable implementation tricks that can facilitate learning.

| **[PICA: Physics-Integrated Clothed Avatar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05324v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PICA, a novel representation for high-fidelity animatable clothed human avatars with physics-accurate dynamics, even for loose clothing. Previous neural rendering-based representations of animatable clothed humans typically employ a single model to represent both the clothing and the underlying body. While efficient, these approaches often fail to accurately represent complex garment dynamics, leading to incorrect deformations and noticeable rendering artifacts, especially for sliding or loose garments. Furthermore, previous works represent garment dynamics as pose-dependent deformations and facilitate novel pose animations in a data-driven manner. This often results in outcomes that do not faithfully represent the mechanics of motion and are prone to generating artifacts in out-of-distribution poses. To address these issues, we adopt two individual 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models with different deformation characteristics, modeling the human body and clothing separately. This distinction allows for better handling of their respective motion characteristics. With this representation, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN)-based clothed body physics simulation module to ensure an accurate representation of clothing dynamics. Our method, through its carefully designed features, achieves high-fidelity rendering of clothed human bodies in complex and novel driving poses, significantly outperforming previous methods under the same settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ustc3dv.github.io/PICA/</p></details> |
| **[Vulnerability-Hunter: An Adaptive Feature Perception Attention Network for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05318v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection (SCVD) is crucial to guarantee the quality of blockchain-based systems. Graph neural networks have been shown to be effective in learning semantic representations of smart contract code and are commonly adopted by existing deep learning-based SCVD. However, the current methods still have limitations in their utilization of graph sampling or subgraph pooling based on predefined rules for extracting crucial components from structure graphs of smart contract code. These predefined rule-based strategies, typically designed using static rules or heuristics, demonstrate limited adaptability to dynamically adjust extraction strategies according to the structure and content of the graph in heterogeneous topologies of smart contract code. Consequently, these strategies may not possess universal applicability to all smart contracts, potentially leading to false positives or omissions. To address these problems, we propose AFPNet, a novel vulnerability detection model equipped with a feature perception module that has dynamic weights for comprehensive scanning of the entire smart contract code and automatic extraction of crucial code snippets (the $P$ snippets with the largest weights). Subsequently, the relationship perception attention module employs an attention mechanism to learn dependencies among these code snippets and detect smart contract vulnerabilities. The efforts made by AFPNet consistently enable the capture of crucial code snippets and enhance the performance of SCVD optimization. We conduct an evaluation of AFPNet in the several large-scale datasets with vulnerability labels. The experimental results show that our AFPNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 6.38\%-14.02\% in term of F1-score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AFPNet in dynamically extracting valuable information and vulnerability detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flexible, Equivariant Framework for Subgraph GNNs via Graph Products and Graph Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09291v2)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph Graph Neural Networks (Subgraph GNNs) enhance the expressivity of message-passing GNNs by representing graphs as sets of subgraphs. They have shown impressive performance on several tasks, but their complexity limits applications to larger graphs. Previous approaches suggested processing only subsets of subgraphs, selected either randomly or via learnable sampling. However, they make suboptimal subgraph selections or can only cope with very small subset sizes, inevitably incurring performance degradation. This paper introduces a new Subgraph GNNs framework to address these issues. We employ a graph coarsening function to cluster nodes into super-nodes with induced connectivity. The product between the coarsened and the original graph reveals an implicit structure whereby subgraphs are associated with specific sets of nodes. By running generalized message-passing on such graph product, our method effectively implements an efficient, yet powerful Subgraph GNN. Controlling the coarsening function enables meaningful selection of any number of subgraphs while, contrary to previous methods, being fully compatible with standard training techniques. Notably, we discover that the resulting node feature tensor exhibits new, unexplored permutation symmetries. We leverage this structure, characterize the associated linear equivariant layers and incorporate them into the layers of our Subgraph GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple graph learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, as it can seamlessly handle any number of subgraphs, while consistently outperforming baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

To help machines leverage such knowledge, existing solutions can be categorized into two groups. Some focus on implicitly modeling eventuality knowledge by pretraining language models (LMs) with eventuality-aware objectives. However, this approach breaks down knowledge structures and lacks interpretability. Others explicitly collect world knowledge of eventualities into structured eventuality-centric knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing research on leveraging these knowledge sources for free-texts is limited. In this work, we propose an initial comprehensive framework called EventGround, which aims to tackle the problem of grounding free-texts to eventuality-centric KGs for contextualized narrative reasoning. We identify two critical problems in this direction: the event representation and sparsity problems. We provide simple yet effective parsing and partial information extraction methods to tackle these problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models when combined with graph neural network (GNN) or large language model (LLM) based graph reasoning models. Our framework, incorporating grounded knowledge, achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalized Transformer-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Framework in 5G RANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05197v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio link failure (RLF) prediction system in Radio Access Networks (RANs) is critical for ensuring seamless communication and meeting the stringent requirements of high data rates, low latency, and improved reliability in 5G networks. However, weather conditions such as precipitation, humidity, temperature, and wind impact these communication links. Usually, historical radio link Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their surrounding weather station observations are utilized for building learning-based RLF prediction models. However, such models must be capable of learning the spatial weather context in a dynamic RAN and effectively encoding time series KPIs with the weather observation data. Existing works fail to incorporate both of these essential design aspects of the prediction models. This paper fills the gap by proposing GenTrap, a novel RLF prediction framework that introduces a graph neural network (GNN)-based learnable weather effect aggregation module and employs state-of-the-art time series transformer as the temporal feature extractor for radio link failure prediction. The proposed aggregation method of GenTrap can be integrated into any existing prediction model to achieve better performance and generalizability. We evaluate GenTrap on two real-world datasets (rural and urban) with 2.6 million KPI data points and show that GenTrap offers a significantly higher F1-score (0.93 for rural and 0.79 for urban) compared to its counterparts while possessing generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCON: Differentially Private Graph Convolutional Network via Objective Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05034v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a popular machine learning model with a wide range of applications in graph analytics, including healthcare, transportation, and finance. Similar to other neural networks, a GCN may memorize parts of the training data through its model weights. Thus, when the underlying graph data contains sensitive information such as interpersonal relationships, a GCN trained without privacy-protection measures could be exploited to extract private data, leading to potential violations of privacy regulations such as GDPR. To defend against such attacks, a promising approach is to train the GCN with differential privacy (DP), which is a rigorous framework that provides strong privacy protection by injecting random noise into the trained model weights. However, training a large graph neural network under DP is a highly challenging task. Existing solutions either introduce random perturbations in the graph topology, which leads to severe distortions of the network's message passing, or inject randomness into each neighborhood aggregation operation, which leads to a high noise scale when the GCN performs multiple levels of aggregations. Motivated by this, we propose GCON, a novel and effective solution for training GCNs with edge differential privacy. The main idea is to (i) convert the GCN training process into a convex optimization problem, and then (ii) apply the classic idea of perturbing the objective function to satisfy DP. Extensive experiments using multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate GCON's consistent and superior performance over existing solutions in a wide variety of settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Effectiveness of Graph Classification Datasets in Benchmarks for Assessing GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04999v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph classification benchmarks, vital for assessing and developing graph neural networks (GNNs), have recently been scrutinized, as simple methods like MLPs have demonstrated comparable performance. This leads to an important question: Do these benchmarks effectively distinguish the advancements of GNNs over other methodologies? If so, how do we quantitatively measure this effectiveness? In response, we first propose an empirical protocol based on a fair benchmarking framework to investigate the performance discrepancy between simple methods and GNNs. We further propose a novel metric to quantify the dataset effectiveness by considering both dataset complexity and model performance. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to thoroughly study and provide an explicit definition for dataset effectiveness in the graph learning area. Through testing across 16 real-world datasets, we found our metric to align with existing studies and intuitive assumptions. Finally, we explore the causes behind the low effectiveness of certain datasets by investigating the correlation between intrinsic graph properties and class labels, and we developed a novel technique supporting the correlation-controllable synthetic dataset generation. Our findings shed light on the current understanding of benchmark datasets, and our new platform could fuel the future evolution of graph classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, similar to deep neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Empirical studies have shown that adversarially robust generalization has a pivotal role in establishing effective defense algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we contribute by providing adversarially robust generalization bounds for two kinds of popular GNNs, graph convolutional network (GCN) and message passing graph neural network, using the PAC-Bayesian framework. Our result reveals that spectral norm of the diffusion matrix on the graph and spectral norm of the weights as well as the perturbation factor govern the robust generalization bounds of both models. Our bounds are nontrivial generalizations of the results developed in (Liao et al., 2020) from the standard setting to adversarial setting while avoiding exponential dependence of the maximum node degree. As corollaries, we derive better PAC-Bayesian robust generalization bounds for GCN in the standard setting, which improve the bounds in (Liao et al., 2020) by avoiding exponential dependence on the maximum node degree.</p></details> | 38pages |

It operates by establishing channels between users, where Bitcoin is locked and transactions are conducted off-chain until the channels are closed, with only the initial and final transactions recorded on the blockchain. Routing transactions through intermediary nodes is crucial for users without direct channels, allowing these routing nodes to collect fees for their services. Nodes announce their channels to the network, forming a graph with channels as edges. In this paper, we analyze the graph structure of the Lightning Network and investigate the statistical relationships between node properties using machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We formulate a series of tasks to explore these relationships and provide benchmarks for GNN architectures, demonstrating how topological and neighbor information enhances performance. Our evaluation of several models reveals the effectiveness of GNNs in these tasks and highlights the insights gained from their application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Theory and GNNs to Unravel the Topographical Organization of Brain Lesions in Variants of Alzheimer's Disease Progression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00636v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we proposed and evaluated a graph-based framework to assess variations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologies, focusing on classic (cAD) and rapid (rpAD) progression forms. Histopathological images are converted into tau-pathology-based (i.e., amyloid plaques and tau tangles) graphs, and derived metrics are used in a machine-learning classifier. This classifier incorporates SHAP value explainability to differentiate between cAD and rpAD. Furthermore, we tested graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract topological embeddings from the graphs and use them in classifying the progression forms of AD. The analysis demonstrated denser networks in rpAD and a distinctive impact on brain cortical layers: rpAD predominantly affects middle layers, whereas cAD influences both superficial and deep layers of the same cortical regions. These results suggest a unique neuropathological network organization for each AD variant.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-Adaptive mesh refinement -- leveraging graph neural networks and differentiable finite element solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04516v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel, and effective, approach to the long-standing problem of mesh adaptivity in finite element methods (FEM). FE solvers are powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their cost and accuracy are critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. To keep computational costs low, mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the position of a fixed number of mesh points to obtain the best FE solution accuracy. Classical approaches to this problem require the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to find the mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing and relies on certain a-priori assumptions and guiding heuristics for optimal mesh point location. Recent machine learning approaches to r-adaptivity have mainly focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Our new approach combines a graph neural network (GNN) powered architecture, with training based on direct minimisation of the FE solution error with respect to the mesh point locations. The GNN employs graph neural diffusion (GRAND), closely aligning the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing heuristics with a learnable strategy, and providing a strong inductive bias. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. This method outperforms classical and prior ML approaches to r-adaptive meshing on the test problems we consider, in particular achieving lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we bring the coverage of methods up to 2023, including corpus-level and document-level graph neural networks. We discuss each of these methods in detail, dealing with the graph construction mechanisms and the graph-based learning process. As well as the technological survey, we look at issues behind and future directions addressed in text classification using graph neural networks.

Traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle both the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field is to combine graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatio-temporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Benchmark experiments using several statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatio-temporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models on three different real-world traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble data-driven method can handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make long-term forecasts in an efficient manner.</p></details> |  |

This paper unveils ScenarioFuzz, a pioneering scenario-based fuzz testing methodology. Designed like a choreographer who understands the past performances, it uncovers vulnerabilities in ADS without the crutch of predefined scenarios. Leveraging map road networks, such as OPENDRIVE, we extract essential data to form a foundational scenario seed corpus. This corpus, enriched with pertinent information, provides the necessary boundaries for fuzz testing in the absence of starting scenarios. Our approach integrates specialized mutators and mutation techniques, combined with a graph neural network model, to predict and filter out high-risk scenario seeds, optimizing the fuzzing process using historical test data. Compared to other methods, our approach reduces the time cost by an average of 60.3%, while the number of error scenarios discovered per unit of time increases by 103%. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised collision trajectory clustering method, which aids in identifying and summarizing 54 high-risk scenario categories prone to inducing ADS faults. Our experiments have successfully uncovered 58 bugs across six tested systems, emphasizing the critical safety concerns of ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by 33rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2024)</p></details> |

These devices offer novel pathways for disease diagnostics, treatment, and monitoring within the bloodstreams. Ensuring precise localization of events of diagnostic interest, which underpins the concept of flow-guided in-body nanoscale localization, would provide an added diagnostic value to the detected events. Raw data generated by the nanodevices is pivotal for this localization and consist of an event detection indicator and the time elapsed since the last passage of a nanodevice through the heart. The energy constraints of the nanodevices lead to intermittent operation and unreliable communication, intrinsically affecting this data. This posits a need for comprehensively modelling the features of this data. These imperfections also have profound implications for the viability of existing flow-guided localization approaches, which are ill-prepared to address the intricacies of the environment. Our first contribution lies in an analytical model of raw data for flow-guided localization, dissecting how communication and energy capabilities influence the nanodevices' data output. This model acts as a vital bridge, reconciling idealized assumptions with practical challenges of flow-guided localization. Toward addressing these practical challenges, we also present an integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into the flow-guided localization paradigm. GNNs excel in capturing complex dynamic interactions inherent to the localization of events sensed by the nanodevices. Our results highlight the potential of GNNs not only to enhance localization accuracy but also extend coverage to encompass the entire bloodstream.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables, 45 references</p></details> |
| **[Graph Pooling via Ricci Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04236v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Machine Learning often involves the clustering of nodes based on similarity structure encoded in the graph's topology and the nodes' attributes. On homophilous graphs, the integration of pooling layers has been shown to enhance the performance of Graph Neural Networks by accounting for inherent multi-scale structure. Here, similar nodes are grouped together to coarsen the graph and reduce the input size in subsequent layers in deeper architectures. In both settings, the underlying clustering approach can be implemented via graph pooling operators, which often rely on classical tools from Graph Theory. In this work, we introduce a graph pooling operator (ORC-Pool), which utilizes a characterization of the graph's geometry via Ollivier's discrete Ricci curvature and an associated geometric flow. Previous Ricci flow based clustering approaches have shown great promise across several domains, but are by construction unable to account for similarity structure encoded in the node attributes. However, in many ML applications, such information is vital for downstream tasks. ORC-Pool extends such clustering approaches to attributed graphs, allowing for the integration of geometric coarsening into Graph Neural Networks as a pooling layer.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

Recently developed methods, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, demonstrate exceptional performance across various datasets by effectively extracting structural information. However, the benchmarking of these novel methods often varies significantly in terms of hyperparameter settings and datasets, which limits algorithmic progress. In view of these, we conduct a comprehensive survey and benchmark for drug-target interaction modeling from a structure perspective, via integrating tens of explicit (i.e., GNN-based) and implicit (i.e., Transformer-based) structure learning algorithms. To this end, we first unify the hyperparameter setting within each class of structure learning methods. Moreover, we conduct a macroscopical comparison between these two classes of encoding strategies as well as the different featurization techniques that inform molecules' chemical and physical properties. We then carry out the microscopical comparison between all the integrated models across the six datasets, via comprehensively benchmarking their effectiveness and efficiency. Remarkably, the summarized insights from the benchmark studies lead to the design of model combos. We demonstrate that our combos can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on various datasets associated with cost-effective memory and computation.

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

To address this gap, we investigate the importance of different meta-paths and introduce an automatic framework for utilizing long-range dependency on heterogeneous graphs, denoted as Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). Specifically, we develop a search space with all meta-paths related to the target node type. By employing a progressive sampling algorithm, LMSPS dynamically shrinks the search space with hop-independent time complexity. Through a sampling evaluation strategy, LMSPS conducts a specialized and effective meta-path selection, leading to retraining with only effective meta-paths, thus mitigating costs and over-smoothing. Extensive experiments across diverse heterogeneous datasets validate LMSPS's capability in discovering effective long-range meta-paths, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

However, many models either use graph neural networks (GNN) to construct single-level brain functional networks (BFNs) or employ spatial convolution filtering for local information extraction from rs-fMRI data, often neglecting high-order features crucial for NDD classification. Methods: We introduce a Multi-view High-order Network (MHNet) to capture hierarchical and high-order features from multi-view BFNs derived from rs-fMRI data for NDD prediction. MHNet has two branches: the Euclidean Space Features Extraction (ESFE) module and the Non-Euclidean Space Features Extraction (Non-ESFE) module, followed by a Feature Fusion-based Classification (FFC) module for NDD identification. ESFE includes a Functional Connectivity Generation (FCG) module and a High-order Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) module to extract local and high-order features from BFNs in Euclidean space. Non-ESFE comprises a Generic Internet-like Brain Hierarchical Network Generation (G-IBHN-G) module and a High-order Graph Neural Network (HGNN) module to capture topological and high-order features in non-Euclidean space. Results: Experiments on three public datasets show that MHNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods using both AAL1 and Brainnetome Atlas templates. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of MHNet and the effectiveness of using multi-view fMRI information and high-order features. Our study also offers atlas options for constructing more sophisticated hierarchical networks and explains the association between key brain regions and NDD. Conclusion: MHNet leverages multi-view feature learning from both Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces, incorporating high-order information from BFNs to enhance NDD classification performance.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Although GNNs are evaluated with ranking-based metrics, e.g NDCG@k and Recall@k, they remain largely trained with proxy losses, e.g the BPR loss. In this work we explore the use of ranking loss functions to directly optimize the evaluation metrics, an area not extensively investigated in the GNN community for collaborative filtering. We take advantage of smooth approximations of the rank to facilitate end-to-end training of GNNs and propose a Personalized PageRank-based negative sampling strategy tailored for ranking loss functions. Moreover, we extend the evaluation of GNN models for top-k recommendation tasks with an inductive user-centric protocol, providing a more accurate reflection of real-world applications. Our proposed method significantly outperforms the standard BPR loss and more advanced losses across four datasets and four recent GNN architectures while also exhibiting faster training. Demonstrating the potential of ranking loss functions in improving GNN training for collaborative filtering tasks.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we use adversarial robustness as a tool to uncover a significant gap between their theoretically possible and empirically achieved expressive power. To do so, we focus on the ability of GNNs to count specific subgraph patterns, which is an established measure of expressivity, and extend the concept of adversarial robustness to this task. Based on this, we develop efficient adversarial attacks for subgraph counting and show that more powerful GNNs fail to generalize even to small perturbations to the graph's structure. Expanding on this, we show that such architectures also fail to count substructures on out-of-distribution graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ${2}^{nd}$ AdvML Frontiers workshop at ${40}^{th}$ International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)</p></details> |
| **[One Fits All: Learning Fair Graph Neural Networks for Various Sensitive Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13544v2)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have highlighted fairness issues in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where they produce discriminatory predictions against specific protected groups categorized by sensitive attributes such as race and age. While various efforts to enhance GNN fairness have made significant progress, these approaches are often tailored to specific sensitive attributes. Consequently, they necessitate retraining the model from scratch to accommodate changes in the sensitive attribute requirement, resulting in high computational costs. To gain deeper insights into this issue, we approach the graph fairness problem from a causal modeling perspective, where we identify the confounding effect induced by the sensitive attribute as the underlying reason. Motivated by this observation, we formulate the fairness problem in graphs from an invariant learning perspective, which aims to learn invariant representations across environments. Accordingly, we propose a graph fairness framework based on invariant learning, namely FairINV, which enables the training of fair GNNs to accommodate various sensitive attributes within a single training session. Specifically, FairINV incorporates sensitive attribute partition and trains fair GNNs by eliminating spurious correlations between the label and various sensitive attributes. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that FairINV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fairness approaches, underscoring its effectiveness.

It achieved excellent performance in representation learning of multiple types of graphs such as homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and more complex graphs like knowledge graphs. However, merely stacking GNN layers may not improve the model's performance and can even be detrimental. For the phenomenon of performance degradation in deep GNNs, we propose a new perspective. Unlike the popular explanations of over-smoothing or over-squashing, we think the issue arises from the interference of low-quality node representations during message propagation. We introduce a simple and general method, SF-GNN, to address this problem. In SF-GNN, we define two representations for each node, one is the node representation that represents the feature of the node itself, and the other is the message representation specifically for propagating messages to neighbor nodes. A self-filter module evaluates the quality of the node representation and decides whether to integrate it into the message propagation based on this quality assessment. Experiments on node classification tasks for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, as well as link prediction tasks on knowledge graphs, demonstrate that our method can be applied to various GNN models and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in addressing deep GNN degradation.</p></details> |  |

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

By employing Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), Multi-Peptide aligns embeddings from both modalities into a shared latent space, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy. Evaluations on hemolysis and nonfouling datasets demonstrate Multi-Peptide's robustness, achieving state-of-the-art 86.185% accuracy in hemolysis prediction.

| **[Structure-Aware Consensus Network on Graphs with Few Labeled Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02188v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node classification with few labeled nodes presents significant challenges due to limited supervision. Conventional methods often exploit the graph in a transductive learning manner. They fail to effectively utilize the abundant unlabeled data and the structural information inherent in graphs. To address these issues, we introduce a Structure-Aware Consensus Network (SACN) from three perspectives. Firstly, SACN leverages a novel structure-aware consensus learning strategy between two strongly augmented views. The proposed strategy can fully exploit the potentially useful information of the unlabeled nodes and the structural information of the entire graph. Secondly, SACN uniquely integrates the graph's structural information to achieve strong-to-strong consensus learning, improving the utilization of unlabeled data while maintaining multiview learning. Thirdly, unlike two-branch graph neural network-based methods, SACN is designed for multiview feature learning within a single-branch architecture. Furthermore, a class-aware pseudolabel selection strategy helps address class imbalance and achieve effective weak-to-strong supervision. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate SACN's superior performance in node classification tasks, particularly at very low label rates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational simplicity.The source code is available at https://github.com/kunzhan/SACN</p></details> | under review |

However, when detecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be averaged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less distinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised Counterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which introduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to identify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For each identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model to translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous ones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood aggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through aggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations become more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly outperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53% on AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems(TCSS).

Urban region representation learning emerges as a crucial realm for fulfilling this task. Among deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, given that city elements can be naturally represented as nodes with various connections between them as edges. However, many existing GNN approaches encounter challenges such as over-smoothing and limitations in capturing information from nodes in other regions, resulting in the loss of crucial urban information and a decline in region representation performance. To address these challenges, we leverage urban graph structure information and introduce a hierarchical graph pooling process called Coarsened Graph Attention Pooling (CGAP). CGAP features local attention units to create coarsened intermediate graphs and global features. Additionally, by incorporating urban region graphs and global features into a global attention layer, we harness relational information to enhance representation effectiveness. Furthermore, CGAP integrates region attributes such as Points of Interest (POIs) and inter-regional contexts like human mobility, enabling the exploitation of multi-modal urban data for more comprehensive representation learning. Experiments on three downstream tasks related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals validate the effectiveness of region representations learned by our approach. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that CGAP excels in various socioeconomic prediction tasks compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods only rely on traditional graph neural networks to explore pairwise relationships but such kind of pairwise edges are not enough to describe multifaceted relationships involving anomaly. There is an emergency need to exploit node group information which plays a crucial role in UGAD. In addition, most previous works ignore the global underlying properties (e.g., hierarchy and power-law structure) which are common in real-world graph datasets and therefore are indispensable factors on UGAD task. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (HC-GLAD in short). To exploit node group connections, we construct hypergraphs based on gold motifs and subsequently perform hypergraph convolution. Furthermore, to preserve the hierarchy of real-world graphs, we introduce hyperbolic geometry into this field and conduct both graph and hypergraph embedding learning in hyperbolic space with hyperboloid model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously apply hypergraph with node group connections and hyperbolic geometry into this field. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets of different fields demonstrate the superiority of HC-GLAD on UGAD task.

Stemmed from the node-wise representations of GNNs, existing explanation studies have embraced the subgraph-specific viewpoint that attributes the decision results to the salient features and local structures of nodes. However, graph-level tasks necessitate long-range dependencies and global interactions for advanced GNNs, deviating significantly from subgraph-specific explanations. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel intrinsically interpretable scheme for graph classification, termed as Global Interactive Pattern (GIP) learning, which introduces learnable global interactive patterns to explicitly interpret decisions. GIP first tackles the complexity of interpretation by clustering numerous nodes using a constrained graph clustering module. Then, it matches the coarsened global interactive instance with a batch of self-interpretable graph prototypes, thereby facilitating a transparent graph-level reasoning process. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GIP yields significantly superior interpretability and competitive performance to~the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | Accepted in KDD2024 |

Graph-structured data often lacks the same scale as unstructured data, making the development of graph foundation models challenging. In this work, we propose Foundation-Informed Message Passing (FIMP), a Graph Neural Network (GNN) message-passing framework that leverages pretrained non-textual foundation models in graph-based tasks. We show that the self-attention layers of foundation models can effectively be repurposed on graphs to perform cross-node attention-based message-passing. Our model is evaluated on a real-world image network dataset and two biological applications (single-cell RNA sequencing data and fMRI brain activity recordings) in both finetuned and zero-shot settings. FIMP outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that it can effectively leverage state-of-the-art foundation models in graph tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (12 + 4 pages appendix). 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

Traditional RSMT algorithms spend a significant amount of time on finding Steiner points to reduce the total wire length or use heuristics to approximate producing sub-optimal results. We show that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be used to predict optimal Steiner points in RSMTs with high accuracy and can be parallelized on GPUs. In this paper, we propose GAT-Steiner, a graph attention network model that correctly predicts 99.846% of the nets in the ISPD19 benchmark with an average increase in wire length of only 0.480% on suboptimal wire length nets. On randomly generated benchmarks, GAT-Steiner correctly predicts 99.942% with an average increase in wire length of only 0.420% on suboptimal wire length nets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for The 2024 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD 2024)</p></details> |

We introduce an approach that combines visual and tactile sensing for robotic manipulation by learning a neural, tactile-informed dynamics model. Our proposed framework, RoboPack, employs a recurrent graph neural network to estimate object states, including particles and object-level latent physics information, from historical visuo-tactile observations and to perform future state predictions. Our tactile-informed dynamics model, learned from real-world data, can solve downstream robotics tasks with model-predictive control. We demonstrate our approach on a real robot equipped with a compliant Soft-Bubble tactile sensor on non-prehensile manipulation and dense packing tasks, where the robot must infer the physics properties of objects from direct and indirect interactions. Trained on only an average of 30 minutes of real-world interaction data per task, our model can perform online adaptation and make touch-informed predictions. Through extensive evaluations in both long-horizon dynamics prediction and real-world manipulation, our method demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to previous learning-based and physics-based simulation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Robot...</summary><p>Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS), 2024.

| **[Optimizing Age of Information in Vehicular Edge Computing with Federated Graph Neural Network Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02342v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), the sensors such as cameras and LiDAR installed on intelligent vehicles provides higher capacity of executing computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks, thereby raising deployment costs. To address this issue, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been proposed to process data through Road Side Units (RSUs) to support real-time applications. This paper focuses on the Age of Information (AoI) as a key metric for data freshness and explores task offloading issues for vehicles under RSU communication resource constraints. We adopt a Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach, allowing vehicles to autonomously make optimal data offloading decisions. However, MADRL poses risks of vehicle information leakage during communication learning and centralized training. To mitigate this, we employ a Federated Learning (FL) framework that shares model parameters instead of raw data to protect the privacy of vehicle users. Building on this, we propose an innovative distributed federated learning framework combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN), named Federated Graph Neural Network Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (FGNN-MADRL), to optimize AoI across the system. For the first time, road scenarios are constructed as graph data structures, and a GNN-based federated learning framework is proposed, effectively combining distributed and centralized federated aggregation. Furthermore, we propose a new MADRL algorithm that simplifies decision making and enhances offloading efficiency, further reducing the decision complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach to other methods through simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Journal.

| **[Bridging Smoothness and Approximation: Theoretical Insights into Over-Smoothing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01281v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the approximation theory of functions defined on graphs. Our study builds upon the approximation results derived from the $K$-functional. We establish a theoretical framework to assess the lower bounds of approximation for target functions using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and examine the over-smoothing phenomenon commonly observed in these networks. Initially, we introduce the concept of a $K$-functional on graphs, establishing its equivalence to the modulus of smoothness. We then analyze a typical type of GCN to demonstrate how the high-frequency energy of the output decays, an indicator of over-smoothing. This analysis provides theoretical insights into the nature of over-smoothing within GCNs. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for the approximation of target functions by GCNs, which is governed by the modulus of smoothness of these functions. This finding offers a new perspective on the approximation capabilities of GCNs. In our numerical experiments, we analyze several widely applied GCNs and observe the phenomenon of energy decay. These observations corroborate our theoretical results on exponential decay order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amplify Graph Learning for Recommendation via Sparsity Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18984v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning models have been widely deployed in collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation systems. Due to the issue of data sparsity, the graph structure of the original input lacks potential positive preference edges, which significantly reduces the performance of recommendations. In this paper, we study how to enhance the graph structure for CF more effectively, thereby optimizing the representation of graph nodes. Previous works introduced matrix completion techniques into CF, proposing the use of either stochastic completion methods or superficial structure completion to address this issue. However, most of these approaches employ random numerical filling that lack control over noise perturbations and limit the in-depth exploration of higher-order interaction features of nodes, resulting in biased graph representations. In this paper, we propose an Amplify Graph Learning framework based on Sparsity Completion (called AGL-SC). First, we utilize graph neural network to mine direct interaction features between user and item nodes, which are used as the inputs of the encoder. Second, we design a factorization-based method to mine higher-order interaction features. These features serve as perturbation factors in the latent space of the hidden layer to facilitate generative enhancement. Finally, by employing the variational inference, the above multi-order features are integrated to implement the completion and enhancement of missing graph structures. We conducted benchmark and strategy experiments on four real-world datasets related to recommendation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that AGL-SC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-based Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04043v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains with interdependent data, such as graphs, quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is challenging as uncertainty can arise at different structural scales. Existing techniques neglect this issue or only distinguish between structure-aware and structure-agnostic uncertainty without combining them into a single measure. We propose GEBM, an energy-based model (EBM) that provides high-quality uncertainty estimates by aggregating energy at different structural levels that naturally arise from graph diffusion. In contrast to logit-based EBMs, we provably induce an integrable density in the data space by regularizing the energy function. We introduce an evidential interpretation of our EBM that significantly improves the predictive robustness of the GNN. Our framework is a simple and effective post hoc method applicable to any pre-trained GNN that is sensitive to various distribution shifts. It consistently achieves the best separation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on 6 out of 7 anomaly types while having the best average rank over shifts on \emph{all} datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining the Explainers in Graph Neural Networks: a Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15304v3)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following a fast initial breakthrough in graph based learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have reached a widespread application in many science and engineering fields, prompting the need for methods to understand their decision process. GNN explainers have started to emerge in recent years, with a multitude of methods both novel or adapted from other domains. To sort out this plethora of alternative approaches, several studies have benchmarked the performance of different explainers in terms of various explainability metrics. However, these earlier works make no attempts at providing insights into why different GNN architectures are more or less explainable, or which explainer should be preferred in a given setting. In this survey, we fill these gaps by devising a systematic experimental study, which tests ten explainers on eight representative architectures trained on six carefully designed graph and node classification datasets. With our results we provide key insights on the choice and applicability of GNN explainers, we isolate key components that make them usable and successful and provide recommendations on how to avoid common interpretation pitfalls. We conclude by highlighting open questions and directions of possible future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Error of Graph Neural Networks in the Mean-field Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07025v3)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work provides a theoretical framework for assessing the generalization error of graph neural networks in the over-parameterized regime, where the number of parameters surpasses the quantity of data points. We explore two widely utilized types of graph neural networks: graph convolutional neural networks and message passing graph neural networks. Prior to this study, existing bounds on the generalization error in the over-parametrized regime were uninformative, limiting our understanding of over-parameterized network performance. Our novel approach involves deriving upper bounds within the mean-field regime for evaluating the generalization error of these graph neural networks. We establish upper bounds with a convergence rate of $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of graph samples. These upper bounds offer a theoretical assurance of the networks' performance on unseen data in the challenging over-parameterized regime and overall contribute to our understanding of their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[DynamicGlue: Epipolar and Time-Informed Data Association in Dynamic Environments using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11370v3)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assumption of a static environment is common in many geometric computer vision tasks like SLAM but limits their applicability in highly dynamic scenes. Since these tasks rely on identifying point correspondences between input images within the static part of the environment, we propose a graph neural network-based sparse feature matching network designed to perform robust matching under challenging conditions while excluding keypoints on moving objects. We employ a similar scheme of attentional aggregation over graph edges to enhance keypoint representations as state-of-the-art feature-matching networks but augment the graph with epipolar and temporal information and vastly reduce the number of graph edges. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised training scheme to extract pseudo labels for image pairs in dynamic environments from exclusively unprocessed visual-inertial data. A series of experiments show the superior performance of our network as it excludes keypoints on moving objects compared to state-of-the-art feature matching networks while still achieving similar results regarding conventional matching metrics. When integrated into a SLAM system, our network significantly improves performance, especially in highly dynamic scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAGNNs: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks meet Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18380v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto tool for learning node and graph representations. Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message passing) layers. Within each of these layers, the representation of each node is updated from an aggregation and transformation of its neighbours representations at the previous layer. The upper bound for the expressive power of message passing GNNs was reached through the use of MLPs as a transformation, due to their universal approximation capabilities. However, MLPs suffer from well-known limitations, which recently motivated the introduction of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs rely on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, rendering them a promising alternative to MLPs. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs in graph learning tasks. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that while KANs are on-par with MLPs in classification tasks, they seem to have a clear advantage in the graph regression tasks.

| **[SpectralKAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Hyperspectral Images Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00949v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been verified that deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and transformers, can accurately extract features from hyperspectral images (HSIs). These algorithms perform exceptionally well on HSIs change detection (HSIs-CD). However, the downside of these impressive results is the enormous number of parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory, training and test times required. In this paper, we propose an spectral Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for HSIs-CD (SpectralKAN). SpectralKAN represent a multivariate continuous function with a composition of activation functions to extract HSIs feature and classification. These activation functions are b-spline functions with different parameters that can simulate various functions. In SpectralKAN, a KAN encoder is proposed to enhance computational efficiency for HSIs. And a spatial-spectral KAN encoder is introduced, where the spatial KAN encoder extracts spatial features and compresses the spatial dimensions from patch size to one. The spectral KAN encoder then extracts spectral features and classifies them into changed and unchanged categories. We use five HSIs-CD datasets to verify the effectiveness of SpectralKAN. Experimental verification has shown that SpectralKAN maintains high HSIs-CD accuracy while requiring fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory, training and testing times, thereby increasing the efficiency of HSIs-CD. The code will be available at https://github.com/yanhengwang-heu/SpectralKAN.</p></details> |  |

These limitations restrict the practical deployment of GNNs, notably in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, this study introduce <b>Point<\b> <b>Vi<\b>sion <b>G<\b>NN (PointViG), an efficient framework for point cloud analysis. PointViG incorporates a lightweight graph convolutional module to efficiently aggregate local features and mitigate over-smoothing. For large-scale point cloud scenes, we propose an adaptive dilated graph convolution technique that searches for sparse neighboring nodes within a dilated neighborhood based on semantic correlation, thereby expanding the receptive field and ensuring computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that PointViG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while balancing performance and complexity. On the ModelNet40 classification task, PointViG achieved 94.3% accuracy with 1.5M parameters. For the S3DIS segmentation task, it achieved an mIoU of 71.7% with 5.3M parameters. These results underscore the potential and efficiency of PointViG in point cloud analysis.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models to generalize and adapt motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIMOSA: Multi-constraint Molecule Sampling for Molecule Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02318v4)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule optimization is a fundamental task for accelerating drug discovery, with the goal of generating new valid molecules that maximize multiple drug properties while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. Existing generative models and reinforcement learning approaches made initial success, but still face difficulties in simultaneously optimizing multiple drug properties. To address such challenges, we propose the MultI-constraint MOlecule SAmpling (MIMOSA) approach, a sampling framework to use input molecule as an initial guess and sample molecules from the target distribution. MIMOSA first pretrains two property agnostic graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecule topology and substructure-type prediction, where a substructure can be either atom or single ring. For each iteration, MIMOSA uses the GNNs' prediction and employs three basic substructure operations (add, replace, delete) to generate new molecules and associated weights. The weights can encode multiple constraints including similarity and drug property constraints, upon which we select promising molecules for next iteration. MIMOSA enables flexible encoding of multiple property- and similarity-constraints and can efficiently generate new molecules that satisfy various property constraints and achieved up to 49.6% relative improvement over the best baseline in terms of success rate. The code repository (including readme file, data preprocessing and model construction, evaluation) is available https://github.com/futianfan/MIMOSA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2021</p></details> |

Existing models in this area often fall short due to their domain-specific nature and lack a strategy for integrating information from various sources in the absence of ground truth labels. Key challenges include evaluating the quality of different data sources and modeling spatial relationships among them effectively. Addressing these issues, we introduce an innovative multi-source spatial point data prediction framework that adeptly aligns information from varied sources without relying on ground truth labels. A unique aspect of our method is the 'fidelity score,' a quantitative measure for evaluating the reliability of each data source. Furthermore, we develop a geo-location-aware graph neural network tailored to accurately depict spatial relationships between data points. Our framework has been rigorously tested on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset. The results consistently demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning with Spectral Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00708v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs can well describe the complex entity relationships in the real world. For example, online shopping networks contain multiple physical types of consumers and products, as well as multiple relationship types such as purchasing and favoriting. More and more scholars pay attention to this research because heterogeneous graph representation learning shows strong application potential in real-world scenarios. However, the existing heterogeneous graph models use data augmentation techniques to enhance the use of graph structure information, which only captures the graph structure information from the spatial topology, ignoring the information displayed in the spectrum dimension of the graph structure. To address the issue that heterogeneous graph representation learning methods fail to model spectral information, this paper introduces a spectral-enhanced graph contrastive learning model (SHCL) and proposes a spectral augmentation algorithm for the first time in heterogeneous graph neural networks. The proposed model learns an adaptive topology augmentation scheme through the heterogeneous graph itself, disrupting the structural information of the heterogeneous graph in the spectrum dimension, and ultimately improving the learning effect of the model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate substantial advantages of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |
