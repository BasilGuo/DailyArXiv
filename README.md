Modern technological devices such as video recorders and drones now allow researchers to directly observe an animal's behaviour. Using these observations as labels of the latent process can improve a hidden Markov model's accuracy when decoding the latent process. However, many wild animals are observed infrequently. Including such rare labels often has a negligible influence on parameter estimates, which in turn does not meaningfully improve the accuracy of the decoded latent process. We introduce a weighted likelihood approach that increases the relative influence of labelled observations. We use this approach to develop two hidden Markov models to decode the foraging behaviour of killer whales (Orcinus orca) off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Using cross-validated evaluation metrics, we show that our weighted likelihood approach produces more accurate and understandable decoded latent processes compared to existing methods. Thus, our method effectively leverages sparse labels to enhance researchers' ability to accurately decode hidden processes across various fields.</p></details> | 25 pages, 11 figures |

While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior. This aspect becomes particularly critical when the monitored system is deployed in a vital environment. In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, + Supplemental Materials, Published at Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

Our methodology encompasses time series K-means clustering, graph-based algorithms (DeepWalk and LINE), and static attribute clustering, visualized through innovative hybrid charts. Key findings reveal significant variations in player engagement, skill levels, and social interactions across five primary user segments, ranging from highly active and skilled players to inactive or new users. We also analyze the impact of external factors on user retention and the network structure within clusters, uncovering correlations between cluster cohesion and player activity levels. This research provides valuable insights for game developers and marketers, offering data-driven recommendations for personalized game experiences, targeted marketing strategies, and improved player retention in online gaming environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rediscovering Bottom-Up: Effective Forecasting in Temporal Hierarchies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02367v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecast reconciliation has become a prominent topic in recent forecasting literature, with a primary distinction made between cross-sectional and temporal hierarchies. This work focuses on temporal hierarchies, such as aggregating monthly time series data to annual data. We explore the impact of various forecast reconciliation methods on temporally aggregated ARIMA models, thereby bridging the fields of hierarchical forecast reconciliation and temporal aggregation both theoretically and experimentally. Our paper is the first to theoretically examine the effects of temporal hierarchical forecast reconciliation, demonstrating that the optimal method aligns with a bottom-up aggregation approach. To assess the practical implications and performance of the reconciled forecasts, we conduct a series of simulation studies, confirming that the findings extend to more complex models. This result helps explain the strong performance of the bottom-up approach observed in many prior studies. Finally, we apply our methods to real data examples, where we observe similar results.</p></details> |  |
| **[A multi-source data power load forecasting method using attention mechanism-based parallel cnn-gru](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17889v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate power load forecasting is crucial for improving energy efficiency and ensuring power supply quality. Considering the power load forecasting problem involves not only dynamic factors like historical load variations but also static factors such as climate conditions that remain constant over specific periods. From the model-agnostic perspective, this paper proposes a parallel structure network to extract important information from both dynamic and static data. Firstly, based on complexity learning theory, it is demonstrated that models integrated through parallel structures exhibit superior generalization abilities compared to individual base learners. Additionally, the higher the independence between base learners, the stronger the generalization ability of the parallel structure model. This suggests that the structure of machine learning models inherently contains significant information. Building on this theoretical foundation, a parallel convolutional neural network (CNN)-gate recurrent unit (GRU) attention model (PCGA) is employed to address the power load forecasting issue, aiming to effectively integrate the influences of dynamic and static features. The CNN module is responsible for capturing spatial characteristics from static data, while the GRU module captures long-term dependencies in dynamic time series data. The attention layer is designed to focus on key information from the spatial-temporal features extracted by the parallel CNN-GRU. To substantiate the advantages of the parallel structure model in extracting and integrating multi-source information, a series of experiments are conducted.</p></details> |  |

The present research aims at characterizing two different approaches to the problem of stuck values detection in multivariate time series coming from spacecraft attitude sensors.

| **[Enriched Functional Tree-Based Classifiers: A Novel Approach Leveraging Derivatives and Geometric Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17804v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The positioning of this research falls within the scalar-on-function classification literature, a field of significant interest across various domains, particularly in statistics, mathematics, and computer science. This study introduces an advanced methodology for supervised classification by integrating Functional Data Analysis (FDA) with tree-based ensemble techniques for classifying high-dimensional time series. The proposed framework, Enriched Functional Tree-Based Classifiers (EFTCs), leverages derivative and geometric features, benefiting from the diversity inherent in ensemble methods to further enhance predictive performance and reduce variance. While our approach has been tested on the enrichment of Functional Classification Trees (FCTs), Functional K-NN (FKNN), Functional Random Forest (FRF), Functional XGBoost (FXGB), and Functional LightGBM (FLGBM), it could be extended to other tree-based and non-tree-based classifiers, with appropriate considerations emerging from this investigation. Through extensive experimental evaluations on seven real-world datasets and six simulated scenarios, this proposal demonstrates fascinating improvements over traditional approaches, providing new insights into the application of FDA in complex, high-dimensional learning problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Granger Causality for Mixed Time Series Generalized Linear Models: A Case Study on Multimodal Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17751v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is motivated by studies in neuroscience experiments to understand interactions between nodes in a brain network using different types of data modalities that capture different distinct facets of brain activity. To assess Granger-causality, we introduce a flexible framework through a general class of models that accommodates mixed types of data (binary, count, continuous, and positive components) formulated in a generalized linear model (GLM) fashion. Statistical inference for causality is performed based on both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, with a focus on the latter. Here, we develop a procedure for conducting inference through the proposed Bayesian mixed time series model. By introducing spike and slab priors for some parameters in the model, our inferential approach guides causality order selection and provides proper uncertainty quantification. The proposed methods are then utilized to study the rat spike train and local field potentials (LFP) data recorded during the olfaction working memory task. The proposed methodology provides critical insights into the causal relationship between the rat spiking activity and LFP spectral power. Specifically, power in the LFP beta band is predictive of spiking activity 300 milliseconds later, providing a novel analytical tool for this area of emerging interest in neuroscience and demonstrating its usefulness and flexibility in the study of causality in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Stationarity of Manifold Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17706v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern interdisciplinary research, manifold time series data have been garnering more attention. A critical question in analyzing such data is ``stationarity'', which reflects the underlying dynamic behavior and is crucial across various fields like cell biology, neuroscience and empirical finance. Yet, there has been an absence of a formal definition of stationarity that is tailored to manifold time series. This work bridges this gap by proposing the first definitions of first-order and second-order stationarity for manifold time series. Additionally, we develop novel statistical procedures to test the stationarity of manifold time series and study their asymptotic properties. Our methods account for the curved nature of manifolds, leading to a more intricate analysis than that in Euclidean space. The effectiveness of our methods is evaluated through numerical simulations and their practical merits are demonstrated through analyzing a cell-type proportion time series dataset from a paper recently published in Cell. The first-order stationarity test result aligns with the biological findings of this paper, while the second-order stationarity test provides numerical support for a critical assumption made therein.</p></details> |  |
| **[PGN: The RNN's New Successor is Effective for Long-Range Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17703v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the recurrent structure of RNN, the long information propagation path poses limitations in capturing long-term dependencies, gradient explosion/vanishing issues, and inefficient sequential execution. Based on this, we propose a novel paradigm called Parallel Gated Network (PGN) as the new successor to RNN. PGN directly captures information from previous time steps through the designed Historical Information Extraction (HIE) layer and leverages gated mechanisms to select and fuse it with the current time step information. This reduces the information propagation path to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, effectively addressing the limitations of RNN. To enhance PGN's performance in long-range time series forecasting tasks, we propose a novel temporal modeling framework called Temporal PGN (TPGN). TPGN incorporates two branches to comprehensively capture the semantic information of time series. One branch utilizes PGN to capture long-term periodic patterns while preserving their local characteristics. The other branch employs patches to capture short-term information and aggregate the global representation of the series. TPGN achieves a theoretical complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$, ensuring efficiency in its operations. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and high efficiency of TPGN, further confirming the effectiveness of PGN as the new successor to RNN in long-range time series forecasting. The code is available in this repository: \url{https://github.com/Water2sea/TPGN}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks for Temporal Data Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16959v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal data modelling techniques with neural networks are useful in many domain applications, including time-series forecasting and control engineering. This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CMamba: Channel Correlation Enhanced State Space Models for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05316v3)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multivariate time series forecasting have been propelled by Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models, with Transformer-based architectures gaining prominence for their efficacy in temporal and cross-channel mixing. More recently, Mamba, a state space model, has emerged with robust sequence and feature mixing capabilities. However, the suitability of the vanilla Mamba design for time series forecasting remains an open question, particularly due to its inadequate handling of cross-channel dependencies. Capturing cross-channel dependencies is critical in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series prediction. Recent findings show that self-attention excels in capturing cross-channel dependencies, whereas other simpler mechanisms, such as MLP, may degrade model performance. This is counterintuitive, as MLP, being a learnable architecture, should theoretically capture both correlations and irrelevances, potentially leading to neutral or improved performance. Diving into the self-attention mechanism, we attribute the observed degradation in MLP performance to its lack of data dependence and global receptive field, which result in MLP's lack of generalization ability. Based on the above insights, we introduce a refined Mamba variant tailored for time series forecasting. Our proposed model, \textbf{CMamba}, incorporates a modified Mamba (M-Mamba) module for temporal dependencies modeling, a global data-dependent MLP (GDD-MLP) to effectively capture cross-channel dependencies, and a Channel Mixup mechanism to mitigate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our model in improving forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From News to Forecast: Integrating Event Analysis in LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting with Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17515v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance time series forecasting using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents. With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates various social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations for enriched insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning and reflection to evaluate predictions. This enables our model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By compiling selected news with time series data, we fine-tune the LLaMa2 pre-trained model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and suggest a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting by effectively harnessing unstructured news data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Time Series is Worth Five Experts: Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17440v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic prediction faces significant challenges, necessitating a deep understanding of both temporal and spatial cues and their complex interactions across multiple variables. Recent advancements in traffic prediction systems are primarily due to the development of complex sequence-centric models. However, existing approaches often embed multiple variables and spatial relationships at each time step, which may hinder effective variable-centric learning, ultimately leading to performance degradation in traditional traffic prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce variable-centric and prior knowledge-centric modeling techniques. Specifically, we propose a Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (TITAN) model for traffic flow prediction. TITAN initially consists of three experts focused on sequence-centric modeling. Then, designed a low-rank adaptive method, TITAN simultaneously enables variable-centric modeling. Furthermore, we supervise the gating process using a prior knowledge-centric modeling strategy to ensure accurate routing. Experiments on two public traffic network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate that TITAN effectively captures variable-centric dependencies while ensuring accurate routing. Consequently, it achieves improvements in all evaluation metrics, ranging from approximately 4.37\% to 11.53\%, compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The code is open at \href{https://github.com/sqlcow/TITAN}{https://github.com/sqlcow/TITAN}.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Solar Active Regions Emergence Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17421v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We developed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the formation of active regions (ARs) on the solar surface. Using the Doppler shift velocity, the continuum intensity, and the magnetic field observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we have created time-series datasets of acoustic power and magnetic flux, which are used to train LSTM models on predicting continuum intensity, 12 hours in advance. These novel machine learning (ML) models are able to capture variations of the acoustic power density associated with upcoming magnetic flux emergence and continuum intensity decrease. Testing of the models' performance was done on data for 5 ARs, unseen from the models during training. Model 8, the best performing model trained, was able to make a successful prediction of emergence for all testing active regions in an experimental setting and three of them in an operational. The model predicted the emergence of AR11726, AR13165, and AR13179 respectively 10, 29, and 5 hours in advance, and variations of this model achieved average RMSE values of 0.11 for both active and quiet areas on the solar disc. This work sets the foundations for ML-aided prediction of solar ARs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, under review at the AAS Astrophysical Journal</p></details> |
| **[Pre-Finetuning with Impact Duration Awareness for Stock Movement Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17419v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the duration of news events' impact on the stock market is crucial for effective time-series forecasting, yet this facet is largely overlooked in current research. This paper addresses this research gap by introducing a novel dataset, the Impact Duration Estimation Dataset (IDED), specifically designed to estimate impact duration based on investor opinions. Our research establishes that pre-finetuning language models with IDED can enhance performance in text-based stock movement predictions. In addition, we juxtapose our proposed pre-finetuning task with sentiment analysis pre-finetuning, further affirming the significance of learning impact duration. Our findings highlight the promise of this novel research direction in stock movement prediction, offering a new avenue for financial forecasting. We also provide the IDED and pre-finetuned language models under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license for academic use, fostering further exploration in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>NTCIR...</summary><p>NTCIR-18 FinArg-2 Dataset</p></details> |
| **[Gaussian Processes for Time Series with Lead-Lag Effects with applications to biology data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07400v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Investigating the relationship, particularly the lead-lag effect, between time series is a common question across various disciplines, especially when uncovering biological process. However, analyzing time series presents several challenges. Firstly, due to technical reasons, the time points at which observations are made are not at uniform inintervals. Secondly, some lead-lag effects are transient, necessitating time-lag estimation based on a limited number of time points. Thirdly, external factors also impact these time series, requiring a similarity metric to assess the lead-lag relationship. To counter these issues, we introduce a model grounded in the Gaussian process, affording the flexibility to estimate lead-lag effects for irregular time series. In addition, our method outputs dissimilarity scores, thereby broadening its applications to include tasks such as ranking or clustering multiple pair-wise time series when considering their strength of lead-lag effects with external factors. Crucially, we offer a series of theoretical proofs to substantiate the validity of our proposed kernels and the identifiability of kernel parameters. Our model demonstrates advances in various simulations and real-world applications, particularly in the study of dynamic chromatin interactions, compared to other leading methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nothing Conformal about Adaptive Conformal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15548v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction is a widely-used framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification, which generates valid prediction sets at a user-defined significance level. However, this framework relies on the assumption that the data-generating distribution is exchangeable, a condition that is frequently violated in time-series and other structured data. In such cases, the validity guarantees of conformal prediction break down. Adaptive conformal inference (ACI) has been proposed as a solution for non-exchangeable data by dynamically adjusting the significance level to retain at least finite sample guarantees on the marginal coverage error rate. This paper demonstrates that, despite its name, ACI does not strictly require the use of conformal predictors. Instead, it can operate effectively with the more general concept of a confidence predictor, which is often computationally simpler. The key requirement is that larger significance levels correspond to smaller prediction sets, a property known as nested prediction sets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we investigate whether ACI with conformal predictors offers advantages over confidence predictors. Our results indicate that confidence predictors can perform just as well, and sometimes better than conformal predictors in some cases, although further empirical studies are needed to determine when one approach may be preferable.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Sparsity, Regularization and Causality in Agricultural Yield: The Case of Paddy Rice in Peru](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17298v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a novel approach that integrates agricultural census data with remotely sensed time series to develop precise predictive models for paddy rice yield across various regions of Peru. By utilizing sparse regression and Elastic-Net regularization techniques, the study identifies causal relationships between key remotely sensed variables-such as NDVI, precipitation, and temperature-and agricultural yield. To further enhance prediction accuracy, the first- and second-order dynamic transformations (velocity and acceleration) of these variables are applied, capturing non-linear patterns and delayed effects on yield. The findings highlight the improved predictive performance when combining regularization techniques with climatic and geospatial variables, enabling more precise forecasts of yield variability. The results confirm the existence of causal relationships in the Granger sense, emphasizing the value of this methodology for strategic agricultural management. This contributes to more efficient and sustainable production in paddy rice cultivation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CROSS-GAiT: Cross-Attention-Based Multimodal Representation Fusion for Parametric Gait Adaptation in Complex Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17262v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CROSS-GAiT, a novel algorithm for quadruped robots that uses Cross Attention to fuse terrain representations derived from visual and time-series inputs, including linear accelerations, angular velocities, and joint efforts. These fused representations are used to adjust the robot's step height and hip splay, enabling adaptive gaits that respond dynamically to varying terrain conditions. We generate these terrain representations by processing visual inputs through a masked Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and time-series data through a dilated causal convolutional encoder. The cross-attention mechanism then selects and integrates the most relevant features from each modality, combining terrain characteristics with robot dynamics for better-informed gait adjustments. CROSS-GAiT uses the combined representation to dynamically adjust gait parameters in response to varying and unpredictable terrains. We train CROSS-GAiT on data from diverse terrains, including asphalt, concrete, brick pavements, grass, dense vegetation, pebbles, gravel, and sand. Our algorithm generalizes well and adapts to unseen environmental conditions, enhancing real-time navigation performance. CROSS-GAiT was implemented on a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 robot and extensively tested in complex terrains with high vegetation density, uneven/unstable surfaces, sand banks, deformable substrates, etc. We observe at least a 7.04% reduction in IMU energy density and a 27.3% reduction in total joint effort, which directly correlates with increased stability and reduced energy usage when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, CROSS-GAiT demonstrates at least a 64.5% increase in success rate and a 4.91% reduction in time to reach the goal in four complex scenarios. Additionally, the learned representations perform 4.48% better than the state-of-the-art on a terrain classification task.</p></details> |  |

The method is based on point forecasts published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as robust statistics from the empirical distribution of the IMF's past forecast errors while imposing coherence of prediction intervals across horizons. We show that the technique yields calibrated prediction intervals and performs similar to, or better than, more complex time series models in terms of statistical loss functions. We provide a simple website with graphical illustrations of our forecasts, as well as time-stamped data files that document their real time character.</p></details> |  |

These problems lead to severe water shortages that threaten ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities. To advance the fight against these challenges, we present a new dataset, SEN12-WATER, along with a benchmark using a novel end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) framework for proactive drought-related analysis. The dataset, identified as a spatiotemporal datacube, integrates SAR polarization, elevation, slope, and multispectral optical bands. Our DL framework enables the analysis and estimation of water losses over time in reservoirs of interest, revealing significant insights into water dynamics for drought analysis by examining temporal changes in physical quantities such as water volume. Our methodology takes advantage of the multitemporal and multimodal characteristics of the proposed dataset, enabling robust generalization and advancing understanding of drought, contributing to climate change resilience and sustainable water resource management. The proposed framework involves, among the several components, speckle noise removal from SAR data, a water body segmentation through a U-Net architecture, the time series analysis, and the predictive capability of a Time-Distributed-Convolutional Neural Network (TD-CNN). Results are validated through ground truth data acquired on-ground via dedicated sensors and (tailored) metrics, such as Precision, Recall, Intersection over Union, Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.

| **[TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15586v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08790v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to time series forecasting, leveraging their adaptive activation functions for enhanced predictive modeling. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs replace traditional linear weights with spline-parametrized univariate functions, allowing them to learn activation patterns dynamically. We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal starting point for time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16843v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on time series forecasting mainly focus on improving the forecasting models themselves. However, managing the length of the input data can also significantly enhance prediction performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimal Starting Point Time Series Forecast (OSP-TSP) to capture the intrinsic characteristics of time series data. By adjusting the sequence length via leveraging the XGBoost and LightGBM models, the proposed approach can determine optimal starting point (OSP) of the time series and thus enhance the prediction performances. The performances of the OSP-TSP approach are then evaluated across various frequencies on the M4 dataset and other real-world datasets. Empirical results indicate that predictions based on the OSP-TSP approach consistently outperform those using the complete dataset. Moreover, recognizing the necessity of sufficient data to effectively train models for OSP identification, we further propose targeted solutions to address the issue of data insufficiency.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in exploring the impact of food intake on physiological indicators (e.g., weight) over time. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the DietDiary dataset, which encompasses daily dietary diaries and corresponding weight measurements of real users. Furthermore, we propose a novel task of weight prediction with a dietary diary that aims to leverage historical food intake and weight to predict future weights. To tackle this task, we propose a model-agnostic time series forecasting framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Meal Representation Learning (UMRL) module to extract representations for each meal. Additionally, we design a diet-aware loss function to associate food intake with weight variations. By conducting experiments on the DietDiary dataset with two state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, NLinear and iTransformer, we demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to the original models. We make our dataset, code, and models publicly available at: https://yxg1005.github.io/weight-prediction/.</p></details> | ACM MM'24 oral |

This study conducts a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

This is achieved by embedding tabular data into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces resulting in similar structures as time-series data. We introduce a novel credibility mechanism to this Transformer architecture. This credibility mechanism is based on a special token that should be seen as an encoder that consists of a credibility weighted average of prior information and observation based information. We demonstrate that this novel credibility mechanism is very beneficial to stabilize training, and our Credibility Transformer leads to predictive models that are superior to state-of-the-art deep learning models.</p></details> | 30 pages |

In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.</p></details> |  |

We used ECG-Image-Kit, an open-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG printouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions such as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both digitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records from the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create high-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both programmatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking, staining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various lighting conditions to create real-world artifacts. The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide range of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth time-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing machine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The images vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs of degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization algorithms. ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and non-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for developing robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG images into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG digitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used in the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fi$^2$VTS: Time Series Forecasting Via Capturing Intra- and Inter-Variable Variations in the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21275v5)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in various applications, including electricity transformation, medical monitoring, and crop growth. Despite the advancements in deep learning methods for TSF, their capacity to predict long-term series remains constrained. This limitation arises from the failure to account for both intra- and inter-variable variations meanwhile. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce the Fi$^2$VBlock, which leverages a \textbf{F}requency domain perspective to capture \textbf{i}ntra- and \textbf{i}nter-variable \textbf{V}ariations. After transforming into the frequency domain via the Frequency Transform Module, the Frequency Cross Attention between the real and imaginary parts is designed to obtain enhanced frequency representations and capture intra-variable variations. Furthermore, Inception blocks are employed to integrate information, thus capturing correlations across different variables. Our backbone network, Fi$^2$VTS, employs a residual architecture by concatenating multiple Fi$^2$VBlocks, thereby preventing degradation issues. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Fi$^2$VTS achieves a substantial reduction in both time and memory complexity, decreasing from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ per Fi$^2$VBlock computation. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets reveal that Fi$^2$VTS delivers an overall relative Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction of 30\% and an overall relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction of 22\% when compared to the latest state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is accessible at \url{https://github.com/HITshenrj/Fi2VTS}.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT- Event-Based Masked Auto Encoding for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16554v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular time series, where data points are recorded at uneven intervals, are prevalent in healthcare settings, such as emergency wards where vital signs and laboratory results are captured at varying times. This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy. The code has been released at https://github.com/hrishi-ds/EMIT .</p></details> |  |

Despite a recent increase in the number of automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are not available at every forecast cycle. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; it relies only on geostationary IR satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10-15 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 10 channels at lag times up to 3 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.9/23.3/32.0 km for all systems, 25.7/22.3/30.5 km for tropical systems, and 15.7/13.6/18.6 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors when microwave or scatterometer data are available, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification (UQ), producing a well calibrated ensemble of 200 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10-15 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AMS journal Weather and Forecasting.

The accuracy of oil forecasts is a critical determinant of economic projections, hydrocarbon reserves estimation, construction of fluid processing facilities, and energy price fluctuations. Leveraging generative AI techniques, we model time series forecasting of oil and water productions across four multi-well sites spanning four decades. Our goal is to effectively model uncertainties and make precise forecasts to inform decision-making processes at the field scale. We utilize an autoregressive model known as TimeGrad and a variant of a transformer architecture named Informer, tailored specifically for forecasting long sequence time series data. Predictions from both TimeGrad and Informer closely align with the ground truth data. The overall performance of the Informer stands out, demonstrating greater efficiency compared to TimeGrad in forecasting oil production rates across all sites.</p></details> |  |

To date, neural network is considered the main machine learning tool for the financial prices prediction. Transfer Learning, as a method aimed at transferring knowledge from source tasks to target tasks, can represent a very useful methodological tool for getting better financial prediction capability. Current reviews on the above body of knowledge are mainly focused on neural network architectures, for financial prediction, with very little emphasis on the transfer learning methodology; thus, this paper is aimed at going deeper on this topic by developing a systematic review with respect to application of Transfer Learning for financial market predictions and to challenges/potential future directions of the transfer learning methodologies for stock market predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Generally, artificial neural network based MPPT algorithms use basic neural network architectures and inputs which do not represent the ambient conditions in a comprehensive manner. In this article, the ambient conditions of a location are represented through a comprehensive set of environmental features. Furthermore, the inclusion of time based features in the input data is considered to model cyclic patterns temporally within the atmospheric conditions leading to robust modeling of the MPPT algorithm. A transformer based deep learning architecture is trained as a time series prediction model using multidimensional time series input features. The model is trained on a dataset containing typical meteorological year data points of ambient weather conditions from 50 locations. The attention mechanism in the transformer modules allows the model to learn temporal patterns in the data efficiently. The proposed model achieves a 0.47% mean average percentage error of prediction on non zero operating voltage points in a test dataset consisting of data collected over a period of 200 consecutive hours resulting in the average power efficiency of 99.54% and peak power efficiency of 99.98%. The proposed model is validated through real time simulations. The proposed model performs power point tracking in a robust, dynamic, and nonlatent manner, over a wide range of atmospheric conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published June 2022, in Energy Science and Engineering, Volume10, Issue9, Pages 3397-3410</p></details> |
| **[Asymptotic considerations in a Bayesian linear model with nonparametrically modelled time series innovations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16207v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a semiparametric approach within the general Bayesian linear model where the innovations consist of a stationary, mean zero Gaussian time series. While a parametric prior is specified for the linear model coefficients, the autocovariance structure of the time series is modeled nonparametrically using a Bernstein-Gamma process prior for the spectral density function, the Fourier transform of the autocovariance function. When updating this joint prior with Whittle's likelihood, a Bernstein-von-Mises result is established for the linear model coefficients showing the asymptotic equivalence of the corresponding estimators to those obtained from frequentist pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimation under the Whittle likelihood. Local asymptotic normality of the likelihood is shown, demonstrating that the marginal posterior distribution of the linear model coefficients shrinks at parametric rate towards the true value, and that the conditional posterior distribution of the spectral density contracts in the sup-norm, even in the case of a partially misspecified linear model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Evidence Fusion Network: Multi-source View in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06419v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Effective explainable AI techniques are crucial to bridging the gap between model predictions and user understanding. This paper presents a framework - TSFeatLIME, extending TSLIME, tailored specifically for explaining univariate time series forecasting. TSFeatLIME integrates an auxiliary feature into the surrogate model and considers the pairwise Euclidean distances between the queried time series and the generated samples to improve the fidelity of the surrogate models. However, the usefulness of such explanations for human beings remains an open question. We address this by conducting a user study with 160 participants through two interactive interfaces, aiming to measure how individuals from different backgrounds can simulate or predict model output changes in the treatment group and control group. Our results show that the surrogate model under the TSFeatLIME framework is able to better simulate the behaviour of the black-box considering distance, without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the user study suggests that the explanations were significantly more effective for participants without a computer science background.</p></details> |  |

Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, foundation models preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors, demonstrating a surprisingly strong ability to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the promises and pitfalls of foundation models in making zero-shot forecasts of chaotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments welcome.

We present WIAE-GPF, a Weak Innovation AutoEncoder-based Generative Probabilistic Forecasting architecture that generates future samples of multivariate time series. Unlike traditional black-box models, WIAE-GPF offers interpretability through the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation for nonparametric time series, making it a nonparametric generalization of the Wiener/Kalman filter-based forecasting. A novel learning algorithm with structural convergence guarantees is proposed, ensuring that, under ideal training conditions, the generated forecast samples match the ground truth conditional probability distribution. Extensive tests using publicly available data from U.S. independent system operators under various point and probabilistic forecasting metrics demonstrate that WIAE-GPF consistently outperforms classical methods and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Ensembles Meets Quantile Regression: Uncertainty-aware Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01294v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</p></details> | fix typo |

However, due to the lack of explicit and fixed spatial relationships in stock prediction tasks, many STGNNs fail to perform effectively in this domain. While some STGNNs learn spatial relationships from time series, they often lack comprehensiveness. Research indicates that modeling time series using feature changes as tokens reveals entirely different information compared to using time steps as tokens. To more comprehensively extract dynamic spatial information from stock data, we propose a Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer (DPA-STIFormer). DPA-STIFormer models each node via continuous changes in features as tokens and introduces a Double Direction Self-adaptation Fusion mechanism. This mechanism decomposes node encoding into temporal and feature representations, simultaneously extracting different spatial correlations from a double path approach, and proposes a Double-path gating mechanism to fuse these two types of correlation information. Experiments conducted on four stock market datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, validating the model's superior capability in uncovering latent temporal-correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |

Many caregivers and self-trackers want to use these data to help a specific person change their behavior to achieve desired health outcomes. Ideally, this involves discerning possible causes from correlations using that person's own observational time series data. In this paper, we estimate within-individual average treatment effects of physical activity on sleep duration, and vice-versa. We introduce the model twin randomization (MoTR; "motor") method for analyzing an individual's intensive longitudinal data. Formally, MoTR is an application of the g-formula (i.e., standardization, back-door adjustment) under serial interference. It estimates stable recurring effects, as is done in n-of-1 trials and single case experimental designs. We compare our approach to standard methods (with possible confounding) to show how to use causal inference to make better personalized recommendations for health behavior change, and analyze up to almost eight years of the authors' own Fitbit steps and sleep data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables; appendix included</p></details> |
| **[A theory of generalised coordinates for stochastic differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15532v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous modelling tools in physics and the sciences. In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving dynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which renders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored'' noise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for mathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this report, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically studying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the theory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of the noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of Markovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an extended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however, the Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be exact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory is exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when flows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools, which we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be useful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of smoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward methods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we re-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for time-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised coordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages of main, 45 pages including TOC, Appendix and references</p></details> |

However, naive IV estimators may be inconsistent in settings with autocorrelated time series. We argue that causal time graphs can simplify IV identification and help select consistent estimators. To do so, we propose to first model the equilibrium condition by an unobserved confounder, deriving a directed acyclic graph (DAG) while maintaining the assumption of a simultaneous determination of prices and quantities. We then exploit recent advances in graphical inference to derive valid IV estimators, including estimators that achieve consistency by simultaneously estimating nuisance effects. We further argue that observing significant differences between the estimates of presumably valid estimators can help to reject false model assumptions, thereby improving our understanding of underlying economic dynamics. We apply this approach to the German electricity market, estimating the price elasticity of demand on simulated and real-world data. The findings underscore the importance of accounting for structural autocorrelation in IV-based analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotifDisco: Motif Causal Discovery For Time Series Motifs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15219v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call motifs. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify causal relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (motif disco-very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of Motif Causality (MC), inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We also integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for other downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |  |

We argue that the non-uniqueness and rotation invariance of tensor decomposition allow us to identify the directions with largest class-variability and simple graph Laplacian can effectively achieve this objective. Therefore we propose a novel Pseudo Laplacian Contrast (PLC) tensor decomposition framework, which integrates the data augmentation and cross-view Laplacian to enable the extraction of class-aware representations while effectively capturing the intrinsic low-rank structure within reconstruction constraint. An unsupervised alternative optimization algorithm is further developed to iteratively estimate the pseudo graph and minimize the loss using Alternating Least Square (ALS). Extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Its two key components are: 1) the LocalTaylor wrapper which adapts Taylor approximations (used in dynamical systems) for use in neural network-based probabilistic models, and 2) the MHA-X attention block which makes predictions in a way inspired by how Gaussian Processes' mean predictions are linear smoothings of contextual data. Taylorformer outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of log-likelihood on 5/6 classic Neural Process tasks such as meta-learning 1D functions, and has at least a 14\% MSE improvement on forecasting tasks, including electricity, oil temperatures and exchange rates. Taylorformer approximates a consistent stochastic process and provides uncertainty-aware predictions.

| **[Improving Time Series Encoding with Noise-Aware Self-Supervised Learning and an Efficient Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06579v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the time series representation learning problem using self-supervised techniques. Contrastive learning is well-known in this area as it is a powerful method for extracting information from the series and generating task-appropriate representations. Despite its proficiency in capturing time series characteristics, these techniques often overlook a critical factor - the inherent noise in this type of data, a consideration usually emphasized in general time series analysis. Moreover, there is a notable absence of attention to developing efficient yet lightweight encoder architectures, with an undue focus on delivering contrastive losses. Our work address these gaps by proposing an innovative training strategy that promotes consistent representation learning, accounting for the presence of noise-prone signals in natural time series. Furthermore, we propose an encoder architecture that incorporates dilated convolution within the Inception block, resulting in a scalable and robust network with a wide receptive field. Experimental findings underscore the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across various tasks, including forecasting, classification, and abnormality detection. Notably, our method attains the top rank in over two-thirds of the classification UCR datasets, utilizing only 40% of the parameters compared to the second-best approach. Our source code for CoInception framework is accessible at https://github.com/anhduy0911/CoInception.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle with modality alignment, leading to suboptimal results. To address these challenges, we present a novel framework, TS-TCD, which introduces a comprehensive three-tiered cross-modal knowledge distillation mechanism. Unlike prior work that focuses on isolated alignment techniques, our framework systematically integrates: 1) Dynamic Adaptive Gating for Input Encoding and Alignment}, ensuring coherent alignment between time-series tokens and QR-decomposed textual embeddings; 2) Layer-Wise Contrastive Learning}, aligning intermediate representations across modalities to reduce feature-level discrepancies; and 3) Optimal Transport-Driven Output Alignment}, which ensures consistent output predictions through fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark time-series datasets demonstrate that TS-TCD achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming traditional methods in both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Inference for Multi-Step Ahead Time-Series Forecasting Online](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14792v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptation of the well known adaptive conformal inference (ACI) algorithm to achieve finite-sample coverage guarantees in multi-step ahead time-series forecasting in the online setting. ACI dynamically adjusts significance levels, and comes with finite-sample guarantees on coverage, even for non-exchangeable data. Our multi-step ahead ACI procedure inherits these guarantees at each prediction step, as well as for the overall error rate. The multi-step ahead ACI algorithm can be used with different target error and learning rates at different prediction steps, which is illustrated in our numerical examples, where we employ a version of the confromalised ridge regression algorithm, adapted to multi-input multi-output forecasting. The examples serve to show how the method works in practice, illustrating the effect of variable target error and learning rates for different prediction steps, which suggests that a balance may be struck between efficiency (interval width) and coverage.t</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation. We achieved likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Autoregressive Model for Time Series of Random Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03778v2)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random variables in metric spaces indexed by time and observed at equally spaced time points are receiving increased attention due to their broad applicability. The absence of inherent structure in metric spaces has resulted in a literature that is predominantly non-parametric and model-free. To address this gap in models for time series of random objects, we introduce an adaptation of the classical linear autoregressive model tailored for data lying in a Hadamard space. The parameters of interest in this model are the Fr\'echet mean and a concentration parameter, both of which we prove can be consistently estimated from data. Additionally, we propose a test statistic for the hypothesis of absence of serial correlation and establish its asymptotic normality. Finally, we use a permutation-based procedure to obtain critical values for the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Theoretical results of our method, including the convergence of the estimators as well as the size and power of the test, are illustrated through simulations, and the utility of the model is demonstrated by an analysis of a time series of consumer inflation expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge: Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08992v3)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A myriad of algorithms for the automatic analysis of brain MR images is available to support clinicians in their decision-making. For brain tumor patients, the image acquisition time series typically starts with an already pathological scan. This poses problems, as many algorithms are designed to analyze healthy brains and provide no guarantee for images featuring lesions. Examples include, but are not limited to, algorithms for brain anatomy parcellation, tissue segmentation, and brain extraction. To solve this dilemma, we introduce the BraTS inpainting challenge. Here, the participants explore inpainting techniques to synthesize healthy brain scans from lesioned ones. The following manuscript contains the task formulation, dataset, and submission procedure. Later, it will be updated to summarize the findings of the challenge. The challenge is organized as part of the ASNR-BraTS MICCAI challenge.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Discovering stochastic dynamical equations from biological time series data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02645v6)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theoretical studies have shown that stochasticity can affect the dynamics of ecosystems in counter-intuitive ways. However, without knowing the equations governing the dynamics of populations or ecosystems, it is difficult to ascertain the role of stochasticity in real datasets. Therefore, the inverse problem of inferring the governing stochastic equations from datasets is important. Here, we present an equation discovery methodology that takes time series data of state variables as input and outputs a stochastic differential equation. We achieve this by combining traditional approaches from stochastic calculus with the equation-discovery techniques. We demonstrate the generality of the method via several applications. First, we deliberately choose various stochastic models with fundamentally different governing equations; yet they produce nearly identical steady-state distributions. We show that we can recover the correct underlying equations, and thus infer the structure of their stability, accurately from the analysis of time series data alone. We demonstrate our method on two real-world datasets -- fish schooling and single-cell migration -- which have vastly different spatiotemporal scales and dynamics. We illustrate various limitations and potential pitfalls of the method and how to overcome them via diagnostic measures. Finally, we provide our open-source codes via a package named PyDaDDy (Python library for Data Driven Dynamics).</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates: v3: Significantly reorganized the paper and added a section analysis of a cell migration dataset. v4: Update arXiv title to match the updated title of the manuscript. v5: Added sections detailing the limitations of the approach. v6: Rewritten methods section to present the general methodology in more detail</p></details> |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks Against Time-Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02870v2)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing time-series data that contains personal information, particularly in the medical field, presents serious privacy concerns. Sensitive health data from patients is often used to train machine learning models for diagnostics and ongoing care. Assessing the privacy risk of such models is crucial to making knowledgeable decisions on whether to use a model in production or share it with third parties. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) are a key method for this kind of evaluation, however time-series prediction models have not been thoroughly studied in this context. We explore existing MIA techniques on time-series models, and introduce new features, focusing on the seasonality and trend components of the data. Seasonality is estimated using a multivariate Fourier transform, and a low-degree polynomial is used to approximate trends. We applied these techniques to various types of time-series models, using datasets from the health domain. Our results demonstrate that these new features enhance the effectiveness of MIAs in identifying membership, improving the understanding of privacy risks in medical data applications.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Data-Driven Spatiotemporal Feature Representation and Mining in Multidimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14327v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a new method for time series data analysis, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional mining techniques when dealing with multidimensional time series data. Time series data are extensively utilized in diverse fields, including backend services for monitoring and optimizing IT infrastructure, medical diagnosis through continuous patient monitoring and health trend analysis, and internet business for tracking user behavior and forecasting sales. However, since the effective information in time series data is often hidden in sequence fragments, the uncertainty of their length, quantity, and morphological variables brings challenges to mining. To this end, this paper proposes a new spatiotemporal feature representation method, which converts multidimensional time series (MTS) into one-dimensional event sequences by transforming spatially varying events, and uses a series of event symbols to represent the spatial structural information of multidimensional coupling in the sequence, which has good interpretability. Then, this paper introduces a variable-length tuple mining method to extract non-redundant key event subsequences in event sequences as spatiotemporal structural features of motion sequences. This method is an unsupervised method that does not rely on large-scale training samples and defines a new model for representing the spatiotemporal structural features of multidimensional time series. The superior performance of the STEM model is verified by pattern classification experiments on a variety of motion sequences. The research results of this paper provide an important theoretical basis and technical support for understanding and predicting human behavior patterns, and have far-reaching practical application value.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReFine: Boosting Time Series Prediction of Extreme Events by Reweighting and Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14232v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme events are of great importance since they often represent impactive occurrences. For instance, in terms of climate and weather, extreme events might be major storms, floods, extreme heat or cold waves, and more. However, they are often located at the tail of the data distribution. Consequently, accurately predicting these extreme events is challenging due to their rarity and irregularity. Prior studies have also referred to this as the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, which occurs when the distribution of the test data is substantially different from that used for training. In this work, we propose two strategies, reweighting and fine-tuning, to tackle the challenge. Reweighting is a strategy used to force machine learning models to focus on extreme events, which is achieved by a weighted loss function that assigns greater penalties to the prediction errors for the extreme samples relative to those on the remainder of the data. Unlike previous intuitive reweighting methods based on simple heuristics of data distribution, we employ meta-learning to dynamically optimize these penalty weights. To further boost the performance on extreme samples, we start from the reweighted models and fine-tune them using only rare extreme samples. Through extensive experiments on multiple data sets, we empirically validate that our meta-learning-based reweighting outperforms existing heuristic ones, and the fine-tuning strategy can further increase the model performance. More importantly, these two strategies are model-agnostic, which can be implemented on any type of neural network for time series forecasting.

Our research enhances solar flare prediction by utilizing advanced data preprocessing and classification methods on a multivariate time series-based dataset of photospheric magnetic field parameters. First, our study employs a novel preprocessing pipeline that includes missing value imputation, normalization, balanced sampling, near decision boundary sample removal, and feature selection to significantly boost prediction accuracy. Second, we integrate contrastive learning with a GRU regression model to develop a novel classifier, termed ContReg, which employs dual learning methodologies, thereby further enhancing prediction performance. To validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline, we compare and demonstrate the performance gain of each step, and to demonstrate the efficacy of the ContReg classifier, we compare its performance to that of sequence-based deep learning architectures, machine learning models, and findings from previous studies. Our results illustrate exceptional True Skill Statistic (TSS) scores, surpassing previous methods and highlighting the critical role of precise data preprocessing and classifier development in time series-based solar flare prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at ICMLA 2024 on September 7, 2024, as a regular paper for an oral presentation</p></details> |

| **[Test Time Learning for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14012v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability. We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wormhole: Concept-Aware Deep Representation Learning for Co-Evolving Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13857v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying and understanding dynamic concepts in co-evolving sequences is crucial for analyzing complex systems such as IoT applications, financial markets, and online activity logs. These concepts provide valuable insights into the underlying structures and behaviors of sequential data, enabling better decision-making and forecasting. This paper introduces Wormhole, a novel deep representation learning framework that is concept-aware and designed for co-evolving time sequences. Our model presents a self-representation layer and a temporal smoothness constraint to ensure robust identification of dynamic concepts and their transitions. Additionally, concept transitions are detected by identifying abrupt changes in the latent space, signifying a shift to new behavior - akin to passing through a wormhole. This novel mechanism accurately discerns concepts within co-evolving sequences and pinpoints the exact locations of these wormholes, enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively segment time series data into meaningful concepts, providing a valuable tool for analyzing complex temporal patterns and advancing the detection of concept drifts.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often struggle with noise and fail to generalize across varied landscapes, particularly when dealing with cloud cover in optical remote sensing. In response, this study presents a new approach that leverages time series data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery to improve performance under diverse cloud conditions, without the need for manual cloud filtering. We introduce a 3D Vision Transformer architecture specifically designed for satellite image time series, incorporating a memory-efficient attention mechanism. Two models are proposed: PTAViT3D, which handles either S2 or S1 data independently, and PTAViT3D-CA, which fuses both datasets to enhance accuracy. Both models are evaluated under sparse and dense cloud coverage by exploiting spatio-temporal correlations. Our results demonstrate that the models can effectively delineate field boundaries, even with partial (S2 or S2 and S1 data fusion) or dense cloud cover (S1), with the S1-based model providing performance comparable to S2 imagery in terms of spatial resolution. A key strength of this approach lies in its capacity to directly process cloud-contaminated imagery by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations in a memory-efficient manner. This methodology, used in the ePaddocks product to map Australia's national field boundaries, offers a robust, scalable solution adaptable to varying agricultural environments, delivering precision and reliability where existing methods falter.

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Towards Long-Context Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13530v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have shown impressive performance on a variety of tasks, across a wide range of domains, even in zero-shot settings. However, most of these models are designed to handle short univariate time series as an input. This limits their practical use, especially in domains such as healthcare with copious amounts of long and multivariate data with strong temporal and intra-variate dependencies. Our study bridges this gap by cataloging and systematically comparing various context expansion techniques from both language and time series domains, and introducing a novel compressive memory mechanism to allow encoder-only TSFMs to effectively model intra-variate dependencies. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by imbuing MOMENT, a recent family of multi-task time series foundation models, with the multivariate context.</p></details> |  |

Given the inherent ambiguity of this setup, we introduce a novel system, HMD$^2$, designed to balance between motion reconstruction and generation. From a reconstruction standpoint, our system aims to maximally utilize the camera streams to produce both analytical and learned features, including head motion, SLAM point cloud, and image embeddings. On the generative front, HMD$^2$ employs a multi-modal conditional motion Diffusion model, incorporating a time-series backbone to maintain temporal coherence in generated motions, and utilizes autoregressive in-painting to facilitate online motion inference with minimal latency (0.17 seconds). Collectively, we demonstrate that our system offers a highly effective and robust solution capable of scaling to an extensive dataset of over 200 hours collected in a wide range of complex indoor and outdoor environments using publicly available smart glasses.</p></details> |  |

However, the sensitivity of personal health data raises significant privacy concerns. While user de-identification by removing direct identifiers such as names and addresses is commonly employed to protect privacy, the data itself can still be exploited to re-identify individuals. We introduce a novel framework for similarity-based Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) re-identification attacks on time series health data. Using the WESAD dataset and two larger synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that even short segments of sensor data can achieve perfect re-identification with our Slicing-DTW-Attack. Our attack is independent of training data and computes similarity rankings in about 2 minutes for 10,000 subjects on a single CPU core. These findings highlight that de-identification alone is insufficient to protect privacy. As a defense, we show that adding random noise to the signals significantly reduces re-identification risk while only moderately affecting usability in stress detection tasks, offering a promising approach to balancing privacy and utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Distributed Deep Learning models for Purely Exogenous Forecasting. Application to Water Table Depth Prediction using Weather Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13284v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Groundwater resources are one of the most relevant elements in the water cycle, therefore developing models to accurately predict them is a pivotal task in the sustainable resources management framework. Deep Learning (DL) models have been revealed very effective in hydrology, especially by feeding spatially distributed data (e.g. raster data). In many regions, hydrological measurements are difficult to obtain regularly or periodically in time, and in some cases, last available data are not up to date. Reversely, weather data, which significantly impacts water resources, are usually more available and with higher quality. More specifically, we have proposed two different DL models to predict the water table depth in the Grana-Maira catchment (Piemonte, IT) using only exogenous weather image time series. To deal with the image time series, both models are made of a first Time Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (TDC) which encodes the image available at each time step into a vectorial representation. The first model, TDC-LSTM uses then a Sequential Module based on an LSTM layer to learn temporal relations and output the predictions. The second model, TDC-UnPWaveNet uses instead a new version of the WaveNet architecture, adapted here to output a sequence shorter and completely shifted in the future with respect to the input one. To this aim, and to deal with the different sequence lengths in the UnPWaveNet, we have designed a new Channel Distributed layer, that acts like a Time Distributed one but on the channel dimension, i.e. applying the same set of operations to each channel of the input. TDC-LSTM and TDC-UnPWaveNet have shown both remarkable results. However, the two models have focused on different learnable information: TDC-LSTM has focused more on lowering the bias, while the TDC-UnPWaveNet has focused more on the temporal dynamics maximising correlation and KGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational inference for correlated gravitational wave detector network noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13224v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and LISA generate long multivariate time series, which pose significant challenges in spectral density estimation due to a number of overlapping signals as well as the presence of correlated noise. Addressing both issues is crucial for accurately interpreting the signals detected by these instruments. This paper presents an application of a variational inference spectral density estimation method specifically tailored for dealing with correlated noise in the data. It is flexible in that it does not rely on any specific parametric form for the multivariate spectral density. The method employs a blocked Whittle likelihood approximation for stationary time series and utilizes the Cholesky decomposition of the inverse spectral density matrix to ensure a positive definite estimator. A discounted regularized horseshoe prior is applied to the spline coefficients of each Cholesky factor, and the posterior distribution is computed using a stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach. This method is particularly effective in addressing correlated noise, a significant challenge in the analysis of multivariate data from co-located detectors. The method is demonstrated by analyzing 2000 seconds of simulated Einstein Telescope noise, which shows its ability to produce accurate spectral density estimates and quantify coherence between time series components. This makes it a powerful tool for analyzing correlated noise in gravitational wave data.</p></details> |  |

This model integrates the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer encoders to capture complex spatial-temporal relationships inherent in time series data. The ConvLSTMTransNet model was evaluated against three baseline models: RNN, LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), using real internet traffic data sampled from high-speed ports on a provider edge router. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) were used to assess each model's accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that ConvLSTMTransNet significantly outperforms the baseline models by approximately 10% in terms of prediction accuracy. ConvLSTMTransNet surpasses traditional models due to its innovative architectural features, which enhance its ability to capture temporal dependencies and extract spatial features from internet traffic data. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of employing advanced architectures tailored to the complexities of internet traffic data for achieving more precise predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, Submitted to IEEE Virtual Conference on Communications 2024</p></details> |
| **[Neural Networks with LSTM and GRU in Modeling Active Fires in the Amazon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02681v3)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling and forecasting the historical time series of active fire spots detected by the AQUA\_M-T satellite in the Amazon, Brazil. The approach employs a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict the monthly accumulations of daily detected active fire spots. Data analysis revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through machine learning techniques. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to both the test and validation sets for both seeds. The results indicate that the combined LSTM and GRU model delivers excellent forecasting performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series.

| **[Perturbation graphs, invariant prediction and causal relations in psychology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00404v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks (graphs) in psychology are often restricted to settings without interventions. Here we consider a framework borrowed from biology that involves multiple interventions from different contexts (observations and experiments) in a single analysis. The method is called perturbation graphs. In gene regulatory networks, the induced change in one gene is measured on all other genes in the analysis, thereby assessing possible causal relations. This is repeated for each gene in the analysis. A perturbation graph leads to the correct set of causes (not necessarily direct causes). Subsequent pruning of paths in the graph (called transitive reduction) should reveal direct causes. We show that transitive reduction will not in general lead to the correct underlying graph. We also show that invariant causal prediction is a generalisation of the perturbation graph method, where including additional variables does reveal direct causes, and thereby replacing transitive reduction. We conclude that perturbation graphs provide a promising new tool for experimental designs in psychology, and combined with invariant causal prediction make it possible to reveal direct causes instead of causal paths. As an illustration we apply the perturbation graphs and invariant causal prediction to a data set about attitudes on meat consumption and to a time series of a patient diagnosed with major depression disorder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased Evaluation of Time-series Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13053v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is an evolving area of research motivated by its critical applications, such as detecting seismic activity, sensor failures in industrial plants, predicting crashes in the stock market, and so on. Across domains, anomalies occur significantly less frequently than normal data, making the F1-score the most commonly adopted metric for anomaly detection. However, in the case of time series, it is not straightforward to use standard F1-score because of the dissociation between `time points' and `time events'. To accommodate this, anomaly predictions are adjusted, called as point adjustment (PA), before the $F_1$-score evaluation. However, these adjustments are heuristics-based, and biased towards true positive detection, resulting in over-estimated detector performance. In this work, we propose an alternative adjustment protocol called ``Balanced point adjustment'' (BA). It addresses the limitations of existing point adjustment methods and provides guarantees of fairness backed by axiomatic definitions of TSAD evaluation.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |

However, little is known about the concepts that these models learn and how can we manipulate them in the latent space. Our study bridges these gaps by identifying concepts learned by these models, localizing them to specific parts of the model, and steering model predictions along these conceptual directions, using synthetic time series data. Our results show that MOMENT, a state-of-the-art foundation model, can discern distinct time series patterns, and that this ability peaks in the middle layers of the network. Moreover, we show that model outputs can be steered using insights from its activations (e.g., by introducing periodic trends to initially constant signals through intervention during inference). Our findings underscore the importance of synthetic data in studying and steering time series foundation models and intervening throughout the whole model (using steering matrices), instead of a single layer.</p></details> |  |

In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Boosting Certified Robustness for Time Series Classification with Efficient Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02802v3)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 4 tables, 10 pages</p></details> |

By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard's Longest6 benchmark, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust State Estimation from Partial Out-Core Measurements with Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Nuclear Reactors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12550v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable, real-time state estimation in nuclear reactors is of critical importance for monitoring, control and safety. It further empowers the development of digital twins that are sufficiently accurate for real-world deployment. As nuclear engineering systems are typically characterised by extreme environments, their in-core sensing is a challenging task, even more so in Generation-IV reactor concepts, which feature molten salt or liquid metals as thermal carriers. The emergence of data-driven methods allows for new techniques for accurate and robust estimation of the full state space vector characterising the reactor (mainly composed by neutron fluxes and the thermal-hydraulics fields). These techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, in order to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) architecture to estimate the entire state vector of a reactor from three, out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. Specifically, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor, in the EVOL geometry (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System project), is demonstrated as a test case, with neutron flux measurements alone allowing for reconstruction of the 20 coupled field variables of the dynamics. This approach can further quantify the uncertainty associated with the state estimation due to its considerably low training cost on compressed data. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</p></details> |  |

This study optimizes causal discovery specifically for time series data, which are common in practical applications. Time series causal discovery is particularly challenging because of temporal dependencies and potential time lag effects. By developing a specialized dataset generator and reducing the computational complexity of the VarLiNGAM model from \( O(m^3 \cdot n) \) to \( O(m^3 + m^2 \cdot n) \), this study enhances the feasibility of processing large datasets. The proposed methods were validated on advanced computational platforms and tested on simulated, real-world, and large-scale datasets, demonstrating improved efficiency and performance. The optimized algorithm achieved 7 to 13 times speedup compared to the original and about 4.5 times speedup compared to the GPU-accelerated version on large-scale datasets with feature sizes from 200 to 400. Our methods extend current causal discovery capabilities, making them more robust, scalable, and applicable to real-world scenarios, facilitating advancements in fields like healthcare and finance.</p></details> |  |

Such real-world data is massive, diverse, multivariate and temporal in nature, therefore requiring modelling of the testee behaviour. We propose a variational autoencoder with multi-head attention (MA-VAE), which, when trained on unlabelled data, not only provides very few false positives but also manages to detect the majority of the anomalies presented. In addition to that, the approach offers a novel way to avoid the bypass phenomenon, an undesirable behaviour investigated in literature. Lastly, the approach also introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. The results are presented in the context of a real-world industrial data set and several experiments are undertaken to further investigate certain aspects of the proposed model. When configured properly, it is 9% of the time wrong when an anomaly is flagged and discovers 67% of the anomalies present. Also, MA-VAE has the potential to perform well with only a fraction of the training and validation subset, however, to extract it, a more sophisticated threshold estimation method is required.</p></details> |  |

Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |

However, due to the mobility of the vehicles and the limited computational resources for performing task offloading in near-real-time, such schemes may require high latency, thus, become even infeasible. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a Trajectory Prediction-based Pre-offloading Decision (TPPD) algorithm for analyzing the historical trajectories of vehicles to predict their future coordinates, thereby allowing for computational resource allocation in advance. We first utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict each vehicle's movement trajectory. Then, based on the task requirements and the predicted trajectories, we devise a dynamic resource allocation algorithm using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) that enables the edge server to minimize task processing delay, while ensuring effective utilization of the available computational resources. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing that, as compared with traditional real-time task offloading strategies, the proposed TPPD algorithm significantly reduces task processing delay while improving resource utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient Trajectory Prediction via Coreset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

After training with this framework, the learned model can improve long-step prediction accuracy significantly given the past trajectories and the context information. The accuracy and effectiveness of the approach are evaluated by comparing the predicted trajectories with the ground truth. The results indicate that the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art predicting methods on a terminal airspace flight trajectory dataset. The trajectories generated by the proposed method have a higher temporal resolution(1 timestep per second vs 0.1 timestep per second) and are closer to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AIAA-JAIS</p></details> |

Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15586v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments.

| **[Historical Trajectory Assisted Zeroth-Order Federated Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a distributed learning framework which enables clients to train models individually and to upload their model updates for aggregation. The local training process heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |

Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack</p></details> |

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, it is challenging for aircraft to sustain efficient air-ground communication in urban circumstances. Without continuous air-ground communication, aircraft may experience course deviation and safety accidents. To address these problems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-aided trajectory optimization scheme is proposed enabling efficient air-ground communication and safe aviation in UAM with a layered airspace structure. This paper first devises a dual-plane RIS communication scheme for layered airspace. It fully engages the omnidirectional and directional signal attributes to reduce the transmission delay of the air-ground communication. Based on the dual-plane RIS configuration, we jointly develop the intra- and inter-layer trajectory scheme to optimize communication and safe aviation. In the intra-layer trajectory optimization, we propose a dual-time-scale flight scheme to improve communication capacity and horizontal flight safety. Meanwhile, we propose a safe layer-switching method to ensure collision avoidance during vertical flight in the inter-layer trajectory optimization. The communication load of the proposed scheme can be improved 40% and the time of safe separation restoration can be lessened 66% compared with the benchmarks in the layered airspace.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Real-time Planning of Minimum-time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16074v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Intention-based and Risk-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving in Complex Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15821v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the trajectory of surrounding vehicles is a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles. In complex traffic scenarios, there are two significant issues with the current autonomous driving system: the cognitive uncertainty of prediction and the lack of risk awareness, which limit the further development of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model that incorporates insights and principles from driving behavior, ethical decision-making, and risk assessment. Based on joint prediction, our model consists of interaction, intention, and risk assessment modules. The dynamic variation of interaction between vehicles can be comprehensively captured at each timestamp in the interaction module. Based on interaction information, our model considers primary intentions for vehicles to enhance the diversity of trajectory generation. The optimization of predicted trajectories follows the advanced risk-aware decision-making principles. Experimental results are evaluated on the DeepAccident dataset; our approach shows its remarkable prediction performance on normal and accident scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 28.9\% and 26.5\%, respectively. The proposed model improves the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction in complex traffic scenarios. The code for the proposed model is available at https://sites.google.com/view/ir-prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle+: Learning the Angle-based Conditioned Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14984v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect of understanding human behaviors. Researchers have made efforts to represent socially interactive behaviors among pedestrians and utilize various networks to enhance prediction capability. Unfortunately, they still face challenges not only in fully explaining and measuring how these interactive behaviors work to modify trajectories but also in modeling pedestrians' preferences to plan or participate in social interactions in response to the changeable physical environments as extra conditions. This manuscript mainly focuses on the above explainability and conditionality requirements for trajectory prediction networks. Inspired by marine animals perceiving other companions and the environment underwater by echolocation, this work constructs an angle-based conditioned social interaction representation SocialCircle+ to represent the socially interactive context and its corresponding conditions. It employs a social branch and a conditional branch to describe how pedestrians are positioned in prediction scenes socially and physically in angle-based-cyclic-sequence forms. Then, adaptive fusion is applied to fuse the above conditional clues onto the social ones to learn the final interaction representation. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of SocialCircle+ with different trajectory prediction backbones. Moreover, counterfactual interventions have been made to simultaneously verify the modeling capacity of causalities among interactive variables and the conditioning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

Chronic wound treatment is currently a manual process, and we envision a future where robotics and automation will aid in this treatment to reduce cost and improve patient care. In this work, we present the development of the first robotic system for wound dressing removal which is reported to be the worst aspect of living with chronic wounds. Our method leverages differentiable physics-based simulation to perform gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimized trajectory planning. By integrating fracture mechanics of adhesion, we are able to model the peeling effect inherent to dressing adhesion. The system is further guided by carefully designed objective functions that promote both efficient and safe control, reducing the risk of tissue damage. We validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic skin phantoms and real human subjects. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise and safe dressing removal trajectories, offering a promising solution for automating this essential healthcare procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11721v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Integrated Decision Making and Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Under Multimodal Uncertainties: A Bayesian Game Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13993v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interaction between traffic agents is a key issue in designing safe and non-conservative maneuvers in autonomous driving. This problem can be challenging when multi-modality and behavioral uncertainties are engaged. Existing methods either fail to plan interactively or consider unimodal behaviors that could lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, we introduce an integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework based on Bayesian game (i.e., game of incomplete information). Human decisions inherently exhibit discrete characteristics and therefore are modeled as types of players in the game. A general solver based on no-regret learning is introduced to obtain a corresponding Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, which captures the interaction between traffic agents in the multimodal context. With the attained equilibrium, decision-making and trajectory planning are performed simultaneously, and the resulting interactive strategy is shown to be optimal over the expectation of rivals' driving intentions. Closed-loop simulations on different traffic scenarios are performed to illustrate the generalizability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis of combined efficacy and safety outcomes for risk-benefit analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13946v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and effectively communicating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment is the basis of risk benefit analysis (RBA). More efficient and objective tools are needed. We apply Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) to perform RBA with superior objectivity, power, and clarity. We used CWTA to perform 1000-fold simulations of RCTs using ordinal endpoints for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. RCTs were simulated with 1:1 allocation at defined sample sizes and hazard ratios. We studied the simplest case of 3 levels each of toxicity and efficacy and the general case of the advanced cancer trial, with efficacy graded by five RECIST 1.1 health statuses and toxicity by the six-point CTCAE scale (6 x 5 matrix). The latter model was applied to a real-world dose escalation phase I trial in advanced cancer. Simulations in both the 3 x 3 and the 6 x 5 advanced cancer matrix confirmed that drugs with both superior efficacy and toxicity profiles synergize for greater statistical power with CWTA-RBA. The CWTA-RBA 6 x 5 matrix reduced sample size requirements over CWTA efficacy-only analysis. Application to the dose finding phase I clinical trial provided objective, statistically significant validation for the selected dose. CWTA-RBA, by incorporating both drug efficacy and toxicity, provides a single test statistic and plot that analyzes and effectively communicates therapeutic risks and benefits. CWTA-RBA requires fewer patients than CWTA efficacy-only analysis when the experimental drug is both more effective and less toxic. CWTA-RBA facilitates the objective and efficient assessment of new therapies throughout the drug development pathway. Furthermore, several advantages over competing tests in communicating risk-benefit will assist regulatory review, clinical adoption, and understanding of therapeutic risks and benefits by clinicians and patients alike.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The joint angles, the tool orientations and the manufacturing time-sequences are optimized simultaneously on input trajectories with large numbers of waypoints to improve the kinematic smoothness while incorporating the manufacturing constraints. Differently, existing methods always determine them in a decoupled manner. To deal with the large number of waypoints on a toolpath, we propose a decomposition based numerical scheme to optimize the trajectory in an out-of-core manner which can also run in parallel to improve the efficiency. Simulations and physical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method in examples of robot-assisted additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, the complexity of human mobility patterns is oversimplified by these similarities (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. Moreover, we also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to comprehensively assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-71.5% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complex and uncertain nature of the driving environment, it is impractical for autonomous vehicles~(AVs) to exhaustively design planning rules for optimizing future trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a local map representation method called Velocity Field. This approach provides heading and velocity priors for trajectory planning tasks, simplifying the planning process in complex urban driving. The heading and velocity priors can be learned from demonstrations of human drivers using our proposed loss. Additionally, we developed an iterative sampling-based planner to train and compare the differences between local map representations. We investigated local map representation forms for planning performance on a real-world dataset. Compared to learned rasterized cost maps, our method demonstrated greater reliability and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |

However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily utilize stochastic optimal control techniques with chance constraints to maintain a minimum distance among agents with a guaranteed probability. However, these approaches face challenges, such as the use of simplifying assumptions that result in linear system models or Gaussian disturbances, which limit their practicality in complex realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, this work introduces a novel probabilistically robust distributed controller enabling autonomous agents to plan safe trajectories, even under non-Gaussian uncertainty and nonlinear systems. Leveraging exact uncertainty propagation techniques based on mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation, this method transforms non-Gaussian chance constraints into deterministic ones, seamlessly integrating them into a distributed model predictive control framework solvable with standard optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, highlighting its ability to consistently handle various types of uncertainty, ensuring robust and accurate path planning in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2024)</p></details> |

Arguably, the maritime domain lags behind, as ships operate on many more degrees of freedom (thus, a much larger search space): there is less physical infrastructure, and rules are less consistent and constraining than what is found on roads. The problem is further complicated by the inevitable co-existence of autonomous and human-operated ships: the latter may take unpredictable decisions, which require adjustments on the autonomous ones. Finally, the problem is inherently decentralised, there is no central authority, and communication means can be very diverse in terms of communication distance and performance, mandating special care on which information is shared and how. In this work, we elaborate on the challenges of trajectory prediction and adaptation for mixed autonomous and human-operated ships, and we propose initial ideas on potential approaches to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SISSY 2024</p></details> |

As opposed to the standard method of uniformly sampling control inputs (which lead to biased samples of the configuration space), C-Uniform trajectories are generated by control actions which lead to uniform sampling of the configuration space. After presenting an intuitive closed-form solution to generate C-Uniform trajectories for the 1D random-walker, we present a network-flow based optimization method to precompute C-Uniform trajectories for general robot systems. We apply the notion of C-Uniformity to the design of Model Predictive Path Integral controllers. Through simulation experiments, we show that using C-Uniform trajectories significantly improves the performance of MPPI-style controllers, achieving up to 40% coverage performance gain compared to the best baseline. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with an implementation on a 1/10th scale racer.</p></details> |  |

This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis.

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Generic Trajectory Planning Method for Constrained All-Wheel-Steering Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09677v3)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a generic trajectory planning method for wheeled robots with fixed steering axes while the steering angle of each wheel is constrained. In the existing literatures, All-Wheel-Steering (AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibit inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates non-linearity characteristics, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS (C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by iROS 2024</p></details> |

Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results. We apply the method to analyze data from an existing cohort of lung transplant recipients to estimate the effect of Tacrolimus concentrations on the risk of incident chronic kidney disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have discovered that the core idea of our paper overlaps with a previously published work.

By accurately forecasting the movements of other road users, the decision-making capabilities of the autonomous system can be enhanced, making it more effective in responding to dynamic and unpredictable environments and more adaptive to diverse road scenarios. This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

One of the main reasons is the computationally long planning times that come with a large state space. Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

There are several different types of deriving mechanisms considering the real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, etc. The differences in the driving mechanism usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise controlling is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential-driven robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential-driven robot class, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, that inherently matching robots' motion to the control principle for differential-driven robot class. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to show the feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential-driven robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We will release our method as an open-source package.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, \emph{i.e.}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from time-stamped single cell snapshots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v5)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main part of this manuscript (except the part on DRE) has been accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshop HALF-CENTURY OF STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (50SFM)</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Acce...</summary><p>(Accepted/In press) 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow, nor planning with horizons, leading strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce our trajectory planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) bootstrapped by BC for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference trajectory, and performs modified path for different controllers. Our experimental results show that the algorithm can do path-tracking that mimics the expert performance, and avoiding collision to fixed obstacles by trial and errors. This method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in trajectory planning problems of autonomous driving.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Leveraging Moving Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to more precise source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. Initially, sound separation is conducted using rough preliminary sound source tracking results. Sound source tracking is then performed on the separated signals thus the tracking results can become more precise. The precise trajectory can further enhances the separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be performed over several iterations. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberation conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on more precise tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v5)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Conventional methods of optimizing the spray gun trajectory based on simulated thickness can only qualitatively reflect the color distribution, and can not simulate the color effect of spray painting at the pixel level. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately control the area covered by the color and the gradation of the edges of the area, and it is also difficult to deal with the situation where multiple colors of paint are sprayed in combination. To solve the above problems, this paper is inspired by the Kubelka-Munk model and combines the 3D machine vision method and artificial neural network to propose a spray painting color effect prediction method. The method is enabled to predict the execution effect of the spray gun trajectory with pixel-level accuracy from the dimension of the surface color of the workpiece after spray painting. On this basis, the method can be used to replace the traditional thickness simulation method to establish the objective function of the spray gun trajectory optimization problem, and thus solve the difficult problem of spray gun trajectory optimization for multi-color paint combination spraying. In this paper, the mathematical model of the spray painting color effect prediction problem is first determined through the analysis of the Kubelka-Munk paint film color rendering model, and at the same time, the spray painting color effect dataset is established with the help of the depth camera and point cloud processing algorithm. After that, the multilayer perceptron model was improved with the help of gating and residual structure and was used for the color prediction task. To verify ...</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimizing Profilometric Sensor Trajectories for Surface Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03429v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision surface defect detection in manufacturing is essential for ensuring quality control. Laser triangulation profilometric sensors are key to this process, providing detailed and accurate surface measurements over a line. To achieve a complete and precise surface scan, accurate relative motion between the sensor and the workpiece is required. It is crucial to control the sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Online Trajectory Planning for Adaptive Battery Discharging in Fuel Cell Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03201v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an online trajectory planning approach for optimal coordination of Fuel Cell (FC) and battery in plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). One of the main challenges in energy management of plug-in HEV is generating State-of-Charge (SOC) reference curves by optimally depleting battery under high uncertainties in driving scenarios. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of utilizing partial trip information for optimal SOC trajectory planning, but dynamic responses of the FC system are not taken into account. On the other hand, research focusing on dynamic operation of FC systems often focuses on air flow management, and battery has been treated only partially. Our aim is to fill this gap by designing an online trajectory planner for dynamic coordination of FC and battery systems that works with a high-level SOC planner in a hierarchical manner. We propose an iterative LQR based online trajectory planning method where the amount of electricity dischargeable at each driving segment can be explicitly and adaptively specified by the high-level planner. Numerical results are provided as a proof of concept example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADiff: Motion-Aware Mamba Diffusion Models for Hand Trajectory Prediction on Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02638v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human intentions and actions through egocentric videos is important on the path to embodied artificial intelligence. As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional equations and Machine Learning (ML) models using clinical and laboratory data can estimate eGFR, accurately predicting future eGFR levels remains a significant challenge for nephrologists and ML researchers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can serve as robust foundation models for diverse applications. This study investigates the potential of LMMs to predict future eGFR levels with a dataset consisting of laboratory and clinical values from 50 patients. By integrating various prompting techniques and ensembles of LMMs, our findings suggest that these models, when combined with precise prompts and visual representations of eGFR trajectories, offer predictive performance comparable to existing ML models. This research extends the application of foundation models and suggests avenues for future studies to harness these models in addressing complex medical forecasting challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint version includes corrections of typographical errors related to numerical values in Table 2, which were present in the version published at the BDH workshop in MIPR 2024.

| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |

While promising approaches exist, they are often not publicly available, revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in urban settings. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

| **[UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without needing expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods with divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the divide or the conquer procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Learning on Cell-embedded Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18013v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven simulation of physical systems has recently kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in predicting spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message passing mechanism in GNNs limits the model's representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a cell-embedded GNN model (aka CeGNN) to learn spatiotemporal dynamics with lifted performance. Specifically, we introduce a learnable cell attribution to the node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from the first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume to edge and then to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the performance of CeGNN and relieve the over-smoothness problem, via treating the latent features as basis functions. The extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baseline models, particularly reducing the prediction error with up to 1 orders of magnitude on several PDE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supra-Laplacian Encoding for Transformer on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17986v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully connected Graph Transformers (GT) have rapidly become prominent in the static graph community as an alternative to Message-Passing models, which suffer from a lack of expressivity, oversquashing, and under-reaching. However, in a dynamic context, by interconnecting all nodes at multiple snapshots with self-attention, GT loose both structural and temporal information. In this work, we introduce Supra-LAplacian encoding for spatio-temporal TransformErs (SLATE), a new spatio-temporal encoding to leverage the GT architecture while keeping spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we transform Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs into multi-layer graphs and take advantage of the spectral properties of their associated supra-Laplacian matrix. Our second contribution explicitly model nodes' pairwise relationships with a cross-attention mechanism, providing an accurate edge representation for dynamic link prediction. SLATE outperforms numerous state-of-the-art methods based on Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks combined with recurrent models (e.g LSTM), and Dynamic Graph Transformers, on 9 datasets. Code and instructions to reproduce our results will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Point sets with small discrepancy are called low-discrepancy and are known to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. Low-discrepancy points play a central role in many problems in science and engineering, including numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. In this work, we present the first machine learning approach to generate a new class of low-discrepancy point sets named Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) points. Motivated by the geometric nature of generating low-discrepancy point sets, we leverage tools from Geometric Deep Learning and base our model on Graph Neural Networks. We further provide an extension of our framework to higher dimensions, which flexibly allows the generation of custom-made points that emphasize the uniformity in specific dimensions that are primarily important for the particular problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance superior to previous methods by a significant margin. In fact, MPMC points are empirically shown to be either optimal or near-optimal with respect to the discrepancy for low dimension and small number of points, i.e., for which the optimal discrepancy can be determined.

In this field, table rows are usually treated as independent data samples, but additional information about relations between them is sometimes available and can be used to improve predictive performance. Such information can be naturally modeled with a graph, thus tabular machine learning may benefit from graph machine learning methods. However, graph machine learning models are typically evaluated on datasets with homogeneous node features, which have little in common with heterogeneous mixtures of numerical and categorical features present in tabular datasets. Thus, there is a critical difference between the data used in tabular and graph machine learning studies, which does not allow one to understand how successfully graph models can be transferred to tabular data. To bridge this gap, we propose a new benchmark of diverse graphs with heterogeneous tabular node features and realistic prediction tasks. We use this benchmark to evaluate a vast set of models, including simple methods previously overlooked in the literature. Our experiments show that graph neural networks (GNNs) can indeed often bring gains in predictive performance for tabular data, but standard tabular models also can be adapted to work with graph data by using simple feature preprocessing, which sometimes enables them to compete with and even outperform GNNs. Based on our empirical study, we provide insights for researchers and practitioners in both tabular and graph machine learning fields.</p></details> |  |

Mapping an event on web to the popularity score plays a pivot role to sense the social trends from the cyberspace. However, the complex semantic correspondence between texts and images, as well as the implicit text-image-popularity mapping mechanics pose a significant challenge to this non-trivial task. In this paper, we address this problem from a viewpoint of understanding the interpretable mapping mechanics. Concretely, we organize the keywords from different events into an unified graph. The unified graph facilitates to model the popularity of events via two-level mappings, i.e., the self excitation and the mutual excitation. The self-excitation assumes that each keyword forms the popularity while the mutual-excitation models that two keywords would excite each other to determine the popularity of an event. Specifically, we use Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the backbone to model the self-excitation, the mutual excitation and the context of images into a sparse and deep factor model. Besides, to our best knowledge, we release a challenge web event dataset for the popularity prediction task. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/pangjunbiao/Hot-events-dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches have not fully exploited the potential of graphs without modification of edges within and between hand- and object-graphs. We propose a graph-based refinement method that incorporates an interaction-aware graph-attention mechanism to account for hand-object interactions. Using edges, we establish connections among closely correlated nodes, both within individual graphs and across different graphs.

These methods, however, are often not directly applicable to more complex structures like bipartite graphs (equivalent to hypergraphs), which represent interactions among two entity types (e.g. a user liking a movie). This paper proposes Convolutional Signal Propagation (CSP), a non-parametric simple and scalable method that natively operates on bipartite graphs (hypergraphs) and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. After defining CSP, we demonstrate its relationship with well-established methods like label propagation, Naive Bayes, and Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. We evaluate CSP against several reference methods on real-world datasets from multiple domains, focusing on retrieval and classification tasks. Our results show that CSP offers competitive performance while maintaining low computational complexity, making it an ideal first choice as a baseline for hypergraph node classification and retrieval. Moreover, despite operating on hypergraphs, CSP achieves good results in tasks typically not associated with hypergraphs, such as natural language processing.</p></details> |  |

The GlycanML benchmark consists of diverse types of tasks including glycan taxonomy prediction, glycan immunogenicity prediction, glycosylation type prediction, and protein-glycan interaction prediction. Glycans can be represented by both sequences and graphs in GlycanML, which enables us to extensively evaluate sequence-based models and graph neural networks (GNNs) on benchmark tasks. Furthermore, by concurrently performing eight glycan taxonomy prediction tasks, we introduce the GlycanML-MTL testbed for multi-task learning (MTL) algorithms. Experimental results show the superiority of modeling glycans with multi-relational GNNs, and suitable MTL methods can further boost model performance. We provide all datasets and source codes at https://github.com/GlycanML/GlycanML and maintain a leaderboard at https://GlycanML.github.io/project</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research project paper.

In this paper, we argue that context-aware activity visit patterns in realistic in-the-wild data can equivocally be considered as a general graph representation learning task. We posit that exploiting underlying graphical patterns in CHAR data can improve CHAR task performance and representation learning. Building on the intuition that certain activities are frequently performed with the phone placed in certain positions, we focus on the context-aware human activity problem of recognizing the <Activity, Phone Placement> tuple. We demonstrate that CHAR data has an underlying graph structure that can be viewed as a heterogenous hypergraph that has multiple types of nodes and hyperedges (an edge connecting more than two nodes). Subsequently, learning <Activity, Phone Placement> representations becomes a graph node representation learning problem. After task transformation, we further propose a novel Heterogeneous HyperGraph Neural Network architecture for Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HHGNN-CHAR), with three types of heterogeneous nodes (user, phone placement, and activity). Connections between all types of nodes are represented by hyperedges. Rigorous evaluation demonstrated that on an unscripted, in-the-wild CHAR dataset, our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines including CHAR models that do not exploit graphs, and GNN variants that do not incorporate heterogeneous nodes or hyperedges with overall improvements 14.04% on Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and 7.01% on Macro F1 scores.</p></details> | PerCom 2023 |

While the challenges of applying GNNs for node classification when class labels display strong heterophily are well understood, it is unclear how heterophily affects GNN performance in other important graph learning tasks where class labels are not available. In this work, we focus on the link prediction task and systematically analyze the impact of heterophily in node features on GNN performance. Theoretically, we first introduce formal definitions of homophilic and heterophilic link prediction tasks, and present a theoretical framework that highlights the different optimizations needed for the respective tasks. We then analyze how different link prediction encoders and decoders adapt to varying levels of feature homophily and introduce designs for improved performance. Our empirical analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets confirms our theoretical insights and highlights the importance of adopting learnable decoders and GNN encoders with ego- and neighbor-embedding separation in message passing for link prediction tasks beyond homophily.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Multi-resolution Graph Edge Embedding for Discovering Brain Network Dysfunction in Neurological Disorders](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01181v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous recent literature show that associations between different brain regions, i.e., brain connectivity, provide early symptoms of neurological disorders. Despite significant efforts made for graph neural network (GNN) techniques, their focus on graph nodes makes the state-of-the-art GNN methods not suitable for classifying brain connectivity as graphs where the objective is to characterize disease-relevant network dysfunction patterns on graph links. To address this issue, we propose Multi-resolution Edge Network (MENET) to detect disease-specific connectomic benchmarks with high discrimination power across diagnostic categories. The core of MENET is a novel graph edge-wise transform that we propose, which allows us to capture multi-resolution ``connectomic'' features. Using a rich set of the connectomic features, we devise a graph learning framework to jointly select discriminative edges and assign diagnostic labels for graphs. Experiments on two real datasets show that MENET accurately predicts diagnostic labels and identify brain connectivities highly associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Covert Communication Against Multi-UAV Surveillance Using Graph Koopman Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17048v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low Probability of Detection (LPD) communication aims to obscure the presence of radio frequency (RF) signals to evade surveillance. In the context of mobile surveillance utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), achieving LPD communication presents significant challenges due to the UAVs' rapid and continuous movements, which are characterized by unknown nonlinear dynamics. Therefore, accurately predicting future locations of UAVs is essential for enabling real-time LPD communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework termed predictive covert communication, aimed at minimizing detectability in terrestrial ad-hoc networks under multi-UAV surveillance. Our data-driven method synergistically integrates graph neural networks (GNN) with Koopman theory to model the complex interactions within a multi-UAV network and facilitating long-term predictions by linearizing the dynamics, even with limited historical data. Extensive simulation results substantiate that the predicted trajectories using our method result in at least 63%-75% lower probability of detection when compared to well-known state-of-the-art baseline approaches, showing promise in enabling low-latency covert operations in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As such, they share the inherent limitations and problems of deep learning, especially regarding the issues of explainability and trustworthiness. We propose $\mu\mathcal{G}$, an original domain-specific language for the specification of graph neural networks that aims to overcome these issues. The language's syntax is introduced, and its meaning is rigorously defined by a denotational semantics. An equivalent characterization in the form of an operational semantics is also provided and, together with a type system, is used to prove the type soundness of $\mu\mathcal{G}$. We show how $\mu\mathcal{G}$ programs can be represented in a more user-friendly graphical visualization, and provide examples of its generality by showing how it can be used to define some of the most popular graph neural network models, or to develop any custom graph processing application.</p></details> |  |

SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSR-IGRU: Stock Trend Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Relationships and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08282v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods. Our sources are released at https://github.com/ZP1481616577/Baselines_LSR-IGRU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-backtracking Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07430v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The celebrated message-passing updates for graph neural networks allow representing large-scale graphs with local and computationally tractable updates. However, the updates suffer from backtracking, i.e., a message flowing through the same edge twice and revisiting the previously visited node. Since the number of message flows increases exponentially with the number of updates, the redundancy in local updates prevents the graph neural network from accurately recognizing a particular message flow relevant for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose to resolve such a redundancy issue via the non-backtracking graph neural network (NBA-GNN) that updates a message without incorporating the message from the previously visited node. We theoretically investigate how NBA-GNN alleviates the over-squashing of GNNs, and establish a connection between NBA-GNN and the impressive performance of non-backtracking updates for stochastic block model recovery. Furthermore, we empirically verify the effectiveness of our NBA-GNN on the long-range graph benchmark and transductive node classification problems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph unlearning techniques often necessitate additional training on the remaining data, leading to significant computational costs, particularly with large-scale graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training-free approach, Erase then Rectify (ETR), designed for efficient and scalable graph unlearning while preserving the model utility. Specifically, we first build a theoretical foundation showing that masking parameters critical for unlearned samples enables effective unlearning. Building on this insight, the Erase stage strategically edits model parameters to eliminate the impact of unlearned samples and their propagated influence on intercorrelated nodes. To further ensure the GNN's utility, the Rectify stage devises a gradient approximation method to estimate the model's gradient on the remaining dataset, which is then used to enhance model performance. Overall, ETR achieves graph unlearning without additional training or full training data access, significantly reducing computational overhead and preserving data privacy. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of ETR in model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning effectiveness, establishing it as a promising solution for real-world graph unlearning challenges.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite their versatility, GNNs face significant challenges in transferability, limiting their utility in real-world applications. Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooks discrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challenges when transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt a well-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural distributions remains an under-explored problem. Taking inspiration from the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in adapting large language models to various domains, we propose GraphLoRA, an effective and parameter-efficient method for transferring well-trained GNNs to diverse graph domains. Specifically, we first propose a Structure-aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy (SMMD) to align divergent node feature distributions across source and target graphs. Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a small trainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structural distribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a structure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance the adaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervision labels. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphLoRA against eleven baselines by tuning only 20% of parameters, even across disparate graph domains. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphLoRA.</p></details> | Under review |

However, these approaches adhere to two distinct yet complementary problem formulations: ranking score regression based on query-webpage pairs, and link prediction within query-webpage bipartite graphs, respectively. While it is possible to pre-train GNNs or Transformers on source datasets and subsequently fine-tune them on sparsely annotated LTR datasets, the distributional shifts between the pair-based and bipartite graph domains present significant challenges in integrating these heterogeneous models into a unified LTR framework at web scale. To address this, we introduce the novel MPGraf model, which leverages a modular and capsule-based pre-training strategy, aiming to cohesively integrate the regression capabilities of Transformers with the link prediction strengths of GNNs. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments to rigorously evaluate the performance of MPGraf.</p></details> |  |

Our model combines graph neural networks and Gaussian processes to create a flexible, efficient, symmetry-aware, translation, and rotation-invariant predictor with inbuilt uncertainty quantification. This predictor is then used as a surrogate for a data-efficient Bayesian Optimization scheme to determine the optimal adsorption positions. This pipeline determines the optimal position of large and complicated clusters with far fewer iterations than current state-of-the-art approaches. Further, it does not rely on hand-crafted features and can be seamlessly employed on any molecule without any alterations. Additionally, the pooling properties of graphs allow for the processing of molecules of different sizes by the same model. This allows the energy prediction of computationally demanding systems by a model trained on comparatively smaller and less expensive ones</p></details> | 17 pages 8 figures |
| **[Logical Characterizations of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with Reals and Floats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14606v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pioneering work from 2019, Barcel\'o and coauthors identified logics that precisely match the expressive power of constant iteration-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) relative to properties definable in first-order logic. In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Massive Activations of Attention Mechanism in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03463v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for effectively modeling data with graph structures. Recently, attention mechanisms have been integrated into GNNs to improve their ability to capture complex patterns. This paper presents the first comprehensive study revealing a critical, unexplored consequence of this integration: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. We introduce a novel method for detecting and analyzing MAs, focusing on edge features in different graph transformer architectures. Our study assesses various GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs based on activation ratio distributions, (3) introducing the Explicit Bias Term (EBT) as a potential countermeasure and exploring it as an adversarial framework to assess models robustness based on the presence or absence of MAs. Our findings highlight the prevalence and impact of attention-induced MAs across different architectures, such as GraphTransformer, GraphiT, and SAN. The study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, model architecture, dataset characteristics, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for developing more robust and reliable graph models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetries and Expressive Requirements for Learning General Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15892v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State symmetries play an important role in planning and generalized planning. In the first case, state symmetries can be used to reduce the size of the search; in the second, to reduce the size of the training set. In the case of general planning, however, it is also critical to distinguish non-symmetric states, i.e., states that represent non-isomorphic relational structures. However, while the language of first-order logic distinguishes non-symmetric states, the languages and architectures used to represent and learn general policies do not. In particular, recent approaches for learning general policies use state features derived from description logics or learned via graph neural networks (GNNs) that are known to be limited by the expressive power of C_2, first-order logic with two variables and counting. In this work, we address the problem of detecting symmetries in planning and generalized planning and use the results to assess the expressive requirements for learning general policies over various planning domains. For this, we map planning states to plain graphs, run off-the-shelf algorithms to determine whether two states are isomorphic with respect to the goal, and run coloring algorithms to determine if C_2 features computed logically or via GNNs distinguish non-isomorphic states. Symmetry detection results in more effective learning, while the failure to detect non-symmetries prevents general policies from being learned at all in certain domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2024) in the Reasoning, Learning, and Decision Making track</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Distillation on Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11798v4)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient real-time traffic prediction is crucial for reducing transportation time. To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs. Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data, we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation, incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores, addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of the teacher, even with the retention of only 3% of network parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphGI:A GNN Explanation Method using Game Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15698v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention and have been extensively utilized across various domains. However, similar to other deep learning models, GNNs are often viewed as black-box models, making it challenging to interpret their prediction mechanisms. Current graph explanation techniques focus on identifying key nodes or edges, attributing the critical data features that drive model predictions. Nevertheless, these features do not independently influence the model's outcomes; rather, they interact with one another to collectively affect predictions. In this work, we propose a novel explanatory method GraphGI, which identifies the coalition with the highest interaction strength and presents it as an explanatory subgraph. Given a trained model and an input graph, our method explains predictions by gradually incorporating significant edges into the selected subgraph. We utilize game-theoretic interaction values to assess the interaction strength after edge additions, ensuring that the newly added edges confer maximum interaction strength to the explanatory subgraph. To enhance computational efficiency, we adopt effective approximation techniques for calculating Shapley values and game-theoretic interaction values. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior fidelity and sparsity, maintaining the interpretability of the results at a comprehensible level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer for Stock Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15662v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have achieved significant success in various time series forecasting tasks. However, due to the lack of explicit and fixed spatial relationships in stock prediction tasks, many STGNNs fail to perform effectively in this domain. While some STGNNs learn spatial relationships from time series, they often lack comprehensiveness. Research indicates that modeling time series using feature changes as tokens reveals entirely different information compared to using time steps as tokens. To more comprehensively extract dynamic spatial information from stock data, we propose a Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer (DPA-STIFormer). DPA-STIFormer models each node via continuous changes in features as tokens and introduces a Double Direction Self-adaptation Fusion mechanism. This mechanism decomposes node encoding into temporal and feature representations, simultaneously extracting different spatial correlations from a double path approach, and proposes a Double-path gating mechanism to fuse these two types of correlation information. Experiments conducted on four stock market datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, validating the model's superior capability in uncovering latent temporal-correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |

The main research work includes: Firstly, based on the experience of predecessors, we selected 29 enterprise financial data indicators, abstracted each indicator as a vertex, deeply analyzed the relationships between the indicators, constructed a similarity matrix of indicators, and used the maximum spanning tree algorithm to achieve the graph structure mapping of enterprises; secondly, in the representation learning phase of the mapped graph, a graph neural network model was built to obtain its embedded representation. The feature vector of each node was expanded to 32 dimensions, and three GraphSAGE operations were performed on the graph, with the results pooled using the Pool operation, and the final output of three feature vectors was averaged to obtain the graph's embedded representation; finally, a classifier was constructed using a two-layer fully connected network to complete the prediction task. Experimental results on real enterprise data show that the model proposed in this paper can well complete the multi-level credit level estimation of enterprises. Furthermore, the tree-structured graph mapping deeply portrays the intrinsic connections of various indicator data of the company, and according to the ROC and other evaluation criteria, the model's classification effect is significant and has good "robustness".</p></details> |  |

However, explaining their decision-making process is challenging due to the complex transformations GNNs perform by aggregating relational information from graph topology. Existing methods for explaining GNNs face key limitations: (1) lack of flexibility in generating explanations at varying levels, (2) difficulty in identifying unique substructures relevant to class differentiation, and (3) little support to ensure the trustworthiness of explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a visual analytics system designed to generate and evaluate multi-level GNN explanations for graph classification tasks. GNNAnatomy uses graphlets, primitive graph substructures, to identify the most critical substructures in a graph class by analyzing the correlation between GNN predictions and graphlet frequencies. These correlations are presented interactively for user-selected group of graphs through our visual analytics system. To further validate top-ranked graphlets, we measure the change in classification confidence after removing each graphlet from the original graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy through case studies on synthetic and real-world graph datasets from sociology and biology domains. Additionally, we compare GNNAnatomy with state-of-the-art explainable GNN methods to showcase its utility and versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotifDisco: Motif Causal Discovery For Time Series Motifs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15219v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call motifs. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify causal relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (motif disco-very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of Motif Causality (MC), inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We also integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for other downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |  |

Currently, many studies consider SLOs as a system resource to be allocated, ensuring QoS meets the SLOs. Existing microservice auto-scaling frameworks that rely on SLO resources often utilize complex and computationally intensive models, requiring significant time and resources to determine appropriate resource allocation. This paper aims to rapidly allocate SLO resources and minimize resource costs while ensuring application QoS meets the SLO requirements in a dynamically changing microservice environment. We propose MSARS, a framework that leverages meta-learning to quickly derive SLO resource allocation strategies and employs reinforcement learning for adaptive scaling of microservice resources. It features three innovative components: First, MSARS uses graph convolutional networks to predict the most suitable SLO resource allocation scheme for the current environment. Second, MSARS utilizes meta-learning to enable the graph neural network to quickly adapt to environmental changes ensuring adaptability in highly dynamic microservice environments. Third, MSARS generates auto-scaling policies for each microservice based on an improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) model. The adaptive auto-scaling policy integrates the SLO resource allocation strategy into the scheduling algorithm to satisfy SLOs. Finally, we compare MSARS with state-of-the-art resource auto-scaling algorithms that utilize neural networks and reinforcement learning, MSARS takes 40% less time to adapt to new environments, 38% reduction of SLO violations, and 8% less resources cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, IEEE ISPA 2024</p></details> |
| **[FastGL: A GPU-Efficient Framework for Accelerating Sampling-Based GNN Training at Large Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14939v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great superiority on non-Euclidean graph data, achieving ground-breaking performance on various graph-related tasks. As a practical solution to train GNN on large graphs with billions of nodes and edges, the sampling-based training is widely adopted by existing training frameworks. However, through an in-depth analysis, we observe that the efficiency of existing sampling-based training frameworks is still limited due to the key bottlenecks lying in all three phases of sampling-based training, i.e., subgraph sample, memory IO, and computation. To this end, we propose FastGL, a GPU-efficient Framework for accelerating sampling-based training of GNN at Large scale by simultaneously optimizing all above three phases, taking into account both GPU characteristics and graph structure. Specifically, by exploiting the inherent overlap within graph structures, FastGL develops the Match-Reorder strategy to reduce the data traffic, which accelerates the memory IO without incurring any GPU memory overhead.

Existing works usually incorporate graph knowledge with conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), resulting in a sequential pipeline that compartmentalizes the encoding processes for textual and graph-based knowledge. This compartmentalization does, however, not fully exploit the contextual interplay between these two types of input knowledge. In this paper, a novel context-aware graph-attention model (Context-aware GAT) is proposed, designed to effectively assimilate global features from relevant knowledge graphs through a context-enhanced knowledge aggregation mechanism. Specifically, the proposed framework employs an innovative approach to representation learning that harmonizes heterogeneous features by amalgamating flattened graph knowledge with text data. The hierarchical application of graph knowledge aggregation within connected subgraphs, complemented by contextual information, to bolster the generation of commonsense-driven dialogues is analyzed. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework outperforms conventional GNN-based language models in terms of performance. Both, automated and human evaluations affirm the significant performance enhancements achieved by our proposed model over the concept flow baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INLG 2024</p></details> |

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted approach, but while advanced techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) have enhanced CF models for better user representations, they often lack the ability to provide explanations for the recommended items. Explainable recommendations aim to address this gap by offering transparency and insights into the recommendation decision-making process, enhancing users' understanding. This work leverages the language capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of explainable recommender systems. We introduce a model-agnostic framework called XRec, which enables LLMs to provide comprehensive explanations for user behaviors in recommender systems. By integrating collaborative signals and designing a lightweight collaborative adaptor, the framework empowers LLMs to understand complex patterns in user-item interactions and gain a deeper understanding of user preferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of XRec, showcasing its ability to generate comprehensive and meaningful explanations that outperform baseline approaches in explainable recommender systems. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/XRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

The high-speed rotating blades provide power by sucking in air and fully combusting, and various defects will inevitably occur, threatening the operation safety of aero-engine. Therefore, regular inspections are essential for such a complex system. However, existing traditional technology which is borescope inspection is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and experience-dependent. To endow this technology with intelligence, a novel superpixel perception graph neural network (SPGNN) is proposed by utilizing a multi-stage graph convolutional network (MSGCN) for feature extraction and superpixel perception region proposal network (SPRPN) for region proposal. First, to capture complex and irregular textures, the images are transformed into a series of patches, to obtain their graph representations. Then, MSGCN composed of several GCN blocks extracts graph structure features and performs graph information processing at graph level. Last but not least, the SPRPN is proposed to generate perceptual bounding boxes by fusing graph representation features and superpixel perception features. Therefore, the proposed SPGNN always implements feature extraction and information transmission at the graph level in the whole SPGNN pipeline, to alleviate the reduction of receptive field and information loss. To verify the effectiveness of SPGNN, we construct a simulated blade dataset with 3000 images. A public aluminum dataset is also used to validate the performances of different methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPGNN has superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a conference paper to International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2024)</p></details> |

While using all the available information can potentially improve on the accuracy of the flow prediction, there has been little attention to the hierarchical relationship between the type of tickets collected from the passengers entering/exiting a station and its resulting passenger flow. To this end, we propose a novel Integrative Prediction Framework with the Hierarchical Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (IPF-HMGNN). The proposed framework consists of three components: initial prediction, task judgment and hierarchical coordination modules. Using the Wuxi, China metro network as an example, we study two prediction approaches (i) traditional prediction approach where the model directly predicts passenger flow at the station, and (ii) hierarchical prediction approach where the prediction of ticket type and station passenger flow are performed simultaneously considering the hierarchical constraints (i.e., the sum of predicted passenger flow per ticket type equals the predicted station aggregated passenger flow). Experimental results indicate that in the traditional prediction approach, our IPF-HMGNN can significantly reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the GNN prediction model by 49.56% and 53.88%, respectively. In the hierarchical prediction approach, IPF-HMGNN can achieve a maximum reduction of 35.32% in MAE and 36.18% in RMSE, while satisfying the hierarchical constraint.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Traffic Flow using Wavelet-based Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04440v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem in the field of machine learning, impacting urban traffic management systems. In general, spatiotemporal forecasting problems involve complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Due to this, traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble method can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make reliable long-term forecasts. In addition to point forecasts, our proposed model can generate interval forecasts that significantly enhance probabilistic forecasting for traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, many of these approaches overlook the crucial role of relation information and inadequately integrate it with entity information, resulting in diminished expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph encoder that incorporates tensor decomposition within the aggregation function of Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN). Our model enhances the representation of neighboring entities by employing projection matrices of a low-rank tensor defined by relation types. This approach facilitates multi-task learning, thereby generating relation-aware representations. Furthermore, we introduce a low-rank estimation technique for the core tensor through CP decomposition, which effectively compresses and regularizes our model. We adopt a training strategy inspired by contrastive learning, which relieves the training limitation of the 1-N method inherent in handling vast graphs. We outperformed all our competitors on two common benchmark datasets, FB15k-237 and WN18RR, while using low-dimensional embeddings for entities and relations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 Tables, 2 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Boolean Product Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14001v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently achieved significant success, with a key operation involving the aggregation of information from neighboring nodes. Substantial researchers have focused on defining neighbors for aggregation, predominantly based on observed adjacency matrices. However, in many scenarios, the explicitly given graphs contain noise, which can be amplified during the messages-passing process. Therefore, many researchers have turned their attention to latent graph inference, specifically learning a parametric graph. To mitigate fluctuations in latent graph structure learning, this paper proposes a novel Boolean product-based graph residual connection in GNNs to link the latent graph and the original graph. It computes the Boolean product between the latent graph and the original graph at each layer to correct the learning process. The Boolean product between two adjacency matrices is equivalent to triangle detection. Accordingly, the proposed Boolean product graph neural networks can be interpreted as discovering triangular cliques from the original and the latent graph. We validate the proposed method in benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to enhance the performance and robustness of GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.10688</p></details> |

A specialized segment within this field focuses on extracting nuanced evaluations tied to particular elements within textual contexts. This research advances a composite framework that amalgamates the positional cues of topical descriptors. The proposed system converts syntactic structures into a matrix format, leveraging convolutions and attention mechanisms within a graph to distill salient characteristics. Incorporating the positional relevance of descriptors relative to lexical items enhances the sequential integrity of the input. Trials have substantiated that this integrated graph-centric scheme markedly elevates the efficacy of evaluative categorization, showcasing preeminence.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Model, Any Conjunctive Query: Graph Neural Networks for Answering Complex Queries over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13959v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional query answering over knowledge graphs -- or broadly over relational data -- is one of the most fundamental problems in data management. Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this work, we propose AnyCQ, a graph neural network model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph, following training. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network model trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Our approach and problem setup differ from existing query answering studies in multiple dimensions. First, we focus on the problem of query answer classification: given a query and a set of possible answers, classify these proposals as true or false relative to the complete knowledge graph. Second, we study the problem of query answer retrieval: given a query, retrieve an answer to the query relative to the complete knowledge graph or decide that no correct solutions exist. Trained on simple, small instances, AnyCQ can generalize to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to samples where existing approaches fail, which is empirically validated on new and challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our AnyCQ models effectively transfer to out-of-distribution knowledge graphs, when equipped with a relevant link predictor, highlighting their potential to serve as a general engine for query answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Simulate Aerosol Dynamics with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13861v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerosol effects on climate, weather, and air quality depend on characteristics of individual particles, which are tremendously diverse and change in time. Particle-resolved models are the only models able to capture this diversity in particle physiochemical properties, and these models are computationally expensive. As a strategy for accelerating particle-resolved microphysics models, we introduce Graph-based Learning of Aerosol Dynamics (GLAD) and use this model to train a surrogate of the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. GLAD implements a Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS), a machine learning framework that has been used to simulate particle-based fluid dynamics models. In GLAD, each particle is represented as a node in a graph, and the evolution of the particle population over time is simulated through learned message passing. We demonstrate our GNS approach on a simple aerosol system that includes condensation of sulfuric acid onto particles composed of sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon, and water. A graph with particles as nodes is constructed, and a graph neural network (GNN) is then trained using the model output from PartMC-MOSAIC. The trained GNN can then be used for simulating and predicting aerosol dynamics over time. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately learn chemical dynamics and generalize across different scenarios, achieving efficient training and prediction times. We evaluate the performance across three scenarios, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability in modeling aerosol microphysics and chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Ordering in Crystalline Materials with Symmetry-Aware Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13851v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become a machine learning workhorse for screening the chemical space of crystalline materials in fields such as catalysis and energy storage, by predicting properties from structures. Multicomponent materials, however, present a unique challenge since they can exhibit chemical (dis)order, where a given lattice structure can encompass a variety of elemental arrangements ranging from highly ordered structures to fully disordered solid solutions. Critically, properties like stability, strength, and catalytic performance depend not only on structures but also on orderings. To enable rigorous materials design, it is thus critical to ensure GCNNs are capable of distinguishing among atomic orderings. However, the ordering-aware capability of GCNNs has been poorly understood. Here, we benchmark various neural network architectures for capturing the ordering-dependent energetics of multicomponent materials in a custom-made dataset generated with high-throughput atomistic simulations. Conventional symmetry-invariant GCNNs were found unable to discern the structural difference between the diverse symmetrically inequivalent atomic orderings of the same material, while symmetry-equivariant model architectures could inherently preserve and differentiate the distinct crystallographic symmetries of various orderings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generative Framework for Predictive Modeling of Multiple Chronic Conditions Using Graph Variational Autoencoder and Bandit-Optimized Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13671v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the emergence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is crucial for early intervention and personalized healthcare, as MCC significantly impacts patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective methods for modeling complex graph data, such as those found in MCC. However, a significant challenge with GNNs is their reliance on an existing graph structure, which is not readily available for MCC. To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative framework for GNNs that constructs a representative underlying graph structure by utilizing the distribution of the data to enhance predictive analytics for MCC. Our framework employs a graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) to capture the complex relationships in patient data. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of individual health trajectories and facilitates the creation of diverse patient stochastic similarity graphs while preserving the original feature set. These variations of patient stochastic similarity graphs, generated from the GVAE decoder, are then processed by a GNN using a novel Laplacian regularization technique to refine the graph structure over time and improves the prediction accuracy of MCC. A contextual Bandit is designed to evaluate the stochastically generated graphs and identify the best-performing graph for the GNN model iteratively until model convergence. We validate the performance of the proposed contextual Bandit algorithm against $\varepsilon$-Greedy and multi-armed Bandit algorithms on a large cohort (n = 1,592) of patients with MCC. These advancements highlight the potential of the proposed approach to transform predictive healthcare analytics, enabling a more personalized and proactive approach to MCC management.</p></details> |  |

Traditional computational methods often struggle with the dynamic nature of these networks. This study explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a powerful approach for modeling graph-structured data like GRNs. Utilizing a Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2), our study presents a novel approach to the construction and interrogation of GRNs, informed by gene expression data and Boolean models derived from literature. The model's adeptness in accurately predicting regulatory interactions and pinpointing key regulators is attributed to advanced attention mechanisms, a hallmark of the GNN framework. These insights suggest that GNNs are primed to revolutionize GRN analysis, addressing traditional limitations and offering richer biological insights. The success of GNNs, as highlighted by our model's reliance on high-quality data, calls for enhanced data collection methods to sustain progress. The integration of GNNs in GRN research is set to pioneer developments in personalized medicine, drug discovery, and our grasp of biological systems, bolstered by the structural analysis of networks for improved node and edge prediction.</p></details> | 24 Pages, 6 Figures |

Despite these successes, their performance, confidence, and trustworthiness are often limited by the inherent randomness of data in nature and the challenges of accurately capturing and modeling real-world complexities. This has increased interest in developing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques tailored to graphical models. In this survey, we comprehensively examine these existing works on UQ in graphical models, focusing on key aspects such as foundational knowledge, sources, representation, handling, and measurement of uncertainty. This survey distinguishes itself from most existing UQ surveys by specifically concentrating on UQ in graphical models, particularly probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). We elaborately categorize recent work into two primary areas: uncertainty representation and uncertainty handling. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, including both established methodologies and emerging trends, we aim to bridge gaps in understanding and highlight key challenges and opportunities in the field. Through in-depth discussion of existing works and promising directions for future research, we believe this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, inspiring them to cope with uncertainty issues in both academic research and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the softmax function lacks spatial information of the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a graph similarity regularized softmax for GNNs in semi-supervised node classification. By incorporating non-local total variation (TV) regularization into the softmax activation function, we can more effectively capture the spatial information inherent in graphs. The weights in the non-local gradient and divergence operators are determined based on the graph's adjacency matrix. We apply the proposed method into the architecture of GCN and GraphSAGE, testing them on citation and webpage linking datasets, respectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate its good performance in node classification and generalization capabilities. These results indicate that the graph similarity regularized softmax is effective on both assortative and disassortative graphs.</p></details> |  |

As post-translational modifications, they modulate protein structure, function, and interactions. Due to their diversity and complexity, predictive models of glycan properties and functions are still insufficient. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed to process and analyze graph-structured data. These architectures leverage the connectivity and relational information in graphs to learn effective representations of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. Iteratively aggregating information from neighboring nodes, GNNs capture complex patterns within graph data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as link prediction or graph classification across domains. This work presents a new model architecture based on combinatorial complexes and higher-order message passing to extract features from glycan structures into a latent space representation. The architecture is evaluated on an improved GlycanML benchmark suite, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. We envision that these improvements will spur further advances in computational glycosciences and reveal the roles of glycans in biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MLSB Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

These tokens are meant to improve the global awareness of link predictions models which, based on graph neural networks, can struggle to capture graph-level features. This lack of ability to feature high level representations is particularly limiting when predicting multiple or entire sets of links. We implement CAM tokens in a simple attention-based link prediction model and in a graph transformer, which we also use in a denoising diffusion framework. A brief introduction to our toy datasets will then be followed by benchmarks which prove that CAM token improve the performance of the model they supplement and outperform a baseline with diverse statistical graph attributes.</p></details> |  |

Although sequence-based transformer models have shown promising results by leveraging the vast amount of protein sequence data in a self-supervised way, there is still a gap in exploiting the available 3D protein structures. In this work, we propose a pre-training scheme going beyond trivial masking methods leveraging 3D and hierarchical structures of proteins. We propose a novel self-supervised method to pretrain 3D graph neural networks on 3D protein structures, by predicting the distances between local geometric centroids of protein subgraphs and the global geometric centroid of the protein. By considering subgraphs and their relationships to the global protein structure, our model can better learn the geometric properties of the protein structure. We experimentally show that our proposed pertaining strategy leads to significant improvements up to 6\%, in the performance of 3D GNNs in various protein classification tasks. Our work opens new possibilities in unsupervised learning for protein graph models while eliminating the need for multiple views, augmentations, or masking strategies which are currently used so far.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Spatial Temporal Prediction Under Data Drift with Informative Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13253v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive spatial temporal prediction can generalize historical data to predict unseen data, crucial for highly dynamic scenarios (e.g., traffic systems, stock markets). However, external events (e.g., urban structural growth, market crash) and emerging new entities (e.g., locations, stocks) can undermine prediction accuracy by inducing data drift over time. Most existing studies extract invariant patterns to counter data drift but ignore pattern diversity, exhibiting poor generalization to unseen entities. To address this issue, we design an Informative Graph Neural Network (INF-GNN) to distill diversified invariant patterns and improve prediction accuracy under data drift. Firstly, we build an informative subgraph with a uniquely designed metric, Relation Importance (RI), that can effectively select stable entities and distinct spatial relationships. This subgraph further generalizes new entities' data via neighbors merging. Secondly, we propose an informative temporal memory buffer to help the model emphasize valuable timestamps extracted using influence functions within time intervals. This memory buffer allows INF-GNN to discern influential temporal patterns. Finally, RI loss optimization is designed for pattern consolidation. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset under substantial data drift demonstrate that INF-GNN significantly outperforms existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</p></details> |  |

HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways. To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MLCAD 2024</p></details> |

These fields naturally use graph data, benefiting from GNNs' message-passing framework. However, the potential of GNNs in more general data representations, especially in the image domain, remains underexplored. Leveraging the manifold hypothesis, which posits that high-dimensional data lies in a low-dimensional manifold, we explore GNNs' potential in this context. We construct an image manifold using variational autoencoders, then sample the manifold to generate graphs where each node is an image. This approach reduces data dimensionality while preserving geometric information. We then train a GNN to predict node labels corresponding to the image labels in the classification task, and leverage convergence of GNNs to manifold neural networks to analyze GNN generalization. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that GNNs generalize effectively to unseen graphs, achieving competitive accuracy in classification tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Gait-based Age Group Classification with Adaptive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00294v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning techniques have recently been utilized for model-free age-associated gait feature extraction. However, acquiring model-free gait demands accurate pre-processing such as background subtraction, which is non-trivial in unconstrained environments. On the other hand, model-based gait can be obtained without background subtraction and is less affected by covariates. For model-based gait-based age group classification problems, present works rely solely on handcrafted features, where feature extraction is tedious and requires domain expertise. This paper proposes a deep learning approach to extract age-associated features from model-based gait for age group classification. Specifically, we first develop an unconstrained gait dataset called Multimedia University Gait Age and Gender dataset (MMU GAG). Next, the body joint coordinates are determined via pose estimation algorithms and represented as compact gait graphs via a novel part aggregation scheme. Then, a Part-AdaptIve Residual Graph Convolutional Neural Network (PairGCN) is designed for age-associated feature learning. Experiments suggest that PairGCN features are far more informative than handcrafted features, yielding up to 99% accuracy for classifying subjects as a child, adult, or senior in the MMU GAG dataset. These results suggest the feasibility of deploying Artificial Intelligence-enabled solutions for access control, surveillance, and law enforcement in unconstrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cloudy with a Chance of Anomalies: Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Early Detection of Cloud Services' User Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12726v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the security of cloud environments is imperative for sustaining organizational growth and operational efficiency. As the ubiquity of cloud services continues to rise, the inevitability of cyber threats underscores the importance of preemptive detection. This paper introduces a pioneering time-based embedding approach for Cloud Services Graph-based Anomaly Detection (CS-GAD), utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to discern anomalous user behavior during interactions with cloud services. Our method employs a dynamic tripartite graph representation to encapsulate the evolving interactions among cloud services, users, and their activities over time. Leveraging GNN models in each time frame, our approach generates a graph embedding wherein each user is assigned a score based on their historical activity, facilitating the identification of unusual behavior. Results demonstrate a notable reduction in false positive rates (2-9%) compared to prevailing methods, coupled with a commendable true positive rate (100%). The contributions of this work encompass early detection capabilities, a low false positive rate, an innovative tripartite graph representation incorporating action types, the introduction of a new cloud services dataset featuring various user attacks, and an open-source implementation for community collaboration in advancing cloud service security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Explainable Reasoning in 6G: A Proof of Concept Study on Radio Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10186v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The move toward artificial intelligence (AI)-native sixth-generation (6G) networks has put more emphasis on the importance of explainability and trustworthiness in network management operations, especially for mission-critical use-cases. Such desired trust transcends traditional post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods to using contextual explanations for guiding the learning process in an in-hoc way. This paper proposes a novel graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework named TANGO which relies on a symbolic subsystem. It consists of a Bayesian-graph neural network (GNN) Explainer, whose outputs, in terms of edge/node importance and uncertainty, are periodically translated to a logical GRL reward function. This adjustment is accomplished through defined symbolic reasoning rules within a Reasoner. Considering a real-world testbed proof-of-concept (PoC), a gNodeB (gNB) radio resource allocation problem is formulated, which aims to minimize under- and over-provisioning of physical resource blocks (PRBs) while penalizing decisions emanating from the uncertain and less important edge-nodes relations. Our findings reveal that the proposed in-hoc explainability solution significantly expedites convergence compared to standard GRL baseline and other benchmarks in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) domain. The experiment evaluates performance in AI, complexity, energy consumption, robustness, network, scalability, and explainability metrics. Specifically, the results show that TANGO achieves a noteworthy accuracy of 96.39% in terms of optimal PRB allocation in inference phase, outperforming the baseline by 1.22x.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables; its conference version was presented at the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2022)</p></details> |
| **[CF-GO-Net: A Universal Distribution Learner via Characteristic Function Networks with Graph Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12610v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models aim to learn the distribution of datasets, such as images, so as to be able to generate samples that statistically resemble real data. However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12519v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most studies focused on information retrieval-based techniques for fault localization, which built representations for bug reports and source code files and matched their semantic vectors through similarity measurement. However, such approaches often ignore some useful information that might help improve localization performance, such as 1) the interaction relationship between bug reports and source code files; 2) the similarity relationship between bug reports; and 3) the co-citation relationship between source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Fault Localization (MACL-IRFL) to learn the above-mentioned relationships for software fault localization. Specifically, we first generate data augmentations from report-code interaction view, report-report similarity view and code-code co-citation view separately, and adopt graph neural network to aggregate the information of bug reports or source code files from the three views in the embedding process. Moreover, we perform contrastive learning across these views. Our design of contrastive learning task will force the bug report representations to encode information shared by report-report and report-code views,and the source code file representations shared by code-code and report-code views, thereby alleviating the noise from auxiliary information. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five open-source Java projects. The results show that our model can improve over the best baseline up to 28.93%, 25.57% and 20.35% on Accuracy@1, MAP and MRR, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention Dual Embedding for Graphs with Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18385v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been highly successful for the node classification task. GNNs typically assume graphs are homophilic, i.e. neighboring nodes are likely to belong to the same class. However, a number of real-world graphs are heterophilic, and this leads to much lower classification accuracy using standard GNNs. In this work, we design a novel GNN which is effective for both heterophilic and homophilic graphs. Our work is based on three main observations. First, we show that node features and graph topology provide different amounts of informativeness in different graphs, and therefore they should be encoded independently and prioritized in an adaptive manner. Second, we show that allowing negative attention weights when propagating graph topology information improves accuracy. Finally, we show that asymmetric attention weights between nodes are helpful. We design a GNN which makes use of these observations through a novel self-attention mechanism. We evaluate our algorithm on real-world graphs containing thousands to millions of nodes and show that we achieve state-of-the-art results compared to existing GNNs. We also analyze the effectiveness of the main components of our design on different graphs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

However, the complexity of traffic networks has rendered traditional machine learning and statistical methods less effective. With the advent of artificial intelligence, deep learning frameworks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields and are now considered highly effective in many areas. Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising deep learning approach within the ITS domain, owing to their robust ability to model graph-structured data and address complex problems. Consequently, there has been increasing scholarly attention to the applications of GNNs in transportation, which have demonstrated excellent performance. Nevertheless, current research predominantly focuses on traffic forecasting, with other ITS domains, such as autonomous vehicles and demand prediction, receiving less attention. This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs across six representative and emerging ITS research areas: traffic forecasting, vehicle control system, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and parking management. We have examined a wide range of graph-related studies from 2018 to 2023, summarizing their methodologies, features, and contributions in detailed tables and lists. Additionally, we identify the challenges of applying GNNs in ITS and propose potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |

However, because these traditional GNNs do not distinguish among various downstream tasks, embeddings embedded by them are not always effective. Intuitively, paths in a graph imply different semantics for different downstream tasks. Inspired by this, we design a novel GNN solution, namely Customized Graph Neural Network with Path Reweighting (CustomGNN for short). Specifically, the proposed CustomGNN can automatically learn the high-level semantics for specific downstream tasks to highlight semantically relevant paths as well to filter out task-irrelevant noises in a graph. Furthermore, we empirically analyze the semantics learned by CustomGNN and demonstrate its ability to avoid the three inherent problems in traditional GNNs, i.e., over-smoothing, poor robustness, and overfitting. In experiments with the node classification task, CustomGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on three standard graph datasets and four large graph datasets. The source code of the proposed CustomGNN is available at \url{https://github.com/cjpcool/CustomGNN}.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</p></details> |  |

However, they are inherently limited to modeling only pairwise interactions, making it difficult to explicitly capture the complexity of systems with $n$-body relations. To address this, topological deep learning has emerged as a promising field for studying and modeling higher-order interactions using various topological domains, such as simplicial and cellular complexes. While these new domains provide powerful representations, they introduce new challenges, such as effectively modeling the interactions among higher-order structures through higher-order MP. Meanwhile, structured state-space sequence models have proven to be effective for sequence modeling and have recently been adapted for graph data by encoding the neighborhood of a node as a sequence, thereby avoiding the MP mechanism. In this work, we propose a novel architecture designed to operate with simplicial complexes, utilizing the Mamba state-space model as its backbone. Our approach generates sequences for the nodes based on the neighboring cells, enabling direct communication between all higher-order structures, regardless of their rank. We extensively validate our model, demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models developed for simplicial complexes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metric-Semantic Factor Graph Generation based on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11972v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationships between geometric structures and semantic concepts is crucial for building accurate models of complex environments. In indoors, certain spatial constraints, such as the relative positioning of planes, remain consistent despite variations in layout. This paper explores how these invariant relationships can be captured in a graph SLAM framework by representing high-level concepts like rooms and walls, linking them to geometric elements like planes through an optimizable factor graph. Several efforts have tackled this issue with add-hoc solutions for each concept generation and with manually-defined factors. This paper proposes a novel method for metric-semantic factor graph generation which includes defining a semantic scene graph, integrating geometric information, and learning the interconnecting factors, all based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). An edge classification network (G-GNN) sorts the edges between planes into same room, same wall or none types. The resulting relations are clustered, generating a room or wall for each cluster. A second family of networks (F-GNN) infers the geometrical origin of the new nodes. The definition of the factors employs the same F-GNN used for the metric attribute of the generated nodes. Furthermore, share the new factor graph with the S-Graphs+ algorithm, extending its graph expressiveness and scene representation with the ultimate goal of improving the SLAM performance. The complexity of the environments is increased to N-plane rooms by training the networks on L-shaped rooms. The framework is evaluated in synthetic and simulated scenarios as no real datasets of the required complex layouts are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have found success in CFD by mapping meshes into images, recent attention has turned to leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for direct mesh processing. This paper introduces a novel model merging Self-Attention with Message Passing in GNNs, achieving a 15\% reduction in RMSE on the well known flow past a cylinder benchmark. Furthermore, a dynamic mesh pruning technique based on Self-Attention is proposed, that leads to a robust GNN-based multigrid approach, also reducing RMSE by 15\%. Additionally, a new self-supervised training method based on BERT is presented, resulting in a 25\% RMSE reduction. The paper includes an ablation study and outperforms state-of-the-art models on several challenging datasets, promising advancements similar to those recently achieved in natural language and image processing.

The relational information contained therein can be leveraged to statistically model graph properties through geometrical deep learning. Graph neural networks employ techniques, such as message-passing layers, to propagate local features through a graph. However, message-passing layers can be computationally expensive when dealing with large and sparse graphs. Graph pooling operators offer the possibility of removing or merging nodes in such graphs, thus lowering computational costs. However, pooling operators that remove nodes cause data loss, and pooling operators that merge nodes are often computationally expensive. We propose a pooling operator that merges nodes so as not to cause data loss but is also conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed pooling operator performs statistically significantly better than edge pool on four popular benchmark datasets while reducing time complexity and the number of trainable parameters by 70.6% on average. Compared to another maximally powerful method named Graph Isomporhic Network, we show that we outperform them on two popular benchmark datasets while reducing the number of learnable parameters on average by 60.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, presented at 21st International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs, AstraZenica Bio & Healthcare award Paper, ECML PKDD 2024 Vilnius</p></details> |

However, TGNNs adopt specialized models (e.g., TGN, TGAT, and APAN ) and require tailored training frameworks (e.g., TGL and ETC). In this paper, we propose TF-TGN, which uses Transformer decoder as the backbone model for TGNN to enjoy Transformer's codebase for efficient training. In particular, Transformer achieves tremendous success for language modeling, and thus the community developed high-performance kernels (e.g., flash-attention and memory-efficient attention) and efficient distributed training schemes (e.g., PyTorch FSDP, DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM). We observe that TGNN resembles language modeling, i.e., the message aggregation operation between chronologically occurring nodes and their temporal neighbors in TGNNs can be structured as sequence modeling. Beside this similarity, we also incorporate a series of algorithm designs including suffix infilling, temporal graph attention with self-loop, and causal masking self-attention to make TF-TGN work. During training, existing systems are slow in transforming the graph topology and conducting graph sampling. As such, we propose methods to parallelize the CSR format conversion and graph sampling. We also adapt Transformer codebase to train TF-TGN efficiently with multiple GPUs. We experiment with 9 graphs and compare with 2 state-of-the-art TGNN training frameworks. The results show that TF-TGN can accelerate training by over 2.20 while providing comparable or even superior accuracy to existing SOTA TGNNs.

However, their applicability is constrained by the dependence on the observed graph structure. To solve this problem, Latent Graph Inference (LGI) is proposed to infer a task-specific latent structure by computing similarity or edge probability of node features and then apply a GNN to produce predictions. Even so, existing approaches neglect the noise from node features, which affects generated graph structure and performance. In this work, we introduce a novel method called Probability Passing to refine the generated graph structure by aggregating edge probabilities of neighboring nodes based on observed graph. Furthermore, we continue to utilize the LGI framework, inputting the refined graph structure and node features into GNNs to obtain predictions. We name the proposed scheme as Probability Passing-based Graph Neural Network (PPGNN). Moreover, the anchor-based technique is employed to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Property Encoder for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11554v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning, particularly using graph neural networks, fundamentally relies on node features. Nevertheless, numerous real-world systems, such as social and biological networks, often lack node features due to various reasons, including privacy concerns, incomplete or missing data, and limitations in data collection. In such scenarios, researchers typically resort to methods like structural and positional encoding to construct node features. However, the length of such features is contingent on the maximum value within the property being encoded, for example, the highest node degree, which can be exceedingly large in applications like scale-free networks. Furthermore, these encoding schemes are limited to categorical data and might not be able to encode metrics returning other type of values. In this paper, we introduce a novel, universally applicable encoder, termed PropEnc, which constructs expressive node embedding from any given graph metric. PropEnc leverages histogram construction combined with reverse index encoding, offering a flexible method for node features initialization. It supports flexible encoding in terms of both dimensionality and type of input, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse applications. PropEnc allows encoding metrics in low-dimensional space which effectively avoids the issue of sparsity and enhances the efficiency of the models. We show that \emph{PropEnc} can construct node features that either exactly replicate one-hot encoding or closely approximate indices under various settings. Our extensive evaluations in graph classification setting across multiple social networks that lack node features support our hypothesis. The empirical results conclusively demonstrate that PropEnc is both an efficient and effective mechanism for constructing node features from diverse set of graph metrics.</p></details> | conference paper |

Specifically, we demonstrate that with increased depth, node representations become dominated by a low-dimensional subspace that depends on the aggregation function but not on the feature transformations. For all aggregation functions, the rank of the node representations collapses, resulting in over-smoothing for particular aggregation functions. Our study emphasizes the importance for future research to focus on rank collapse rather than over-smoothing. Guided by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property that provably prevents over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse. We empirically demonstrate the shortcomings of existing models in fitting target functions of node classification tasks.</p></details> | LoG 2023 |
| **[Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations.</p></details> |  |

Previous works mostly performed uncertainty estimation on pixel-level. In a line of research, a connected-component-wise (segment-wise) perspective was taken, approaching uncertainty estimation on an object-level by performing so-called meta classification and regression to estimate uncertainty and prediction quality, respectively. In those works, each predicted segment is considered individually to estimate its uncertainty or prediction quality. However, the neighboring segments may provide additional hints on whether a given predicted segment is of high quality, which we study in the present work. On the basis of uncertainty indicating metrics on segment-level, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the relationship of a given segment's quality as a function of the given segment's metrics as well as those of its neighboring segments. We compare different GNN architectures and achieve a notable performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, submitted to BMVC "Workshop on Robust Recognition in the Open World" (https://rrow2024.github.io/call-for-papers)</p></details> |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

| **[Can Graph Reordering Speed Up Graph Neural Network Training? An Experimental Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11129v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network capable of learning on graph-structured data. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs is challenging due to iterative aggregations of high-dimensional features from neighboring vertices within sparse graph structures combined with neural network operations. The sparsity of graphs frequently results in suboptimal memory access patterns and longer training time. Graph reordering is an optimization strategy aiming to improve the graph data layout. It has shown to be effective to speed up graph analytics workloads, but its effect on the performance of GNN training has not been investigated yet. The generalization of reordering to GNN performance is nontrivial, as multiple aspects must be considered: GNN hyper-parameters such as the number of layers, the number of hidden dimensions, and the feature size used in the GNN model, neural network operations, large intermediate vertex states, and GPU acceleration. In our work, we close this gap by performing an empirical evaluation of 12 reordering strategies in two state-of-the-art GNN systems, PyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library. Our results show that graph reordering is effective in reducing training time for CPU- and GPU-based training, respectively. Further, we find that GNN hyper-parameters influence the effectiveness of reordering, that reordering metrics play an important role in selecting a reordering strategy, that lightweight reordering performs better for GPU-based than for CPU-based training, and that invested reordering time can in many cases be amortized.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in proceedings of the 51st International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), September 1-5, 2025</p></details> |

This critical issue, rooted in the inherent complexity of both DNNs and underlying spatio-temporal patterns in the graph, calls for innovative solutions. While interpretability concerns in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) mirror those of DNNs, to the best of our knowledge, no notable work has addressed the interpretability of temporal GNNs using a combination of Information Bottleneck (IB) principles and prototype-based methods. Our research introduces a novel approach that uniquely integrates these techniques to enhance the interpretability of temporal graph regression models. The key contributions of our work are threefold: We introduce the \underline{G}raph \underline{IN}terpretability in \underline{T}emporal \underline{R}egression task using \underline{I}nformation bottleneck and \underline{P}rototype (GINTRIP) framework, the first combined application of IB and prototype-based methods for interpretable temporal graph tasks. We derive a novel theoretical bound on mutual information (MI), extending the applicability of IB principles to graph regression tasks. We incorporate an unsupervised auxiliary classification head, fostering multi-task learning and diverse concept representation, which enhances the model bottleneck's interpretability. Our model is evaluated on real-world traffic datasets, outperforming existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and interpretability-related metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Contrasformer: A Brain Network Contrastive Transformer for Neurodegenerative Condition Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10944v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding neurological disorder is a fundamental problem in neuroscience, which often requires the analysis of brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Despite the prevalence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers in various domains, applying them to brain networks faces challenges. Specifically, the datasets are severely impacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and the neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of disease-specific patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer. It generates a prior-knowledge-enhanced contrast graph to address the distribution shifts across sub-populations by a two-stream attention mechanism. A cross attention with identity embedding highlights the identity of nodes, and three auxiliary losses ensure group consistency. Evaluated on 4 functional brain network datasets over 4 different diseases, Contrasformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain networks by achieving up to 10.8\% improvement in accuracy, which demonstrates its efficacy in neurological disorder identification. Case studies illustrate its interpretability, especially in the context of neuroscience. This paper provides a solution for analyzing brain networks, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders.

| **[ES-GNN: Generalizing Graph Neural Networks Beyond Homophily with Edge Splitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13700v5)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved enormous success in multiple graph analytical tasks, modern variants mostly rely on the strong inductive bias of homophily. However, real-world networks typically exhibit both homophilic and heterophilic linking patterns, wherein adjacent nodes may share dissimilar attributes and distinct labels. Therefore, GNNs smoothing node proximity holistically may aggregate both task-relevant and irrelevant (even harmful) information, limiting their ability to generalize to heterophilic graphs and potentially causing non-robustness. In this work, we propose a novel Edge Splitting GNN (ES-GNN) framework to adaptively distinguish between graph edges either relevant or irrelevant to learning tasks. This essentially transfers the original graph into two subgraphs with the same node set but complementary edge sets dynamically. Given that, information propagation separately on these subgraphs and edge splitting are alternatively conducted, thus disentangling the task-relevant and irrelevant features. Theoretically, we show that our ES-GNN can be regarded as a solution to a disentangled graph denoising problem, which further illustrates our motivations and interprets the improved generalization beyond homophily. Extensive experiments over 11 benchmark and 1 synthetic datasets not only demonstrate the effective performance of ES-GNN but also highlight its robustness to adversarial graphs and mitigation of the over-smoothing problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Graph Transformer Network for Multiple Fault Localization in Naval Shipboard Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10792v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of power electronics building blocks in modern MVDC 12kV Naval ship systems enhances energy management and functionality but also introduces complex fault detection and control challenges. These challenges strain traditional fault diagnostic methods, making it difficult to detect and manage faults across multiple locations while maintaining system stability and performance. This paper proposes a temporal recurrent graph transformer network for fault diagnosis in naval MVDC 12kV shipboard systems. The deep graph neural network uses gated recurrent units to capture temporal features and a multi-head attention mechanism to extract spatial features, enhancing diagnostic accuracy. The approach effectively identifies and evaluates successive multiple faults with high precision. The method is implemented and validated on the MVDC 12kV shipboard system designed by the ESDRC team, incorporating all key components. Results show significant improvements in fault localization accuracy, with a 1-4% increase in performance metrics compared to other machine learning methods.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Foundation Models to the Rescue: Deadlock Resolution in Connected Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06413v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connected multi-agent robotic systems (MRS) are prone to deadlocks in an obstacle environment where the robots can get stuck away from their desired locations under a smooth low-level control policy. Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, a low-level control policy cannot resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of foundation models, this paper explores the possibility of using text-based models, i.e., large language models (LLMs), and text-and-image-based models, i.e., vision-language models (VLMs), as high-level planners for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where a foundation model-based high-level planner helps to resolve deadlocks by assigning a leader to the MRS along with a set of waypoints for the MRS leader. Then, a low-level distributed control policy based on graph neural networks is executed to safely follow these waypoints, thereby evading the deadlock. We conduct extensive experiments on various MRS environments using the best available pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. We compare their performance with a graph-based planner in terms of effectiveness in helping the MRS reach their target locations and computational time. Our results illustrate that, compared to grid-based planners, the foundation models perform better in terms of the goal-reaching rate and computational time for complex environments, which helps us conclude that foundation models can assist MRS operating in complex obstacle-cluttered environments to resolve deadlocks efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper introduces RTop-K, a highly efficient parallel row-wise top-k selection algorithm designed for GPUs. RTop-K employs a Binary Search-based approach to optimize resource allocation and provides a scalable solution that significantly accelerates top-k operations. We perform a theoretical analysis of the effects of early stopping in our algorithm, demonstrating that it maintains the accuracy of neural network models while enhancing performance. Comprehensive tests show that our GPU implementation of RTop-K outperforms other row-wise top-k GPU implementations, with minimal impact on testing accuracy when early stopping is applied. Notably, RTop-K achieves speed increases ranging from 4.245$\times$ to 9.506$\times$ with early stopping, and 3.936$\times$ without early stopping, compared to state-of-the-art implementations. The proposed methods offer significant improvements in the training and inference of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing critical challenges in latency and throughput on GPU platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve the experiment part</p></details> |

These limitations restrict the practical deployment of GNNs, notably in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, this study introduce <b>Point<\b> <b>Vi<\b>sion <b>G<\b>NN (PointViG), an efficient framework for point cloud analysis. PointViG incorporates a lightweight graph convolutional module to efficiently aggregate local features and mitigate over-smoothing. For large-scale point cloud scenes, we propose an adaptive dilated graph convolution technique that searches for sparse neighboring nodes within a dilated neighborhood based on semantic correlation, thereby expanding the receptive field and ensuring computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that PointViG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while balancing performance and complexity. On the ModelNet40 classification task, PointViG achieved 94.3% accuracy with 1.5M parameters. For the S3DIS segmentation task, it achieved an mIoU of 71.7% with 5.3M parameters. These results underscore the potential and efficiency of PointViG in point cloud analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperedge Modeling in Hypergraph Neural Networks by using Densest Overlapping Subgraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10340v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs tackle the limitations of traditional graphs by introducing {\em hyperedges}. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges. Also, the underlying message-passing mechanisms in Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are in the form of vertex-hyperedge-vertex, which let HGNNs capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). More recently, the idea of overlapping subgraphs has emerged. These subgraphs can capture more information about subgroups of vertices without limiting one vertex belonging to just one group, allowing vertices to belong to multiple groups or subgraphs. In addition, one of the most important problems in graph clustering is to find densest overlapping subgraphs (DOS). In this paper, we propose a solution to the DOS problem via Agglomerative Greedy Enumeration (DOSAGE) algorithm as a novel approach to enhance the process of generating the densest overlapping subgraphs and, hence, a robust construction of the hypergraphs. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that the DOSAGE algorithm significantly outperforms the HGNNs and six other methods on the node classification task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Spatially Adaptive Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09071v5)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we establish a theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency among nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our proposed SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Parkinsons Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07884v3)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promising performance of state of the art approaches for Parkinsons Disease (PD) detection, these approaches often analyze individual speech segments in isolation, which can lead to suboptimal results. Dysarthric cues that characterize speech impairments from PD patients are expected to be related across segments from different speakers. Isolated segment analysis fails to exploit these inter segment relationships. Additionally, not all speech segments from PD patients exhibit clear dysarthric symptoms, introducing label noise that can negatively affect the performance and generalizability of current approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel PD detection framework utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By representing speech segments as nodes and capturing the similarity between segments through edges, our GCN model facilitates the aggregation of dysarthric cues across the graph, effectively exploiting segment relationships and mitigating the impact of label noise. Experimental results demonstrate theadvantages of the proposed GCN model for PD detection and provide insights into its underlying mechanisms</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

With the great success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been widely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations simultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on argeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform untargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct malicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack performance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is challenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this limitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading recommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework MultiAttack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the generation of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for conducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM TOIS |

Deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology, including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparison. We further discuss multiple open problems to inspire more future high-quality research.
