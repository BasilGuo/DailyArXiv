| **[The broader spectrum of in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03782v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit $\unicode{x2014}$ such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[SigKAN: Signature-Weighted Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17890v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach that enhances multivariate function approximation using learnable path signatures and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs). We enhance the learning capabilities of these networks by weighting the values obtained by KANs using learnable path signatures, which capture important geometric features of paths. This combination allows for a more comprehensive and flexible representation of sequential and temporal data. We demonstrate through studies that our SigKANs with learnable path signatures perform better than conventional methods across a range of function approximation challenges. By leveraging path signatures in neural networks, this method offers intriguing opportunities to enhance performance in time series analysis and time series forecasting, among other fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.07344, arXiv:2406.02486</p></details> |
| **[Deep learning for predicting the occurrence of tipping points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18693v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tipping points occur in many real-world systems, at which the system shifts suddenly from one state to another. The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF) for Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14599v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) models can generate high-quality samples from a non-informative prior, but they can be slow, often needing hundreds of network evaluations (NFE). To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation, where we achieve likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.\href{https://github.com/MrRezaeiUofT/IDFF}{Github Repository}</p></details> |  |
| **[Food for thought: How can machine learning help better predict and understand changes in food prices?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06472v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address a lack of systematic understanding of fluctuations in food affordability in Canada. Canada's Food Price Report (CPFR) is an annual publication that predicts food inflation over the next calendar year. The published predictions are a collaborative effort between forecasting teams that each employ their own approach at Canadian Universities: Dalhousie University, the University of British Columbia, the University of Saskatchewan, and the University of Guelph/Vector Institute. While the University of Guelph/Vector Institute forecasting team has leveraged machine learning (ML) in previous reports, the most recent editions (2024--2025) have also included a human-in-the-loop approach. For the 2025 report, this focus was expanded to evaluate several different data-centric approaches to improve forecast accuracy. In this study, we evaluate how different types of forecasting models perform when estimating food price fluctuations. We also examine the sensitivity of models that curate time series data representing key factors in food pricing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data on Human Gesture Recognition Tasks Using GANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06389v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is an emerging interest in employing Deep Generative Models (DGMs) to address data scarcity, enhance data quality, and improve classification metrics scores. Among these types of models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have arisen as a powerful tool for generating synthetic data that mimic real-world scenarios with high fidelity. However, Human Gesture Recognition (HGR), a subset of HAR, particularly in healthcare applications, using time series data such as allergic gestures, remains highly unexplored. In this paper, we examine and evaluate the performance of two GANs in the generation of synthetic gesture motion data that compose a part of an open-source benchmark dataset. The data is related to the disease identification domain and healthcare, specifically to allergic rhinitis. We also focus on these AI models' performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, and privacy. Furthermore, we examine the scenario if the synthetic data can substitute real data, in training scenarios and how well models trained on synthetic data can be generalized for the allergic rhinitis gestures. In our work, these gestures are related to 6-axes accelerometer and gyroscope data, serving as multi-variate time series instances, and retrieved from smart wearable devices. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the feasibility of synthesizing motion gestures for allergic rhinitis from wearable IoT device data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and testing their impact on the generalization of gesture recognition systems. It is worth noting that, even if our method has been applied to a specific category of gestures, it is designed to be generalized and can be deployed also to other motion data in the HGR domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Pre-training Data Quality without Labels for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06368v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models that generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation models is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to collect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the performance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of the data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new measure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the foundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the proposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream tasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to search for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve thereby the foundation model's generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spiking Neural Networks for Radio Frequency Interference Detection in Radio Astronomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06124v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient spatio-temporal data processing owing to their dynamic nature. This paper addresses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by reformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN execution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and network parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background information, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) instrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real radio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of SNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

| **[PowerMamba: A Deep State Space Model and Comprehensive Benchmark for Time Series Prediction in Electric Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06112v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electricity sector is undergoing substantial transformations due to the rising electrification of demand, enhanced integration of renewable energy resources, and the emergence of new technologies. These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the Journal of IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Forecasting with LLMs: Understanding and Enhancing Model Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10835v4)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in many fields and have developed rapidly in recent years. As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</p></details> |
| **[Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Zero-Shot Table Understanding via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737v2)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transportation Marketplace Rate Forecast Using Signature Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04857v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight transportation marketplace rates are typically challenging to forecast accurately. In this work, we have developed a novel statistical technique based on signature transforms and have built a predictive and adaptive model to forecast these marketplace rates. Our technique is based on two key elements of the signature transform: one being its universal nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and hence translates the forecasting problem into linear regression, and the other being the signature kernel, which allows for comparing computationally efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon trucking operations, with far superior forecast accuracy and better interpretability versus commercially available industry models, even during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, our technique is able to capture the influence of business cycles and the heterogeneity of the marketplace, improving prediction accuracy by more than fivefold, with an estimated annualized saving of \$50MM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Functional Graphical Models with Change-Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03041v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional data analysis, which models data as realizations of random functions over a continuum, has emerged as a useful tool for time series data. Often, the goal is to infer the dynamic connections (or time-varying conditional dependencies) among multiple functions or time series. For this task, a dynamic and Bayesian functional graphical model is introduced. The proposed modeling approach prioritizes the careful definition of an appropriate graph to identify both time-invariant and time-varying connectivity patterns. A novel block-structured sparsity prior is paired with a finite basis expansion, which together yield effective shrinkage and graph selection with efficient computations via a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Crucially, the model includes (one or more) graph changepoints, which are learned jointly with all model parameters and incorporate graph dynamics. Simulation studies demonstrate excellent graph selection capabilities, with significant improvements over competing methods. The proposed approach is applied to study of dynamic connectivity patterns of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and reveals meaningful edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised for Computational Statistics and Data Analysis</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Model for Subsurface Well Logs Prediction and Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05681v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise in energy demand highlights the importance of suitable subsurface storage, requiring detailed and accurate subsurface characterization often reliant on high-quality borehole well log data. However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin. In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%. The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.</p></details> |  |

While the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm performs dynamic smoothing based on local variation in a periodogram, the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm performs dynamic smoothing based on local departure from linearity in a periodogram. This article begins with a summary of the statistical foundations for both the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm and the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm, followed by instructions for accessing and utilizing these approaches within the R statistical program platform. Brief definitions, importance, statistical bases, theoretical and practical limits, and demonstrations are provided for their sensitivity, accuracy, resolution, and robustness in estimating signal frequencies. Next using a simulated time series in which two signals close in frequency are embedded in a significant level of random noise, the predictive power of these approaches are compared to the autoregressive integral moving average (ARIMA) approach, with support again garnered for their being robust when data is missing. Throughout, the article contrasts the limits of Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing to those of log-periodograms with static smoothing, while also comparing the performance of the DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm to that of the Neagu-Zurbenko algorithm. It concludes by delineating next steps to establish the precision with which Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing estimate signal strength.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 5 figures; updated title, expanded focus to dynamic smoothing with commensurate results, included comparisons to static smoothing limits</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Auto-regressive Transformer for Effective Self-supervised Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05711v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has become a popular and effective approach for enhancing time series forecasting, enabling models to learn universal representations from unlabeled data. However, effectively capturing both the global sequence dependence and local detail features within time series data remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel generative self-supervised method called TimeDART, denoting Diffusion Auto-regressive Transformer for Time series forecasting. In TimeDART, we treat time series patches as basic modeling units. Specifically, we employ an self-attention based Transformer encoder to model the dependencies of inter-patches. Additionally, we introduce diffusion and denoising mechanisms to capture the detail locality features of intra-patch. Notably, we design a cross-attention-based denoising decoder that allows for adjustable optimization difficulty in the self-supervised task, facilitating more effective self-supervised pre-training. Furthermore, the entire model is optimized in an auto-regressive manner to obtain transferable representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeDART achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance compared to the most advanced competitive methods in forecasting tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Melmaphother/TimeDART.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A New Perspective on Time Series Anomaly Detection: Faster Patch-based Broad Learning System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05498v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a research hotspot in both academia and industry in recent years. Deep learning methods have become the mainstream research direction due to their excellent performance. However, new viewpoints have emerged in recent TSAD research. Deep learning is not required for TSAD due to limitations such as slow deep learning speed. The Broad Learning System (BLS) is a shallow network framework that benefits from its ease of optimization and speed. It has been shown to outperform machine learning approaches while remaining competitive with deep learning. Based on the current situation of TSAD, we propose the Contrastive Patch-based Broad Learning System (CPatchBLS). This is a new exploration of patching technique and BLS, providing a new perspective for TSAD. We construct Dual-PatchBLS as a base through patching and Simple Kernel Perturbation (SKP) and utilize contrastive learning to capture the differences between normal and abnormal data under different representations. To compensate for the temporal semantic loss caused by various patching, we propose CPatchBLS with model level integration, which takes advantage of BLS's fast feature to build model-level integration and improve model detection. Using five real-world series anomaly detection datasets, we confirmed the method's efficacy, outperforming previous deep learning and machine learning methods while retaining a high level of computing efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, Under review</p></details> |

While Transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies, their application to extended sequences is limited by computational inefficiencies and limited generalization. In this study, we propose KEDformer, a knowledge extraction-driven framework that integrates seasonal-trend decomposition to address these challenges. KEDformer leverages knowledge extraction methods that focus on the most informative weights within the self-attention mechanism to reduce computational overhead. Additionally, the proposed KEDformer framework decouples time series into seasonal and trend components. This decomposition enhances the model's ability to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term patterns. Extensive experiments on five public datasets from energy, transportation, and weather domains demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of KEDformer, providing an efficient solution for long-term time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Based Deep Learning for Time-Efficient Inverse Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05403v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate understanding of muscle activation and muscle forces plays an essential role in neuro-rehabilitation and musculoskeletal disorder treatments. Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, Journal paper</p></details> |

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Wavelet-based Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05244v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to best develop foundational models for time series forecasting remains an important open question. Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this effort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential input? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based tokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the space of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the input time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and finally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the forecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs, wavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting that simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark, including 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that WaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models for forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and performs on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically on each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities, achieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary metrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex temporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent pre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time series with varying frequencies evolving over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Evaluation of post-hoc interpretability methods in time-series classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05656v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-hoc interpretability methods are critical tools to explain neural-network results. Several post-hoc methods have emerged in recent years, but when applied to a given task, they produce different results, raising the question of which method is the most suitable to provide correct post-hoc interpretability. To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential. However, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks which hinders the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work, we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods in particular in time series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely dependence on human judgement, retraining, and shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We additionally design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity. The proposed methodology and quantitative metrics can be used to understand the reliability of interpretability methods results obtained in practical applications. In turn, they can be embedded within operational workflows in critical fields that require accurate interpretability results for e.g., regulatory policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version to match published version in Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

The proposed test statistic is based on the weighted periodogram operator, assuming that the elements of the spectral density operator family are invariant with respect to the group of isometries of the manifold. A Central Limit Theorem is derived to obtain the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the proposed test statistics operator under the null hypothesis. The rate of convergence to zero, in the Hilbert--Schmidt operator norm, of the bias of the integrated empirical second and fourth order cumulant spectral density operators is established under the alternative hypothesis. The consistency of the test is then derived, from the obtained consistency of the integrated weighted periodogram operator under LRD. Practical implementation of our testing approach is based on the random projection methodology. The frequency-varying Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion of invariant Gaussian random spectral Hilbert-Schmidt kernels on manifolds is considered for generation of random directions in the implementation of this methodology. A simulation study illustrates the main results regarding asymptotic normality and consistency, and the empirical size and power properties of the proposed testing approach.</p></details> | No comments |
| **[Assessing Similarity Measures for the Evaluation of Human-Robot Motion Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04820v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key area of research in Human-Robot Interaction is solving the human-robot correspondence problem, which asks how a robot can learn to reproduce a human motion demonstration when the human and robot have different dynamics and kinematic structures. Evaluating these correspondence problem solutions often requires the use of qualitative surveys that can be time consuming to design and administer. Additionally, qualitative survey results vary depending on the population of survey participants. In this paper, we propose the use of heterogeneous time-series similarity measures as a quantitative evaluation metric for evaluating motion correspondence to complement these qualitative surveys. To assess the suitability of these measures, we develop a behavioral cloning-based motion correspondence model, and evaluate it with a qualitative survey as well as quantitative measures. By comparing the resulting similarity scores with the human survey results, we identify Gromov Dynamic Time Warping as a promising quantitative measure for evaluating motion correspondence.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small twolayer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture. This study underscores the potential of RFI detection as a benchmark problem for SNN researchers, emphasizing the efficacy of SNNs in addressing complex time-series segmentation tasks in radio astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

| **[An Efficient Model Maintenance Approach for MLOps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04657v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, many industries have utilized machine learning models (ML) in their systems. Ideally, machine learning models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to data and concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up to date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource intensive, costly, time consuming, and model dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent retraining. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on four time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the performance of models while significantly reducing maintenance time and costs. Our model reuse approach achieves ML performance comparable to the best baseline, while being 15 times more efficient in terms of computation time and costs. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain the performance of their ML models in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 Pa...</summary><p>34 Pages, 25 Figures, 12 Tables, 1 Algorithm, Submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Some PNAs have also shown emergent domain wall dynamics. Previous works have demonstrated methods to physically probe these magnetization dynamics of PNAs to realize neuromorphic reservoir systems that exhibit chaotic dynamical behavior and high-dimensional nonlinearity. These PNA reservoir systems from prior works leverage echo state properties and linear/nonlinear short-term memory of component reservoir nodes to map and preserve the dynamical information of the input time-series data into nondelay spatial embeddings. Such mappings enable these PNA reservoir systems to imitate and predict/forecast the input time series data. However, these prior PNA reservoir systems are based solely on the nondelay spatial embeddings obtained at component reservoir nodes. As a result, they require a massive number of component reservoir nodes, or a very large spatial embedding (i.e., high-dimensional spatial embedding) per reservoir node, or both, to achieve acceptable imitation and prediction accuracy. These requirements reduce the practical feasibility of such PNA reservoir systems. To address this shortcoming, we present a mixed delay/nondelay embeddings-based PNA reservoir system. Our system uses a single PNA reservoir node with the ability to obtain a mixture of delay/nondelay embeddings of the dynamical information of the time-series data applied at the input of a single PNA reservoir node. Our analysis shows that when these mixed delay/nondelay embeddings are used to train a perceptron at the output layer, our reservoir system outperforms existing PNA-based reservoir systems for the imitation of NARMA 2, NARMA 5, NARMA 7, and NARMA 10 time series data, and for the short-term and long-term prediction of the Mackey Glass time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving High-dimensional Inverse Problems Using Amortized Likelihood-free Inference with Noisy and Incomplete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04565v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel likelihood-free probabilistic inversion method based on normalizing flows for high-dimensional inverse problems. The proposed method is comprised of two complementary networks: a summary network for data compression, and an inference network for parameter estimation. The summary network encodes raw observations into a fixed-size vector of summary statistics, while the inference network generates samples of the approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters based on these summary statistics. The posterior samples are produced in a deep generative fashion by sampling from a latent Gaussian distribution and passing these samples through an invertible transformation. We construct this invertible transformation by sequentially alternating conditional invertible neural network (cINN) and conditional neural spline flow (cNSF) layers. The summary and inference networks are trained simultaneously. We apply the proposed method to an inversion problem in groundwater hydrology to estimate the posterior distribution of the system's log-conductivity field conditioned on spatially sparse time-series observations of the system's hydraulic head responses. The conductivity field is represented with 706 degrees of freedom in the considered problem. The comparison with the likelihood-based iterative ensemble smoother PEST-IES method demonstrates that the proposed method accurately estimates the parameter posterior distribution and the observations' predictive posterior distribution at a fraction of the inference time of PEST-IES.</p></details> |  |

This paper studies machine learning that detect drifts in process curve datasets. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning algorithms for process drift detection. An evaluation score, called the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated with the introduced framework is presented that shows that existing algorithms often struggle with datasets containing multiple drift segments.</p></details> |  |

Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method called Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR) addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outranks the other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel and open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact: Exploring Space-Time Perceptive Clues for Weakly Supervised Satellite Image Time Series Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03968v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated crop mapping through Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) has emerged as a crucial avenue for agricultural monitoring and management. However, due to the low resolution and unclear parcel boundaries, annotating pixel-level masks is exceptionally complex and time-consuming in SITS. This paper embraces the weakly supervised paradigm (i.e., only image-level categories available) to liberate the crop mapping task from the exhaustive annotation burden. The unique characteristics of SITS give rise to several challenges in weakly supervised learning: (1) noise perturbation from spatially neighboring regions, and (2) erroneous semantic bias from anomalous temporal periods. To address the above difficulties, we propose a novel method, termed exploring space-time perceptive clues (Exact). First, we introduce a set of spatial clues to explicitly capture the representative patterns of different crops from the most class-relative regions. Besides, we leverage the temporal-to-class interaction of the model to emphasize the contributions of pivotal clips, thereby enhancing the model perception for crop regions. Build upon the space-time perceptive clues, we derive the clue-based CAMs to effectively supervise the SITS segmentation network. Our method demonstrates impressive performance on various SITS benchmarks. Remarkably, the segmentation network trained on Exact-generated masks achieves 95% of its fully supervised performance, showing the bright promise of weakly supervised paradigm in crop mapping scenario. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. Code will be available at https://github.com/MiSsU-HH/Exact</p></details> |

For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |

Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a foundational time-series model from multi-domain time-series datasets: extracting semantically useful tokenized inputs to the model across heterogenous time-series from different domains. We propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) that introduces a novel method of adaptive segmentation that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy during pre-training. This enables LPTM to perform similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model when fine-tuned to different downstream time-series analysis tasks and under zero-shot settings.

To identify conditional correlation structures under varying market conditions and accommodate stylized facts embedded in financial time series, we rely upon the generalized hyperbolic family of distributions with time-dependent parameters evolving according to a latent Markov chain. We exploit its location-scale mixture representation to build a penalized EM algorithm for estimating the state-specific sparse precision matrices by means of an $L_1$ penalty. The proposed approach leads to regime-specific conditional correlation graphs that allow us to identify different degrees of network connectivity of returns over time. The methodology's effectiveness is validated through simulation exercises under different scenarios. In the empirical analysis we apply our model to daily returns of a large set of market indexes, cryptocurrencies and commodity futures over the period 2017-2023.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths.

In these cases, when multiple incoherent base forecasts for each individual variable are available, a forecast combination-and-reconciliation approach, that we call coherent forecast combination, may be used to improve the accuracy of the base forecasts and achieve coherence in the final result. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based technique that combines multiple unbiased base forecasts while assuring the constraints valid for the series. We present closed form expressions for the coherent combined forecast vector and its error covariance matrix in the general case where a different number of forecasts is available for each variable. We also discuss practical issues related to the covariance matrix that is part of the optimal solution. Through simulations and a forecasting experiment on the daily Australian electricity generation hierarchical time series, we show that the proposed methodology, in addition to adhering to sound statistical principles, may yield in significant improvement on base forecasts, single-task combination and single-expert reconciliation approaches as well.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models have demonstrated remarkable transfer capabilities across various domains, their effectiveness in handling individual-specific physiological signals - crucial for precision medicine - remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a systematic pipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer capabilities in medical contexts. Our pipeline employs a three-stage approach. First, it leverages physiological simulation software to generate diverse, clinically relevant scenarios, particularly focusing on data-scarce medical conditions. This simulation-based approach enables both targeted capability assessment and subsequent model fine-tuning. Second, the pipeline projects these simulated signals through the foundation model to obtain embeddings, which are then evaluated using linear methods. This evaluation quantifies the model's ability to capture three critical aspects: physiological feature independence, temporal dynamics preservation, and medical scenario differentiation. Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through specific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the Moirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in physiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal dynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination. These findings suggest that current foundation models may require substantial architectural modifications or targeted fine-tuning before deployment in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the precision medicine workshop at the AI in Medicine conference (2024) in Salt Lake City</p></details> |

Despite an abundance of research on NAS for images and natural language applications, similar studies for time series data are lacking. Among NAS search spaces, chain-structured are the simplest and most applicable to small datasets like time series. We compare three popular NAS strategies on chain-structured search spaces: Bayesian optimization (specifically Tree-structured Parzen Estimator), the hyperband method, and reinforcement learning in the context of financial time series forecasting. These strategies were employed to optimize simple well-understood neural architectures like the MLP, 1D CNN, and RNN, with more complex temporal fusion transformers (TFT) and their own optimizers included for comparison. We find Bayesian optimization and the hyperband method performing best among the strategies, and RNN and 1D CNN best among the architectures, but all methods were very close to each other with a high variance due to the difficulty of working with financial datasets. We discuss our approach to overcome the variance and provide implementation recommendations for future users and researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the paper published in International Journal of Data Science and Analytics</p></details> |

The bank stability index is an important indicator to measure the health status and risk resistance of financial institutions. Traditional prediction methods are difficult to adapt to complex market changes because they rely on single-dimensional macroeconomic data. This paper proposes a prediction framework based on the Time Series Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism of the model to capture the complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships in financial data. Through experiments, we compare the model with LSTM, GRU, CNN, TCN and RNN-Transformer models. The experimental results show that the Time Series Transformer model outperforms other models in both mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) evaluation indicators, showing strong prediction ability. This shows that the Time Series Transformer model can better handle multidimensional time series data in bank stability prediction, providing new technical approaches and solutions for financial risk management.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

However, facing the challenge of across-domain modeling, existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a Unified Time Series Diffusion (UTSD) model is established for the first time to model the multi-domain probability distribution, utilizing the powerful probability distribution modeling ability of Diffusion. Unlike the autoregressive models that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the historical sequence, we use a diffusion denoising process to model the mixture distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed UTSD contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) The diffusion and denoising process on the actual sequence space, combined with the improved classifier free guidance as the conditional generation strategy, greatly improves the stability and accuracy of the downstream task. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, and the pre-trained UTSD outperforms existing foundation models on all data domains, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization ability.

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We view SCR as providing in their state space feature representations of the input-driving time series. By endowing the state space with the canonical dot-product, we ``reverse engineer" the corresponding kernel (inner product) operating in the original time series space. The action of this time-series kernel is fully characterized by the eigenspace of the corresponding metric tensor. We demonstrate that when linear SCRs are constructed at the edge of stability, the eigenvectors of the time-series kernel align with the Fourier basis. This theoretical insight is supported by numerical experiments.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Higher Order Transformers: Efficient Attention Mechanism for Tensor Structured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02919v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are now ubiquitous for sequence modeling tasks, but their extension to multi-dimensional data remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of the attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose Higher-Order Transformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data with more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the computational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we introduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the attention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in the total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT leverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This strategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention computation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive performance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing its potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.</p></details> |  |

However, identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimental data remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In this study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an Integral Square Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99 for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamic equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian inference on the order of stationary vector autoregressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05708v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector autoregressions (VARs) are a widely used tool for modelling multivariate time-series. It is common to assume a VAR is stationary; this can be enforced by imposing the stationarity condition which restricts the parameter space of the autoregressive coefficients to the stationary region. However, implementing this constraint is difficult due to the complex geometry of the stationary region. Fortunately, recent work has provided a solution for autoregressions of fixed order $p$ based on a reparameterization in terms of a set of interpretable and unconstrained transformed partial autocorrelation matrices. In this work, focus is placed on the difficult problem of allowing $p$ to be unknown, developing a prior and computational inference that takes full account of order uncertainty. Specifically, the multiplicative gamma process is used to build a prior which encourages increasing shrinkage of the partial autocorrelations with increasing lag. Identifying the lag beyond which the partial autocorrelations become equal to zero then determines $p$. Based on classic time-series theory, a principled choice of truncation criterion identifies whether a partial autocorrelation matrix is effectively zero. Posterior inference utilizes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via Stan. The work is illustrated in a substantive application to neural activity data to investigate ultradian brain rhythms.</p></details> |  |

Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub.

| **[LLMForecaster: Improving Seasonal Event Forecasts with Unstructured Textual Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02525v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern time-series forecasting models often fail to make full use of rich unstructured information about the time series themselves. This lack of proper conditioning can lead to obvious model failures; for example, models may be unaware of the details of a particular product, and hence fail to anticipate seasonal surges in customer demand in the lead up to major exogenous events like holidays for clearly relevant products. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces a novel forecast post-processor -- which we call LLMForecaster -- that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) to incorporate unstructured semantic and contextual information and historical data to improve the forecasts from an existing demand forecasting pipeline. In an industry-scale retail application, we demonstrate that our technique yields statistically significantly forecast improvements across several sets of products subject to holiday-driven demand surges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NeurIPS Time Series in the Age of Large Models (2024)</p></details> |

This bivariate function of frequency and quantile level provides a richer view of serial dependence than that offered by the ordinary spectrum. We propose a new method for estimating the quantile-crossing spectrum as a bivariate function of frequency and quantile level. The proposed method, called spline autoregression (SAR), jointly fits an AR model to the quantile-crossing series across multiple quantiles; the AR coefficients are represented as spline functions of the quantile level and penalized for their roughness. Numerical experiments show that when the underlying spectrum is smooth in quantile level the proposed method is able to produce more accurate estimates in comparison with the alternative that ignores the smoothness.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing anomaly detection methods directly analyze time series in the time domain and cannot distinguish some relatively hidden anomaly sequences. We attempt to analyze the impact of frequency on time series from a frequency domain perspective, thus proposing a new time series anomaly detection method called F-SE-LSTM. This method utilizes two sliding windows and fast Fourier transform (FFT) to construct a frequency matrix. Simultaneously, Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are employed to extract frequency-related features within and between periods. Through comparative experiments on multiple datasets such as Yahoo Webscope S5 and Numenta Anomaly Benchmark, the results demonstrate that the frequency matrix constructed by F-SE-LSTM exhibits better discriminative ability than ordinary time domain and frequency domain data. Furthermore, F-SE-LSTM outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning anomaly detection methods in terms of anomaly detection capability and execution efficiency.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Bayesian optimization is a common approach to learning these parameters based on closed-loop experiments. However, traditional Bayesian optimization approaches treat the learning problem as a black box, ignoring valuable information and knowledge about the structure of the underlying problem, resulting in slow convergence and high experimental resource use. We propose a time-series-informed optimization framework that incorporates intermediate performance evaluations from early iterations of each experimental episode into the learning procedure. Additionally, probabilistic early stopping criteria are proposed to terminate unpromising experiments, significantly reducing experimental time. Simulation results show that our approach achieves baseline performance with approximately half the resources. Moreover, with the same resource budget, our approach outperforms the baseline in terms of final closed-loop performance, highlighting its efficiency in sequential decision making scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, submitted to L4DC 2025</p></details> |
| **[PITN: Physics-Informed Temporal Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08488v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring blood pressure with non-invasive sensors has gained popularity for providing comfortable user experiences, one of which is a significant function of smart wearables. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at~\url{https://github.com/Zest86/ACL-PITN}.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[FSMLP: Modelling Channel Dependencies With Simplex Theory Based Multi-Layer Perceptions In Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01654v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in various domains, including web data analysis, energy consumption prediction, and weather forecasting. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are lightweight and effective for capturing temporal dependencies, they are prone to overfitting when used to model inter-channel dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the overfitting problem in channel-wise MLPs using Rademacher complexity theory, revealing that extreme values in time series data exacerbate this issue. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel Simplex-MLP layer, where the weights are constrained within a standard simplex. This strategy encourages the model to learn simpler patterns and thereby reducing overfitting to extreme values. Based on the Simplex-MLP layer, we propose a novel \textbf{F}requency \textbf{S}implex \textbf{MLP} (FSMLP) framework for time series forecasting, comprising of two kinds of modules: \textbf{S}implex \textbf{C}hannel-\textbf{W}ise MLP (SCWM) and \textbf{F}requency \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}LP (FTM). The SCWM effectively leverages the Simplex-MLP to capture inter-channel dependencies, while the FTM is a simple yet efficient temporal MLP designed to extract temporal information from the data. Our theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the Rademacher Complexity for Simplex-MLP is lower than that for standard MLPs. Moreover, we validate our proposed method on seven benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and efficiency, while also showcasing superior scalability. Additionally, we demonstrate that Simplex-MLP can improve other methods that use channel-wise MLP to achieve less overfitting and improved performance.

| **[Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15771v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a challenging problem that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added new experiments probing in-context learning and a simple mechanism for zero-shot forecasting</p></details> |
| **[Comparing Clustering Approaches for Smart Meter Time Series: Investigating the Influence of Dataset Properties on Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02026v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of smart meters for monitoring energy consumption has generated vast quantities of high-resolution time series data which remains underutilised. While clustering has emerged as a fundamental tool for mining smart meter time series (SMTS) data, selecting appropriate clustering methods remains challenging despite numerous comparative studies. These studies often rely on problematic methodologies and consider a limited scope of methods, frequently overlooking compelling methods from the broader time series clustering literature. Consequently, they struggle to provide dependable guidance for practitioners designing their own clustering approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative framework for SMTS clustering methods using expert-informed synthetic datasets that emphasise peak consumption behaviours as fundamental cluster concepts. Using a phased methodology, we first evaluated 31 distance measures and 8 representation methods using leave-one-out classification, then examined the better-suited methods in combination with 11 clustering algorithms. We further assessed the robustness of these combinations to systematic changes in key dataset properties that affect clustering performance on real-world datasets, including cluster balance, noise, and the presence of outliers. Our results revealed that methods accommodating local temporal shifts while maintaining amplitude sensitivity, particularly Dynamic Time Warping and $k$-sliding distance, consistently outperformed traditional approaches. Among other key findings, we identified that when combined with hierarchical clustering using Ward's linkage, these methods demonstrated consistent robustness across varying dataset characteristics without careful parameter tuning. These and other findings inform actionable recommendations for practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA "on autoPilot", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end. It stands on two key components: a differentiable augmentation architecture and an unsupervised validation loss to effectively assess the alignment between augmentation type and anomaly type. Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters. In turn, it outperforms established baselines, including SOTA self-supervised models, on diverse TSAD tasks exhibiting different anomaly types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS workshop on Self-Supervised Learning</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel framework, FGATT, that combines the Fuzzy Graph Attention Network (FGAT) with the Transformer encoder to perform robust and accurate data imputation. FGAT leverages fuzzy rough sets and graph attention mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies dynamically, even in scenarios where predefined spatial information is unavailable. The Transformer encoder is employed to model temporal dependencies, utilizing its self-attention mechanism to focus on significant time-series patterns. A self-adaptive graph construction method is introduced to enable dynamic connectivity learning, ensuring the framework's applicability to a wide range of wireless datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with substantial missing data. The proposed model is well-suited for applications in wireless sensor networks and IoT environments, where data integrity is critical.</p></details> |  |

Here we present the principles and show a method to identify hidden shared dynamics from time series by a two-module, feedforward neural network architecture: the Mapper-Coach network. We reconstruct unobserved, continuous latent variable input, the time series generated by a chaotic logistic map, from the observed values of two simultaneously forced chaotic logistic maps. The network has been trained to predict one of the observed time series based on its own past and conditioned on the other observed time series by error-back propagation. It was shown, that after this prediction have been learned successfully, the activity of the bottleneck neuron, connecting the mapper and the coach module, correlated strongly with the latent shared input variable. The method has the potential to reveal hidden components of dynamical systems, where experimental intervention is not possible.</p></details> |  |

Early detection of CRLM is critical for improving survival rates. Radiologists usually rely on a series of multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scans done during follow-up visits to perform early detection of the potential CRLM. These scans form unique five-dimensional data (time, phase, and axial, sagittal, and coronal planes in 3D CT). Most of the existing deep learning models can readily handle four-dimensional data (e.g., time-series 3D CT images) and it is not clear how well they can be extended to handle the additional dimension of phase. In this paper, we build a dataset of time-series CECT scans to aid in the early diagnosis of CRLM, and build upon state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to evaluate how to best predict CRLM. Our experimental results show that a multi-plane architecture based on 3D bi-directional LSTM, which we call MPBD-LSTM, works best, achieving an area under curve (AUC) of 0.79. On the other hand, analysis of the results shows that there is still great room for further improvement.</p></details> |  |

However, the emergence of transformer networks in various vision tasks raises the question of whether they can outperform CNNs in this task as well. This paper presents a revised version of the Transformer-based Swin UNETR model, specifically adapted for crop segmentation of SITS. The proposed model demonstrates significant advancements, achieving a validation accuracy of 96.14% and a test accuracy of 95.26% on the Munich dataset, surpassing the previous best results of 93.55% for validation and 92.94% for the test. Additionally, the model's performance on the Lombardia dataset is comparable to UNet3D and superior to FPN and DeepLabV3. Experiments of this study indicate that the model will likely achieve comparable or superior accuracy to CNNs while requiring significantly less training time. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for crop segmentation in SITS, opening new avenues for remote sensing applications.</p></details> |  |

Building on the strengths of the original N-BEATS architecture, which excels in handling complex time series data without requiring preprocessing or domain-specific knowledge, N-BEATS* introduces two key modifications. (1) A novel loss function -- combining pinball loss based on MAPE with normalized MSE, the new loss function allows for a more balanced approach by capturing both L1 and L2 loss terms. (2) A modified block architecture -- the internal structure of the N-BEATS blocks is adjusted by introducing a destandardization component to harmonize the processing of different time series, leading to more efficient and less complex forecasting tasks. Evaluated on real-world monthly electricity consumption data from 35 European countries, N-BEATS* demonstrates superior performance compared to its predecessor and other established forecasting methods, including statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models. N-BEATS* achieves the lowest MAPE and RMSE, while also exhibiting the lowest dispersion in forecast errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering group dynamics in coordinated time series via hierarchical recurrent switching-state models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14973v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek a computationally efficient model for a collection of time series arising from multiple interacting entities (a.k.a. "agents"). Recent models of spatiotemporal patterns across individuals fail to incorporate explicit system-level collective behavior that can influence the trajectories of individual entities. To address this gap in the literature, we present a new hierarchical switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to simultaneously learn both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that provides top-down influence on latent entity-level chains which in turn govern the emission of each observed time series. Recurrent feedback from the observations to the latent chains at both entity and system levels allows recent situational context to inform how dynamics unfold at all levels in bottom-up fashion. We hypothesize that including both top-down and bottom-up influences on group dynamics will improve interpretability of the learned dynamics and reduce error when forecasting. Our hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical model can be learned via closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that scale linearly in the number of entities. This is asymptotically no more costly than fitting a separate model for each entity. Analysis of both synthetic data and real basketball team movements suggests our lean parametric model can achieve competitive forecasts compared to larger neural network models that require far more computational resources. Further experiments on soldier data as well as a synthetic task with 64 cooperating entities show how our approach can yield interpretable insights about team dynamics over time.</p></details> |  |

Introducing causality into the modelling process offers a promising way to mitigate these challenges by enhancing interpretability and predictive reliability. However, constructing an initial causal graph manually using domain knowledge is a time-consuming, particularly in complex time series with numerous variables. To address this, causal discovery algorithms can provide a preliminary causal structure that domain experts can refine. This study investigates causal feature selection with domain knowledge using a data centre system as an example. We use simulated time-series data to compare different causal feature selection with traditional machine-learning feature selection methods. Our results show that predictions based on causal features are more robust and interpretable compared to those derived from traditional methods. These findings underscore the potential of combining causal discovery algorithms with human expertise to improve machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity and weak convergence are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series, in terms of uniform moment bounds for partial sums and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, $L_p$-Lipschitz regularity. This yields comprehensive general results on the weak convergence of sequential empirical processes, which are applicable to various notions of dependence. Especially, we show that our moment conditions imply the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions (on the degree of dependence and the complexity of the indexing function class) as known for the classical empirical process. This is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing time series. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and suitable pathwise uniform Lipschitz properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Much Can Time-related Features Enhance Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01557v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) have primarily focused on capturing cross-time and cross-variate (channel) dependencies within historical data. However, a critical aspect often overlooked by many existing methods is the explicit incorporation of \textbf{time-related features} (e.g., season, month, day of the week, hour, minute), which are essential components of time series data. The absence of this explicit time-related encoding limits the ability of current models to capture cyclical or seasonal trends and long-term dependencies, especially with limited historical input. To address this gap, we introduce a simple yet highly efficient module designed to encode time-related features, Time Stamp Forecaster (TimeSter), thereby enhancing the backbone's forecasting performance. By integrating TimeSter with a linear backbone, our model, TimeLinear, significantly improves the performance of a single linear projector, reducing MSE by an average of 23\% on benchmark datasets such as Electricity and Traffic. Notably, TimeLinear achieves these gains while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency, delivering results that are on par with or exceed state-of-the-art models, despite using a fraction of the parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Principal Component Analysis for Large-dimensional Matrix Factor Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06423v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix factor models have been growing popular dimension reduction tools for large-dimensional matrix time series. However, the heteroscedasticity of the idiosyncratic components has barely received any attention. Starting from the pseudo likelihood function, this paper introduces a Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) method for matrix factor model which takes the heteroscedasticity into account. Theoretically, we first derive the asymptotic distributions of the GPCA estimators by assuming the separable covariance matrices are known in advance. We then propose adaptive thresholding estimators for the separable covariance matrices and derive their convergence rates, which is of independent interest. We also show that this would not alter the asymptotic distributions of the GPCA estimators under certain regular sparsity conditions in the high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation literature. The GPCA estimators are shown to be more efficient than the state-of-the-art methods under certain heteroscedasticity conditions. Thorough numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing approaches. Analysis of a financial portfolio dataset illustrates the empirical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

While existing 3D editing methods excel at modifying color, texture, and style, they struggle with extensive geometric or appearance changes, thus limiting their applications. We propose Perturb-and-Revise, which makes possible a variety of NeRF editing. First, we perturb the NeRF parameters with random initializations to create a versatile initialization. We automatically determine the perturbation magnitude through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Perturb-and-Revise facilitates flexible, effective, and consistent editing of color, appearance, and geometry in 3D.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opt2Skill: Imitating Dynamically-feasible Whole-Body Trajectories for Versatile Humanoid Loco-Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20514v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are designed to perform diverse loco-manipulation tasks. However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Socially-Informed Reconstruction for Pedestrian Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04673v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenge for autonomous systems, particularly due to the intricate dynamics of social interactions. Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong performances in comparison to state of-the-art methods on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04184v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.</p></details> | 16 |
| **[Towards Fast and Safety-Guaranteed Trajectory Planning and Tracking for Time-Varying Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04129v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When deploying autonomous systems in unknown and changing environments, it is critical that their motion planning and control algorithms are computationally efficient and can be reapplied online in real time, whilst providing theoretical safety guarantees in the presence of disturbances. The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[Abstraction-based Control of Unknown Continuous-Space Models with Just Two Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03892v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) offer an effective scheme for approximating the complex continuous-space systems with simpler models in the discrete-space domain. A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal relation between the original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a discrete controller designed for the symbolic model can be effectively implemented as a hybrid controller (using an interface map) for the original system. This task becomes even more challenging when the exact mathematical model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To address this, the existing literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven methods, which require collecting a large amount of data from the original system. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state trajectories collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a hybrid controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the concept of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness between the state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven symbolic model. By satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data, which intuitively ensures that the unknown system is persistently excited, we directly design an ASF and its corresponding hybrid controller using finite-length data without explicitly identifying the unknown system, while providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach through a case study.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while significantly narrowing down the performance gap with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kmcode1.github.io/Projects/SG-I2V/</p></details> |

Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03195v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference Research (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Trajectory Classification and Landmark Inference on Simplicial Complexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03145v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of classifying trajectories on a discrete or discretised 2-dimensional manifold modelled by a simplicial complex. Previous works have proposed to project the trajectories into the harmonic eigenspace of the Hodge Laplacian, and then cluster the resulting embeddings. However, if the considered space has vanishing homology (i.e., no "holes"), then the harmonic space of the 1-Hodge Laplacian is trivial and thus the approach fails. Here we propose to view this issue akin to a sensor placement problem and present an algorithm that aims to learn "optimal holes" to distinguish a set of given trajectory classes. Specifically, given a set of labelled trajectories, which we interpret as edge-flows on the underlying simplicial complex, we search for 2-simplices whose deletion results in an optimal separation of the trajectory labels according to the corresponding spectral embedding of the trajectories into the harmonic space. Finally, we generalise this approach to the unsupervised setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at the 58th Annual Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2024</p></details> |

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

Traditionally, this task relies on sequence modeling and behavior analysis techniques applied to tabular or video-based data, but these methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture partial matching. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pairwise spatiotemporal partial trajectory matching that transforms tabular spatiotemporal data into interpretable trajectory images based on specified time windows, allowing for partial trajectory analysis. This approach includes localization of trajectories, checking for spatial overlap, and pairwise matching using a Siamese Neural Network. We evaluate our method on a co-walking classification task, demonstrating its effectiveness in a novel co-behavior identification application. Our model surpasses established methods, achieving an F1-score up to 0.73. Additionally, we explore the method's utility for pair routine pattern analysis in real-world scenarios, providing insights into the frequency, timing, and duration of shared behaviors. This approach offers a powerful, interpretable framework for spatiotemporal behavior analysis, with potential applications in social behavior research, urban planning, and healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission. 17 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

Despite researchers' efforts, it remains a challenge to accurately account for social interactions among agents when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate such social modifications to future trajectories in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by the resonance phenomenon of vibration systems, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to forecast pedestrian trajectories as co-vibrations, and regard that social interactions are associated with spectral properties of agents' trajectories. It forecasts future trajectories as three distinct vibration terms to represent agents' future plans from different perspectives in a decoupled way. Also, agents' social interactions and how they modify scheduled trajectories will be considered in a resonance-like manner by learning the similarities of their trajectory spectrums. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrian or vehicle, have verified the usefulness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

The complex interactions brought by different relations between agents are a crucial reason that poses challenges to this task. Researchers have put much effort into designing a system using rule-based or data-based models to extract and validate the patterns between pedestrian trajectories and these interactions, which has not been adequately addressed yet. Inspired by how humans perceive social interactions with different level of relations to themself, this work proposes the GrouP ConCeption (short for GPCC) model composed of the Group method, which categorizes nearby agents into either group members or non-group members based on a long-term distance kernel function, and the Conception module, which perceives both visual and acoustic information surrounding the target agent. Evaluated across multiple datasets, the GPCC model demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory prediction accuracy, validating its effectiveness in modeling both social and individual dynamics.

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v3)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Latent Goal by Learning from Trajectory Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02125v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A glowing body of work has emerged focusing on instruction-following policies for open-world agents, aiming to better align the agent's behavior with human intentions. However, the performance of these policies is highly susceptible to the initial prompt, which leads to extra efforts in selecting the best instructions. We propose a framework named Preference Goal Tuning (PGT). PGT allows an instruction following policy to interact with the environment to collect several trajectories, which will be categorized into positive and negative samples based on preference. Then we use preference learning to fine-tune the initial goal latent representation with the categorized trajectories while keeping the policy backbone frozen. The experiment result shows that with minimal data and training, PGT achieves an average relative improvement of 72.0% and 81.6% over 17 tasks in 2 different foundation policies respectively, and outperforms the best human-selected instructions. Moreover, PGT surpasses full fine-tuning in the out-of-distribution (OOD) task-execution environments by 13.4%, indicating that our approach retains strong generalization capabilities. Since our approach stores a single latent representation for each task independently, it can be viewed as an efficient method for continual learning, without the risk of catastrophic forgetting or task interference. In short, PGT enhances the performance of agents across nearly all tasks in the Minecraft Skillforge benchmark and demonstrates robustness to the execution environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Another Vertical View: A Hierarchical Network for Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction via Spectrums](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05106v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the fast development of AI-related techniques, the applications of trajectory prediction are no longer limited to easier scenes and trajectories. More and more trajectories with different forms, such as coordinates, bounding boxes, and even high-dimensional human skeletons, need to be analyzed and forecasted. Among these heterogeneous trajectories, interactions between different elements within a frame of trajectory, which we call ``Dimension-wise Interactions'', would be more complex and challenging. However, most previous approaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, and potential dimension-wise interactions are less concerned. In this work, we expand the trajectory prediction task by introducing the trajectory dimensionality $M$, thus extending its application scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories. We first introduce the Haar transform as an alternative to Fourier transform to better capture the time-frequency properties of each trajectory-dimension. Then, we adopt the bilinear structure to model and fuse two factors simultaneously, including the time-frequency response and the dimension-wise interaction, to forecast heterogeneous trajectories via trajectory spectrums hierarchically in a generic way. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on ETH-UCY, SDD, nuScenes, and Human3.6M with heterogeneous trajectories, including 2D coordinates, 2D/3D bounding boxes, and 3D human skeletons.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods excel at novel view synthesis on recorded trajectories, they face challenges with novel trajectories due to limited views of driving videos and the vastness of driving environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel free-form driving view synthesis approach, dubbed DriveX, by leveraging video generative prior to optimize a 3D model across a variety of trajectories. Concretely, we crafted an inverse problem that enables a video diffusion model to be utilized as a prior for many-trajectory optimization of a parametric 3D model (e.g., Gaussian splatting). To seamlessly use the generative prior, we iteratively conduct this process during optimization. Our resulting model can produce high-fidelity virtual driving environments outside the recorded trajectory, enabling free-form trajectory driving simulation. Beyond real driving scenes, DriveX can also be utilized to simulate virtual driving worlds from AI-generated videos.</p></details> |  |

When the researchers use NS-2 to simulate a single anchor-assisted localization model, they face the problem of creating the movement file of the movable anchor. The proposed framework solved this problem by allowing them to create the movement scenario regarding different trajectories. The proposed framework lets the researcher set the needed parameters for simulating various static path models, which can be displayed through the graphical user interface. The researcher can also view the mobility of the movable anchor with control of its speed and communication range. The proposed framework has been validated by comparing its results to NS-2 outputs plus comparing it against existing tools. Finally, this framework has been published on the Code Project website and downloaded by many users.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW), which transcribes the trajectory optimization into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity in each itera-tion to achieve fast trajectory generation. Through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, the customized trajectory representation is presented, which implies the equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and deduction of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into an uncon-strained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time com-plexity to further improve efficiency. The simulation experi-ments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in ran-domly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems; Recived Reject with major revision and encouragement to resubmit (31-Oct-2024)</p></details> |

GPS trajectory data offers valuable information for ETA, but challenges arise due to temporal sparsity, variable sequence lengths, and the interdependencies among multiple trucks. To address these issues, we propose the Temporal-Attribute-Spatial Tri-space Coordination (TAS-TsC) framework, which leverages three feature spaces-temporal, attribute, and spatial-to enhance ETA. Our framework consists of a Temporal Learning Module (TLM) using state space models to capture temporal dependencies, an Attribute Extraction Module (AEM) that transforms sequential features into structured attribute embeddings, and a Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) that models the interactions among multiple trajectories using graph representation learning.These modules collaboratively learn trajectory embeddings, which are then used by a Downstream Prediction Module (DPM) to estimate arrival times. We validate TAS-TsC on real truck trajectory datasets collected from Shenzhen, China, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BIGCity: A Universal Spatiotemporal Model for Unified Trajectory and Traffic State Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00953v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical dynamic ST data includes trajectory data (representing individual-level mobility) and traffic state data (representing population-level mobility). Traditional studies often treat trajectory and traffic state data as distinct, independent modalities, each tailored to specific tasks within a single modality. However, real-world applications, such as navigation apps, require joint analysis of trajectory and traffic state data. Treating these data types as two separate domains can lead to suboptimal model performance. Although recent advances in ST data pre-training and ST foundation models aim to develop universal models for ST data analysis, most existing models are "multi-task, solo-data modality" (MTSM), meaning they can handle multiple tasks within either trajectory data or traffic state data, but not both simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper introduces BIGCity, the first multi-task, multi-data modality (MTMD) model for ST data analysis. The model targets two key challenges in designing an MTMD ST model: (1) unifying the representations of different ST data modalities, and (2) unifying heterogeneous ST analysis tasks. To overcome the first challenge, BIGCity introduces a novel ST-unit that represents both trajectories and traffic states in a unified format. Additionally, for the second challenge, BIGCity adopts a tunable large model with ST task-oriented prompt, enabling it to perform a range of heterogeneous tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BIGCity achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 tasks, outperforming 18 baselines. To the best of our knowledge, BIGCity is the first model capable of handling both trajectories and traffic states for diverse heterogeneous tasks.

Local differential privacy (LDP) provides provable privacy guarantees for users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory collection methods ensure LDP only for discrete location spaces, where the number of locations affects their privacy guarantees and trajectory utility. Moreover, the location space is often naturally continuous, such as in flying and sailing trajectories, making these methods unsuitable. This paper proposes two trajectory collection methods that ensure LDP for continuous spaces: TraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C, which perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are theoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility. TraCS can also be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the nearest discrete points. It is independent of the number of locations and has only $\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation results on discrete location spaces validate this advantage and show that TraCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility, especially for large privacy parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VLDB 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a dynamic weight adjustment scheme using a neural network to predict the optimal weights of objectives in an optimization-based motion planner. We adopt a spatial-temporal trajectory planner and incorporate diverse objectives to achieve a balance among safety, efficiency, and goal achievement in complex and dynamic environments. We design the network structure, observation encoding, and reward function to effectively train the policy network using reinforcement learning, allowing the robot to adapt its behavior in real time based on environmental and pedestrian information. Simulation results show improved safety compared to the fixed-weight planner and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods, and verify the ability of the learned policy to adaptively adjust the weights based on the observed situations. The approach's feasibility is demonstrated in a navigation task using an autonomous delivery robot across a crowded corridor over a 300 m distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

To address this issue, this paper leverages Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) for the efficient construction of Channel Knowledge Maps (CKM) and UAV trajectory design. Given the time-consuming nature of channel data collection, AI techniques are employed in a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to extract environmental features and augment the data. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving CKM construction accuracy. Moreover, integrating CKM into UAV trajectory planning reduces channel gain uncertainty, demonstrating its potential to enhance wireless communication efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we introduce a user-friendly toolkit enabling the expansion of InterHub with both public and private data. By unifying, categorizing, and analyzing diverse interaction events, InterHub facilitates cross-comparative studies and large-scale research, thereby advancing the evaluation and development of autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Loss Strategy for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction: Combining Off-Road, Diversity, and Directional Consistency Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19747v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning in autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments.

| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |

This study aims to address these challenges by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 fig...</summary><p>7 figures, 3 tables, 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

This paper introduces trajectory attention, a novel approach that performs attention along available pixel trajectories for fine-grained camera motion control. Unlike existing methods that often yield imprecise outputs or neglect temporal correlations, our approach possesses a stronger inductive bias that seamlessly injects trajectory information into the video generation process. Importantly, our approach models trajectory attention as an auxiliary branch alongside traditional temporal attention. This design enables the original temporal attention and the trajectory attention to work in synergy, ensuring both precise motion control and new content generation capability, which is critical when the trajectory is only partially available. Experiments on camera motion control for images and videos demonstrate significant improvements in precision and long-range consistency while maintaining high-quality generation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be extended to other video motion control tasks, such as first-frame-guided video editing, where it excels in maintaining content consistency over large spatial and temporal ranges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: xizaoqu.github.io/trajattn/</p></details> |

Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states. These results indicate that TEA captures critical, environment-specific characteristics, enabling RL agents to generalize effectively across dynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RED: Effective Trajectory Representation Learning with Comprehensive Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15096v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can then be used for various downstream tasks, including trajectory similarity computation, trajectory classification, and travel-time estimation. However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by VLDB2025</p></details> |

The decision making and trajectory planning tasks are jointly formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with an integrated objective function. However, integrating the discrete decision variables into the continuous trajectory optimization leads to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with inherent nonlinearity and nonconvexity. To address the challenge in solving the problem, the original problem is decomposed into two sub-stages, and a two-stage optimization (TSO) based approach is presented to ensure the coherence in outcomes for the two stages. The optimization problem in the first stage determines the optimal decision sequence that acts as an informed initialization. With the outputs from the first stage, the second stage necessitates the use of a high-fidelity vehicle model and strict enforcement of the collision avoidance constraints as part of the trajectory planning problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed planner across diverse multi-lane scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner simultaneously generates a sequence of optimal decisions and the corresponding trajectory that significantly improves driving performance in terms of driving safety and traveling efficiency as compared to alternative methods. Additionally, we implement the closed-loop simulation in CARLA, and the results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed planner to adapt to changing driving situations with high computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory-planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Accurate prediction of dissection trajectories is crucial for better decision-making, reducing intraoperative errors, and improving surgical training. Nevertheless, predicting these trajectories is challenging due to variable tumor margins and dynamic visual conditions. To address this issue, we create the ESD Trajectory and Confidence Map-based Safety Margin (ETSM) dataset with $1849$ short clips, focusing on submucosal dissection with a dual-arm robotic system. We also introduce a framework that combines optimal dissection trajectory prediction with a confidence map-based safety margin, providing a more secure and intelligent decision-making tool to minimize surgical risks for ESD procedures. Additionally, we propose the Regression-based Confidence Map Prediction Network (RCMNet), which utilizes a regression approach to predict confidence maps for dissection areas, thereby delineating various levels of safety margins. We evaluate our RCMNet using three distinct experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, robustness assessment, and out-of-domain evaluation. Experimental results show that our approach excels in the confidence map-based safety margin prediction task, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of only $3.18$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a regression approach for visual guidance concerning delineating varying safety levels of dissection areas. Our approach bridges gaps in current research by improving prediction accuracy and enhancing the safety of the dissection process, showing great clinical significance in practice.</p></details> |  |

The trade-off is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial obstacles for small-scale aggregation. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We then deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases--self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data--to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant in tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, significantly reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</p></details> |  |
| **[QP Chaser: Polynomial Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14273v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining the visibility of the target is one of the major objectives of aerial tracking missions. This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming (QP). Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including 1) single- and dual-target following and 2) both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the target's center, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable sets of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path topology, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable set among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This has fueled interest in developing intuitive tools that let users leverage video generation as world simulators. Text-to-video (T2V) generation is one such approach, enabling video creation from text descriptions only. Yet, due to the inherent ambiguity in texts and the limited temporal information offered by text prompts, researchers have explored additional control signals like trajectory-guided systems, for more accurate T2V generation. Nonetheless, methods to evaluate whether T2V models can generate realistic interactions between multiple objects are lacking. We introduce InTraGen, a pipeline for improved trajectory-based generation of object interaction scenarios. We propose 4 new datasets and a novel trajectory quality metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed InTraGen. To achieve object interaction, we introduce a multi-modal interaction encoding pipeline with an object ID injection mechanism that enriches object-environment interactions. Our results demonstrate improvements in both visual fidelity and quantitative performance. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/insait-institute/InTraGen</p></details> |  |
| **[A Parameter Adaptive Trajectory Tracking and Motion Control Framework for Autonomous Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17745v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the trajectory tracking and motion control problems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). A parameter adaptive control framework for AVs is proposed to enhance tracking accuracy and yaw stability. While establishing linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and three robust controllers, the control framework addresses trajectory tracking and motion control in a modular fashion, without introducing complexity into each controller. The robust performance has been guaranteed in three robust controllers by considering the parameter uncertainties, mismatch of unmodeled subsystem as well as external disturbance, comprehensively. Also, the dynamic characteristics of uncertain parameters are identified by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, while the boundaries of three robust factors are determined through combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian optimization machine learning methods, reducing the conservatism of the controller. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse robust factors are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically. The simulation results on MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim joint platform demonstrate that the proposed methodology considerably improves tracking accuracy, driving stability, and robust performance, guaranteeing the feasibility and capability of driving in extreme scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring the Heat: Rapid Trajectory Optimization with Pseudospectral Techniques and the Affine Geometric Heat Flow Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12962v2)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems in a time-efficient manner while adhering to constraints is a challenging task. This paper introduces PHLAME, which applies pseudospectral collocation and spatial vector algebra to efficiently solve the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for trajectory optimization. Unlike traditional PDE approaches like the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE, which solve for a function over the entire state space, computing a solution to the AGHF PDE scales more efficiently because its solution is defined over a two-dimensional domain, thereby avoiding the intractability of state-space scaling. To solve the AGHF one usually applies the Method of Lines (MOL), which discretizes one variable of the AGHF PDE, and converts the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are solved using standard time-integration methods. Though powerful, this method requires a fine discretization to generate accurate solutions and requires evaluating the AGHF PDE which is computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems. PHLAME overcomes this deficiency by using a pseudospectral method, which reduces the number of function evaluations required to yield a high accuracy solution thereby allowing it to scale efficiently to high-dimensional robotic systems. To further increase computational speed, this paper presents analytical expressions for the AGHF and its Jacobian, both of which can be computed efficiently using rigid body dynamics algorithms. PHLAME is tested across various dynamical systems, with and without obstacles and compared to a number of state-of-the-art techniques. PHLAME generates trajectories for a 44-dimensional state-space system in $\sim5$ seconds, much faster than current state-of-the-art techniques.

Although deep learning-based approaches - especially those utilizing transformer-based and generative models - have markedly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions, they frequently overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions critical for real-world driving applications, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. To address the issue, this study introduces a scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction, which integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a generative framework, improving both the accuracy and plausibility of predicted trajectories. The model utilizes a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle dynamics by scaling noise with encoded historical features within the diffusion process. Particularly, it employs a cross-attention-based transformer architecture to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.11941</p></details> |

In this work, a learning-based control approach is introduced to unlock the versatility and adaptiveness of flapping-wing flight. We propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for a high degree-of-freedom (DoF) bird-inspired flapping-wing robot that allows for multimodal flight and agile trajectory tracking. Stability analysis was performed on the closed-loop system comprising of the flapping-wing system and the RL policy. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate that the RL-based controller can successfully learn complex wing trajectory patterns, achieve stable flight, switch between flight modes spontaneously, and track different trajectories under various aerodynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning and Control for Robotic Magnetic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14950v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic magnetic manipulation offers a minimally invasive approach to gastrointestinal examinations through capsule endoscopy. However, controlling such systems using external permanent magnets (EPM) is challenging due to nonlinear magnetic interactions, especially when there are complex navigation requirements such as avoidance of sensitive tissues. In this work, we present a novel trajectory planning and control method incorporating dynamics and navigation requirements, using a single EPM fixed to a robotic arm to manipulate an internal permanent magnet (IPM). Our approach employs a constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator that considers the dynamics of the IPM to generate optimal trajectories for both the EPM and IPM. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments, motivated by capsule endoscopy operations, demonstrate the robustness of the method, showcasing resilience to external disturbances and precise control under varying conditions. The experimental results show that the IPM reaches the goal position with a maximum mean error of 0.18 cm and a standard deviation of 0.21 cm. This work introduces a unified framework for constrained trajectory optimization in magnetic manipulation, directly incorporating both the IPM's dynamics and the EPM's manipulability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

Existing TRL methods use either grid trajectories, capturing movement in free space, or road trajectories, capturing movement in a road network, as input. We observe that the two types of trajectories are complementary, providing either region and location information or providing road structure and movement regularity. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal TRL method, dubbed GREEN, to jointly utilize Grid and Road trajectory Expressions for Effective representatioN learning. In particular, we transform raw GPS trajectories into both grid and road trajectories and tailor two encoders to capture their respective information. To align the two encoders such that they complement each other, we adopt a contrastive loss to encourage them to produce similar embeddings for the same raw trajectory and design a mask language model (MLM) loss to use grid trajectories to help reconstruct masked road trajectories. To learn the final trajectory representation, a dual-modal interactor is used to fuse the outputs of the two encoders via cross-attention. We compare GREEN with 7 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, finding that GREEN consistently outperforms all baselines and improves the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by an average of 15.99\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by KDD2025(August Cycle)</p></details> |

These models help aircraft detect conflict and plan avoidance maneuvers, which is especially important in Unmanned Aircraft systems (UAS) landing management due to the congested airspace near vertiports. In this paper, we propose a landing trajectory prediction model for UAS based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is a prestigious neural network that has been developed for many years. In previous research, GAN has achieved many state-of-the-art results in many generation tasks. The GAN consists of one neural network generator and a neural network discriminator. Because of the learning capacity of the neural networks, the generator is capable to understand the features of the sample trajectory. The generator takes the previous trajectory as input and outputs some random status of a flight. According to the results of the experiences, the proposed model can output more accurate predictions than the baseline method(GMR) in various datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, we also create a real UAV landing dataset that includes more than 2600 trajectories of drone control manually by real pilots.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, AIAA SCITECH 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a learning-based resource allocation scheme in an ultra-dense UAV communication network, where the GUs' service demands are time-varying with unknown distributions. We formulate the non-cooperative game among multiple co-channel UAVs as a stochastic game, where each UAV jointly optimizes its trajectory, user association, and downlink power control to maximize the expectation of its locally cumulative energy efficiency under the interference and energy constraints. To cope with the scalability issue in a large-scale network, we further formulate the problem as a mean-field game (MFG), which simplifies the interactions among the UAVs into a two-player game between a representative UAV and a mean-field. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the MFG, and propose a model-free mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm named maximum entropy mean-field deep Q network (ME-MFDQN) to solve the mean-field equilibrium in both fully and partially observable scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the performance can be further enhanced if the GUs' service demands exhibit higher temporal correlation or if the UAVs have wider observation capabilities over their nearby GUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

By converting the vehicle's position and velocity information from the Cartesian coordinate system to Frenet coordinate system, this method can more accurately describe the vehicle's deviation and travel distance relative to the center line of the road. The DDPG algorithm adopts the Actor-Critic framework, uses deep neural networks for strategy and value evaluation, and combines the experience replay mechanism and target network to improve the algorithm's stability and data utilization efficiency. Experimental results show that the DDPG algorithm based on Frenet coordinate system performs well in trajectory-tracking tasks in complex environments, achieves high-precision and stable path tracking, and demonstrates its application potential in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Diffusion Policy: manipulation trajectory generation via contact guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12982v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making in robotics using denoising diffusion processes has increasingly become a hot research topic, but end-to-end policies perform poorly in tasks with rich contact and have limited controllability. This paper proposes Hierarchical Diffusion Policy (HDP), a new imitation learning method of using objective contacts to guide the generation of robot trajectories. The policy is divided into two layers: the high-level policy predicts the contact for the robot's next object manipulation based on 3D information, while the low-level policy predicts the action sequence toward the high-level contact based on the latent variables of observation and contact. We represent both level policies as conditional denoising diffusion processes, and combine behavioral cloning and Q-learning to optimize the low level policy for accurately guiding actions towards contact. We benchmark Hierarchical Diffusion Policy across 6 different tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the existing state of-the-art imitation learning method Diffusion Policy with an average improvement of 20.8%. We find that contact guidance yields significant improvements, including superior performance, greater interpretability, and stronger controllability, especially on contact-rich tasks. To further unlock the potential of HDP, this paper proposes a set of key technical contributions including snapshot gradient optimization, 3D conditioning, and prompt guidance, which improve the policy's optimization efficiency, spatial awareness, and controllability respectively. Finally, real world experiments verify that HDP can handle both rigid and deformable objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.04137 by other authors</p></details> |

Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Information Minimization in UAV-Assisted Covert Communication: Trajectory and Beamforming Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12312v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential for time-sensitive applications. Due to wireless channel variation, received data may have an expiration time, particularly in critical situations such as rescue operations, natural disasters, or the military. Age of Information (AoI) is a metric that measures the freshness of received packets to specify the validity period of information. In addition, it is necessary to guarantee the privacy of confidential information transmission through air-to-ground links against eavesdroppers. This paper investigates UAV-assisted covert communication to minimize AoI in the presence of an aerial eavesdropper for the first time. However, to ensure the eavesdropper's error detection rate, UAV-enabled beamforming employs the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique to cover the covert user by a public user. PD-NOMA technique significantly improves the user's AoI, too. The joint optimization problem contains non-convex constraints and coupled optimization variables, including UAV trajectory, beamforming design, and the user's AoI which is challenging to derive a direct solution. We have developed an efficient alternating optimization technique to address the formulated optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of the main parameters on the performance of the proposed communication system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11587v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we study contraction of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and contraction rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Decision Transformer with Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11327v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) can learn effective policy from offline datasets by converting the offline reinforcement learning (RL) into a supervised sequence modeling task, where the trajectory elements are generated auto-regressively conditioned on the return-to-go (RTG).However, the sequence modeling learning approach tends to learn policies that converge on the sub-optimal trajectories within the dataset, for lack of bridging data to move to better trajectories, even if the condition is set to the highest RTG.To address this issue, we introduce Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation (BG), which expands the trajectories of the dataset with branches generated by a diffusion model.The trajectory branch is generated based on the segment of the trajectory within the dataset, and leads to trajectories with higher returns.We concatenate the generated branch with the trajectory segment as an expansion of the trajectory.After expanding, DT has more opportunities to learn policies to move to better trajectories, preventing it from converging to the sub-optimal trajectories.Empirically, after processing with BG, DT outperforms state-of-the-art sequence modeling methods on D4RL benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of adding branches to the dataset without further modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Map-Free Trajectory Prediction with Map Distillation and Hierarchical Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10961v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable motion forecasting of surrounding agents is essential for ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. Many existing trajectory prediction methods rely heavily on high-definition (HD) maps as strong driving priors. However, the availability and accuracy of these priors are not guaranteed due to substantial costs to build, localization errors of vehicles, or ongoing road constructions. In this paper, we introduce MFTP, a Map-Free Trajectory Prediction method that offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for HD maps during inference while still benefiting from map priors during training via knowledge distillation. Second, we present a novel hierarchical encoder that effectively extracts spatial-temporal agent features and aggregates them into multiple trajectory queries. Additionally, we introduce an iterative decoder that sequentially decodes trajectory queries to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse dataset under the map-free setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stable Continual Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10809v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the inherent non-stationarity prevalent in real-world applications, continual Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to equip the agent with the capability to address a series of sequentially presented decision-making tasks. Within this problem setting, a pivotal challenge revolves around \textit{catastrophic forgetting} issue, wherein the agent is prone to effortlessly erode the decisional knowledge associated with past encountered tasks when learning the new one. In recent progresses, the \textit{generative replay} methods have showcased substantial potential by employing generative models to replay data distribution of past tasks. Compared to storing the data from past tasks directly, this category of methods circumvents the growing storage overhead and possible data privacy concerns. However, constrained by the expressive capacity of generative models, existing \textit{generative replay} methods face challenges in faithfully reconstructing the data distribution of past tasks, particularly in scenarios with a myriad of tasks or high-dimensional data. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in various generative tasks, this paper introduces a novel continual RL algorithm DISTR (Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay) that employs a diffusion model to memorize the high-return trajectory distribution of each encountered task and wakeups these distributions during the policy learning on new tasks. Besides, considering the impracticality of replaying all past data each time, a prioritization mechanism is proposed to prioritize the trajectory replay of pivotal tasks in our method. Empirical experiments on the popular continual RL benchmark \texttt{Continual World} demonstrate that our proposed method obtains a favorable balance between \textit{stability} and \textit{plasticity}, surpassing various existing continual RL baselines in average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, inclusion at ICLR 2024 Workshop on Generative Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</p></details> |  |

Within this subgroup-oriented framework, we address the challenge of systematic missing data, a scenario in which some feature values are missing for all tuples of a subgroup, due to flawed data integration, regulatory constraints, or privacy concerns. Feature selection is governed by finding mutual Information, a popular quantification of correlation, between features and a target variable. Our goal is to identify top-K feature subsets of some fixed size with the highest joint mutual information with a target variable. In the presence of systematic missing data, the closed form of mutual information could not simply be applied. We argue that in such a setting, leveraging relationships between available feature mutual information within a subgroup or across subgroups can assist inferring missing mutual information values. We propose a generalizable model based on heterogeneous graph neural network to identify interdependencies between feature-subgroup-target variable connections by modeling it as a multiplex graph, and employing information propagation between its nodes. We address two distinct scalability challenges related to training and propose principled solutions to tackle them. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions both qualitatively and running time wise.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cognac shot to forget bad memories: Corrective Unlearning in GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00789v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly being used for a variety of ML applications on graph data. Because graph data does not follow the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, adversarial manipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through message passing, which deteriorates the model's performance. To allow model developers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained GNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find that current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of manipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new graph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the manipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the performance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating retraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient. We hope our work assists GNN developers in mitigating harmful effects caused by issues in real-world data post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/varshitakolipaka/corrective-unlearning-for-gnns</p></details> |  |

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 22 figures.

| **[Automated Label Unification for Multi-Dataset Semantic Segmentation with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10534v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep supervised models possess significant capability to assimilate extensive training data, thereby presenting an opportunity to enhance model performance through training on multiple datasets. However, conflicts arising from different label spaces among datasets may adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically construct a unified label space across multiple datasets using graph neural networks. This enables semantic segmentation models to be trained simultaneously on multiple datasets, resulting in performance improvements. Unlike existing methods, our approach facilitates seamless training without the need for additional manual reannotation or taxonomy reconciliation. This significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-dataset segmentation model training. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other multi-dataset training methods when trained on seven datasets simultaneously, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildDash 2 benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We first propose a second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional ET. Utilizing this model, we derive novel closed-form Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the ET kinematic parameter estimation, such as the center range, azimuth angle, elevation angle, and orientation. Further, we formulate and solve two transmit beamforming design problems with optimization algorithms. The first one, named the CRB minimization problem, minimizes the CRB under constraints of communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, transmit power, and ET-specific beam coverage requirement, which is solved using the semidefinite relaxation technique. The second one, named the weighted-ISAC-metric problem, targets an weighted objective function combining the communication sum rate and sensing CRB, and is solved using the successive convex approximation technique. Additionally, by exploiting the penalty method, we introduce an unsupervised learning-based approach and propose a unique ISAC graph neural network (ISACGNN), composed of separate communication, sensing, and integration modules, to address both problems. Numerical results reveal the diverse CRB characteristics for different radar targets. The proposed beamforming designs are superior to existing baselines with better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and a more appropriate beampattern for sensing the 3D ET. Besides, our proposed ISACGNN can effectively mimic the dynamic structures of the SINR, sum rate, and CRB, demonstrating remarkable scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, partially published in IEEE Global Communications Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network(GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering(CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning(CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[A Self-guided Multimodal Approach to Enhancing Graph Representation Learning for Alzheimer's Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06212v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models designed to handle irregularly structured data. However, their generic design often proves inadequate for analyzing brain connectomes in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), highlighting the need to incorporate domain knowledge for optimal performance. Infusing AD-related knowledge into GNNs is a complicated task. Existing methods typically rely on collaboration between computer scientists and domain experts, which can be both time-intensive and resource-demanding. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel self-guided, knowledge-infused multimodal GNN that autonomously incorporates domain knowledge into the model development process. Our approach conceptualizes domain knowledge as natural language and introduces a specialized multimodal GNN capable of leveraging this uncurated knowledge to guide the learning process of the GNN, such that it can improve the model performance and strengthen the interpretability of the predictions. To evaluate our framework, we curated a comprehensive dataset of recent peer-reviewed papers on AD and integrated it with multiple real-world AD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to extract relevant domain knowledge, provide graph-based explanations for AD diagnosis, and improve the overall performance of the GNN. This approach provides a more scalable and efficient alternative to inject domain knowledge for AD compared with the manual design from the domain expert, advancing both prediction accuracy and interpretability in AD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

As a result, it becomes necessary to develop joint models that encompass both antennas and wireless propagation channels. To achieve this, we utilize the multi-port communication theory, which considers impedance matching among the source, transmission medium, and load to facilitate efficient power transfer. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of insertion loss, mutual coupling, and other factors on the performance of multi-port matching networks. Next, to further improve system performance, we explore two important deep unfolding designs for the multi-port matching networks: beamforming and power control, respectively. For the hybrid beamforming, we develop a deep unfolding framework, i.e., projected gradient descent (PGD)-Net based on unfolding projected gradient descent. For the power control, we design a deep unfolding network, graph neural network (GNN) aided alternating optimization (AO)Net, which considers the interaction between different ports in optimizing power allocation. Numerical results verify the necessity of considering insertion loss in the dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) performance analysis. Besides, the proposed PGD-Net based hybrid beamforming approaches approximate the conventional model-based algorithm with very low complexity. Moreover, our proposed power control scheme has a fast run time compared to the traditional weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Necessity of Graph Learning and Common Graph Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06173v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning has enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity since the introduction of deep learning in graph contexts. This is no surprise due to the ubiquity of graph data in large scale industrial settings. Tacitly assumed in all graph learning tasks is the separation of the graph structure and node features: node features strictly encode individual data while the graph structure consists only of pairwise interactions. The driving belief is that node features are (by themselves) insufficient for these tasks, so benchmark performance accurately reflects improvements in graph learning. In our paper, we challenge this orthodoxy by showing that, surprisingly, node features are oftentimes more-than-sufficient for many common graph benchmarks, breaking this critical assumption. When comparing against a well-tuned feature-only MLP baseline on seven of the most commonly used graph learning datasets, one gains little benefit from using graph structure on five datasets. We posit that these datasets do not benefit considerably from graph learning because the features themselves already contain enough graph information to obviate or substantially reduce the need for the graph. To illustrate this point, we perform a feature study on these datasets and show how the features are responsible for closing the gap between MLP and graph-method performance. Further, in service of introducing better empirical measures of progress for graph neural networks, we present a challenging parametric family of principled synthetic datasets that necessitate graph information for nontrivial performance. Lastly, we section out a subset of real-world datasets that are not trivially solved by an MLP and hence serve as reasonable benchmarks for graph neural networks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations.

Currently, GNNs in networked systems mostly follow a paradigm of `centralized training, distributed execution', which limits their adaptability and slows down their development cycles. In this work, we fill this gap for the first time by developing a communication-efficient, fully distributed online training approach for GNNs applied to large networked systems. For a mini-batch with $B$ samples, our approach of training an $L$-layer GNN only adds $L$ rounds of message passing to the $LB$ rounds required by GNN inference, with doubled message sizes. Through numerical experiments in graph-based node regression, power allocation, and link scheduling in wireless networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in training GNNs under supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Machine Learning (ML) has recently played a key role in advancing HT research. Various novel techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown HT insertion and detection capabilities. HT insertion with ML techniques, specifically, has seen a spike in research activity due to the shortcomings of conventional HT benchmarks and the inherent human design bias that occurs when we create them. This work continues this innovation by presenting a tool called TrojanForge, capable of generating HT adversarial examples that defeat HT detectors; demonstrating the capabilities of GAN-like adversarial tools for automatic HT insertion. We introduce an RL environment where the RL insertion agent interacts with HT detectors in an insertion-detection loop where the agent collects rewards based on its success in bypassing HT detectors. Our results show that this process helps inserted HTs evade various HT detectors, achieving high attack success percentages. This tool provides insight into why HT insertion fails in some instances and how we can leverage this knowledge in defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Machine Learning on Graphs with Nonlinear Spectral Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01249v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space. We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional MLP learning relies almost exclusively on graph nodes and fails to effectively capture the graph structural information. Previous methods address this issue by processing graph edges into extra inputs for MLPs, but such graph structures may be unavailable for various scenarios. To this end, we propose Prototype-Guided Knowledge Distillation (PGKD), which does not require graph edges (edge-free setting) yet learns structure-aware MLPs. Our insight is to distill graph structural information from GNNs. Specifically, we first employ the class prototypes to analyze the impact of graph structures on GNN teachers, and then design two losses to distill such information from GNNs to MLPs. Experimental results on popular graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGKD.</p></details> | COLING 2025 |

In this paper, we present an extensive empirical study to investigate the impact of graph reduction techniques, specifically graph coarsening and sparsification, on the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments involving multiple datasets and GNN architectures, we examine the effects of four sparsification and six coarsening methods on the poisoning attacks. Our results indicate that, while graph sparsification can mitigate the effectiveness of certain poisoning attacks, such as Mettack, it has limited impact on others, like PGD. Conversely, graph coarsening tends to amplify the adversarial impact, significantly reducing classification accuracy as the reduction ratio decreases. Additionally, we provide a novel analysis of the causes driving these effects and examine how defensive GNN models perform under graph reduction, offering practical insights for designing robust GNNs within graph acceleration systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Merging for Enhancing the Link Stealing Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05830v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically designed to process the graph data, have achieved remarkable success in various applications. Link stealing attacks on graph data pose a significant privacy threat, as attackers aim to extract sensitive relationships between nodes (entities), potentially leading to academic misconduct, fraudulent transactions, or other malicious activities. Previous studies have primarily focused on single datasets and did not explore cross-dataset attacks, let alone attacks that leverage the combined knowledge of multiple attackers. However, we find that an attacker can combine the data knowledge of multiple attackers to create a more effective attack model, which can be referred to cross-dataset attacks. Moreover, if knowledge can be extracted with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the attack capability will be more significant. In this paper, we propose a novel link stealing attack method that takes advantage of cross-dataset and Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM is applied to process datasets with different data structures in cross-dataset attacks. Each attacker fine-tunes the LLM on their specific dataset to generate a tailored attack model. We then introduce a novel model merging method to integrate the parameters of these attacker-specific models effectively. The result is a merged attack model with superior generalization capabilities, enabling effective attacks not only on the attackers' datasets but also on previously unseen (out-of-domain) datasets. We conducted extensive experiments in four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additional experiments with three different GNN and LLM architectures further illustrate the generality of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link Stealing Attacks, Large Language Models, Graph Neural Networks, Privacy Attacks, Model Merging</p></details> |

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named BEV-SUSHI, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, BEV-SUSHI has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed BEV-SUSHI establishes the new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with 81.22 HOTA, and 95.6 IDF1 on the WildTrack dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the II edition of the Workshop on Unifying Representations in Neural Models (UniReps 2024)</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |

While traditional approaches like queuing theory and packet-level simulation have served as foundational tools, they face limitations in modeling complex traffic behaviors and scaling to large networks. This project presents an extended implementation of RouteNet-Fermi, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed for network performance prediction, with additional recurrent neural network variants. We improve the the original architecture by implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cells alongside the existing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells implementation. This work contributes to the understanding of recurrent neural architectures in GNN-based network modeling and provides a flexible framework for future experimentation with different cell types.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Precise sales forecasts for unreleased items could drastically improve the efficiency and profits of industries. However, predicting the success of entirely new styles is difficult due to the absence of past data and ever-changing trends. Specifically, currently used deterministic models struggle with domain shifts when encountering items outside their training data. The recently proposed diffusion models address this issue using a continuous-time diffusion process. Specifically, these models enable us to predict the sales of new items, mitigating the domain shift challenges encountered by deterministic models. As a result, this paper proposes Dif4FF, a novel two-stage pipeline for New Fashion Product Performance Forecasting (NFPPF) that leverages the power of diffusion models conditioned on multimodal data related to specific clothes. Dif4FF first utilizes a multimodal score-based diffusion model to forecast multiple sales trajectories for various garments over time. The forecasts are refined using a powerful Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture. By leveraging the GCN's capability to capture long-range dependencies within both the temporal and spatial data and seeking the optimal solution between these two dimensions, Dif4FF offers the most accurate and efficient forecasting system available in the literature for predicting the sales of new items. We tested Dif4FF on VISUELLE, the de facto standard for NFPPF, achieving new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 27th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)</p></details> |

Specifically, in the industrial GUI-to-code process, fragmented layers may decrease the readability and maintainability of generated code, which can be alleviated by grouping semantically consistent fragmented layers in the design prototypes. This study aims to propose a graph-learning-based approach to tackle the fragmented layer grouping problem according to multi-modal information in design prototypes. Our graph learning module consists of self-attention and graph neural network modules. By taking the multimodal fused representation of GUI layers as input, we innovatively group fragmented layers by classifying GUI layers and regressing the bounding boxes of the corresponding GUI components simultaneously. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. A further user study is also conducted to validate that our approach can assist an intelligent downstream tool in generating more maintainable and readable front-end code.</p></details> | 28 pages,6 figures |
| **[Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt Learning for Urban Flow Prediction under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05534v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban flow prediction is a classic spatial-temporal forecasting task that estimates the amount of future traffic flow for a given location. Though models represented by Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have established themselves as capable predictors, they tend to suffer from distribution shifts that are common with the urban flow data due to the dynamics and unpredictability of spatial-temporal events. Unfortunately, in spatial-temporal applications, the dynamic environments can hardly be quantified via a fixed number of parameters, whereas learning time- and location-specific environments can quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt learning (MIP) for urban flow prediction under constant distribution shifts. Specifically, MIP is equipped with a learnable memory bank that is trained to memorize the causal features within the spatial-temporal graph. By querying a trainable memory bank that stores the causal features, we adaptively extract invariant and variant prompts (i.e., patterns) for a given location at every time step. Then, instead of intervening the raw data based on simulated environments, we directly perform intervention on variant prompts across space and time. With the intervened variant prompts in place, we use invariant learning to minimize the variance of predictions, so as to ensure that the predictions are only made with invariant features. With extensive comparative experiments on two public urban flow datasets, we thoroughly demonstrate the robustness of MIP against OOD data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Homophilic Graph Pre-Training and Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12594v4)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex relationships between objects across various fields. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We delineate a novel State Augmentation (SA) strategy to maximize the aggregate information at source nodes using graph neural network (GNN) architectures, by deploying graph convolutions over the topological links of the communication network. The proposed technique leverages only the local information available at each node and efficiently routes desired information to the destination nodes. We leverage an unsupervised learning procedure to convert the output of the GNN architecture to optimal information routing strategies. In the experiments, we perform the evaluation on real-time network topologies to validate our algorithms. Numerical simulations depict the improved performance of the proposed method in training a GNN parameterization as compared to baseline algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[An end-to-end attention-based approach for learning on graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10793v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent surge in transformer-based architectures for learning on graphs, mainly motivated by attention as an effective learning mechanism and the desire to supersede handcrafted operators characteristic of message passing schemes. However, concerns over their empirical effectiveness, scalability, and complexity of the pre-processing steps have been raised, especially in relation to much simpler graph neural networks that typically perform on par with them across a wide range of benchmarks. To tackle these shortcomings, we consider graphs as sets of edges and propose a purely attention-based approach consisting of an encoder and an attention pooling mechanism. The encoder vertically interleaves masked and vanilla self-attention modules to learn an effective representations of edges, while allowing for tackling possible misspecifications in input graphs. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms fine-tuned message passing baselines and recently proposed transformer-based methods on more than 70 node and graph-level tasks, including challenging long-range benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different tasks, ranging from molecular to vision graphs, and heterophilous node classification. The approach also outperforms graph neural networks and transformers in transfer learning settings, and scales much better than alternatives with a similar performance level or expressive power.</p></details> |  |

They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural network-based entity alignment methods have achieved promising results in Euclidean space. However, KGs often contain complex structures, including both local and hierarchical ones, which make it challenging to efficiently represent them within a single space. In this paper, we proposed a novel method UniEA, which unifies dual-space embedding to preserve the intrinsic structure of KGs. Specifically, we learn graph structure embedding in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces simultaneously to maximize the consistency between the embedding in both spaces. Moreover, we employ contrastive learning to mitigate the misalignment issues caused by similar entities, where embedding of similar neighboring entities within the KG become too close in distance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in structure-based EA.

Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve JSSPs, albeit lacking a systematic survey of the relevant literature. This paper aims to thoroughly review prevailing GNN methods for different types of JSSPs and the closely related flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), especially those leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities. We hope this survey can motivate and inspire innovative approaches for more powerful GNN-based approaches in tackling JSSPs and other scheduling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computers & Operations Research</p></details> |

Due to both hardware advancements and limitations in current software stacks, the need for data efficiency has risen. Data efficiency refers to the effective hiding of data access latency and the avoidance of unnecessary data movements. Major challenges arise from the growing disparity between GPU memory bandwidth and computational throughput, imminent GPU memory capacity limitations, and inefficiencies in the PyTorch software stack, including a lack of device-specific PCIe transfer optimizations and high-level domain-specific abstractions. To effectively mitigate these data inefficiencies for deep learning training, this dissertation analyzes data inefficiency in representative deep training tasks, specifically in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). It then proposes novel runtime and code generation techniques to mitigate these challenges and implements these optimizations seamlessly within the PyTorch stack while maintaining strong programmability and interoperability. First, PyTorch-Direct is devised to incorporate the GPU-centric PCIe data transfer paradigm in PyTorch for GNN training. Next, Hector intermediate representation (IR) and its code generator are proposed to introduce domain-specific high-level abstraction and systematically address memory-intensive performance challenges for relational GNNs. Finally, in LLM training, the throughput has been increasingly constrained by GPU memory capacity. To mitigate this, the SSDTrain offloading framework is designed and implemented. Together, these contributions show that code generation and runtime techniques can systematically mitigate the data management bottlenecks in deep learning training, which stem from the data-intensive nature of workloads and the oversimplification inherent in the deep learning training software stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ph.D....</summary><p>Ph.D. Thesis, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2024</p></details> |

To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

However, due to many state-of-the-art approaches relying on uninterpretable black-box models, there is growing demand for methods that offer stakeholders clear and actionable insights into their latent beliefs and motivations. To address this, we evaluate Theory of Mind (ToM) approaches for Autonomous Cyber Operations. Upon learning a robust prior, ToM models can predict an agent's goals, behaviours, and contextual beliefs given only a handful of past behaviour observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based ToM architecture tailored for cyber-defence, Graph-In, Graph-Out (GIGO)-ToM, which can accurately predict both the targets and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents over arbitrary computer network topologies. To evaluate the latter, we propose a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance for measuring the similarity of graph-based probability distributions. Whereas the standard Wasserstein distance lacks a fixed reference scale, we introduce a graph-theoretic normalization factor that enables a standardized comparison between networks of different sizes. We furnish this metric, which we term the Network Transport Distance (NTD), with a weighting function that emphasizes predictions according to custom node features, allowing network operators to explore arbitrary strategic considerations. Benchmarked against a Graph-In, Dense-Out (GIDO)-ToM architecture in an abstract cyber-defence environment, our empirical evaluations show that GIGO-ToM can accurately predict the goals and behaviours of various unseen cyber-attacking agents across a range of network topologies, as well as learn embeddings that can effectively characterize their policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 17 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01910v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo & al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel method that integrates both approaches for enhanced performance. Our framework uses Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based and sequential recommenders as separate submodules while sharing a unified embedding space optimized jointly. To enable positive knowledge transfer, we design a loss function that enforces alignment and uniformity both within and across submodules.

Despite their successful and diverse applications, oversmoothing prohibits deep architectures due to node features converging to a single fixed point. This severely limits their potential to solve complex tasks. To counteract this tendency, we propose a plug-and-play module consisting of three steps: Cluster-Normalize-Activate (CNA). By applying CNA modules, GNNs search and form super nodes in each layer, which are normalized and activated individually. We demonstrate in node classification and property prediction tasks that CNA significantly improves the accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Particularly, CNA reaches 94.18% and 95.75% accuracy on Cora and CiteSeer, respectively. It further benefits GNNs in regression tasks as well, reducing the mean squared error compared to all baselines. At the same time, GNNs with CNA require substantially fewer learnable parameters than competing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Disentangle Causal Model: Enhancing Causal Inference in Networked Observational Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03913v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) from observational data is a critical task across various domains. However, many existing works on ITE estimation overlook the influence of hidden confounders, which remain unobserved at the individual unit level. To address this limitation, researchers have utilized graph neural networks to aggregate neighbors' features to capture the hidden confounders and mitigate confounding bias by minimizing the discrepancy of confounder representations between the treated and control groups. Despite the success of these approaches, practical scenarios often treat all features as confounders and involve substantial differences in feature distributions between the treated and control groups. Confusing the adjustment and confounder and enforcing strict balance on the confounder representations could potentially undermine the effectiveness of outcome prediction. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework called the \textit{Graph Disentangle Causal model} (GDC) to conduct ITE estimation in the network setting. GDC utilizes a causal disentangle module to separate unit features into adjustment and confounder representations. Then we design a graph aggregation module consisting of three distinct graph aggregators to obtain adjustment, confounder, and counterfactual confounder representations. Finally, a causal constraint module is employed to enforce the disentangled representations as true causal factors. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by conducting comprehensive experiments on two networked datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03864v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

| **[Online Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13966v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation, a technique recently gaining popularity for enhancing model generalization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), operates under the assumption that both teacher and student models are trained on identical data distributions. However, its effect on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is less than satisfactory since the graph topology and node attributes are prone to evolve, thereby leading to the issue of distribution shift. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by simultaneously training a group of graph neural networks in an online distillation fashion, where the group knowledge plays a role as a dynamic virtual teacher and the structure changes in graph neural networks are effectively captured. To improve the distillation performance, two types of knowledge are transferred among the students to enhance each other: local knowledge reflecting information in the graph topology and node attributes, and global knowledge reflecting the prediction over classes. We transfer the global knowledge with KL-divergence as the vanilla knowledge distillation does, while exploiting the complicated structure of the local knowledge with an efficient adversarial cyclic learning framework. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our proposed online adversarial distillation approach. The code is published at https://github.com/wangz3066/OnlineDistillGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)</p></details> |

While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>12-pa...</summary><p>12-page main paper + 8-page appendix</p></details> |

However, existing datasets primarily focus on detecting severe crimes by analyzing entire video clips, often neglecting the precursor activities (i.e., privacy violations) that could potentially prevent these crimes. To address this limitation, we present PV-VTT (Privacy Violation Video To Text), a unique multimodal dataset aimed at identifying privacy violations. PV-VTT provides detailed annotations for both video and text in scenarios. To ensure the privacy of individuals in the videos, we only provide video feature vectors, avoiding the release of any raw video data. This privacy-focused approach allows researchers to use the dataset while protecting participant confidentiality. Recognizing that privacy violations are often ambiguous and context-dependent, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based video description model. Our model generates a GNN-based prompt with image for Large Language Model (LLM), which deliver cost-effective and high-quality video descriptions. By leveraging a single video frame along with relevant text, our method reduces the number of input tokens required, maintaining descriptive quality while optimizing LLM API-usage. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach in video description tasks and flexibility of our PV-VTT dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025, Dataset Available Here : https://ryozomasukawa.github.io/PV-VTT.github.io/</p></details> |

My dissertation focuses on developing intrinsically interpretable models when using LMs as encoders while maintaining their superior performance via prototypical networks. I initiated my research by investigating enhancements in performance for interpretable models of sarcasm detection. My proposed approach focuses on capturing sentiment incongruity to enhance accuracy while offering instance-based explanations for the classification decisions. Later, I developed a novel white-box multi-head graph attention-based prototype network designed to explain the decisions of text classification models without sacrificing the accuracy of the original black-box LMs. In addition, I am working on extending the attention-based prototype network with contrastive learning to redesign an interpretable graph neural network, aiming to enhance both the interpretability and performance of the model in document classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, accepted by AAAI25 DC</p></details> |

These graph-based representations, when combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), have shown promise in developing high-performance malware detectors. However, challenges remain due to the large size of these graphs and the inherent opacity in the decision-making process of GNNs. This paper addresses these issues by developing several graph reduction techniques to reduce graph size and applying the state-of-the-art GNNExplainer to enhance the interpretability of GNN outputs. The analysis demonstrates that integrating our proposed graph reduction technique along with GNNExplainer in the malware detection framework significantly reduces graph size while preserving high performance, providing an effective balance between efficiency and transparency in malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Data Integration for Bike-sharing Demand Prediction with Graph Neural Networks in Degraded Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03307v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand for bike sharing is impacted by various factors, such as weather conditions, events, and the availability of other transportation modes. This impact remains elusive due to the complex interdependence of these factors or locationrelated user behavior variations. It is also not clear which factor is additional information which are not already contained in the historical demand. Intermodal dependencies between bike-sharing and other modes are also underexplored, and the value of this information has not been studied in degraded situations. The proposed study analyzes the impact of adding contextual data, such as weather, time embedding, and road traffic flow, to predict bike-sharing Origin-Destination (OD) flows in atypical weather situations Our study highlights a mild relationship between prediction quality of bike-sharing demand and road traffic flow, while the introduced time embedding allows outperforming state-of-the-art results, particularly in the case of degraded weather conditions. Including weather data as an additional input further improves our model with respect to the basic ST-ED-RMGC prediction model by reducing of more than 20% the prediction error in degraded weather condition.</p></details> |  |

While Graph neural networks have been used for various applications, their adaptivity to reject option setting is not previously explored. In this paper, we propose NCwR, a novel approach to node classification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with an integrated reject option, which allows the model to abstain from making predictions when uncertainty is high. We propose both cost-based and coverage-based methods for classification with abstention in node classification setting using GNNs. We perform experiments using our method on three standard citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed and compare with relevant baselines. We also model the Legal judgment prediction problem on ILDC dataset as a node classification problem where nodes represent legal cases and edges represent citations. We further interpret the model by analyzing the cases that the model abstains from predicting by visualizing which part of the input features influenced this decision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |

Spontaneous motor activity, or 'kinetics', is shown to provide a powerful surrogate measure of upcoming neurodevelopment. However, its assessment is by and large qualitative and subjective, focusing on visually identified, age-specific gestures. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Age (KA), a novel data-driven metric that quantifies neurodevelopmental maturity by predicting an infant's age based on their movement patterns. KA offers an interpretable and generalizable proxy for motor development. Our method leverages 3D video recordings of infants, processed with pose estimation to extract spatio-temporal series of anatomical landmarks, which are released as a new openly available dataset. These data are modeled using adaptive graph convolutional networks, able to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies in infant movements. We also show that our data-driven approach achieves improvement over traditional machine learning baselines based on manually engineered features.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures.

The proposed approach introduces three GNN-based recommendation models, specifically designed to mitigate over-smoothing through innovative mechanisms like residual connections and identity mapping within the aggregation propagation process. These modifications enable more effective information flow across layers, preserving essential user-item interaction details to improve recommendation accuracy. Additionally, the study emphasizes the critical need for interpretability in recommendation systems, aiming to provide transparent and justifiable suggestions tailored to dynamic user preferences. By integrating collaborative filtering with GNN architectures, the proposed models not only enhance predictive accuracy but also align recommendations more closely with individual behaviors, adapting to nuanced shifts in user interests. This work advances the field by tackling both technical and user-centric challenges, contributing to the development of robust and explainable recommendation systems capable of managing the complexity and scale of modern online environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale Invariance of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19392v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address two fundamental challenges in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): (1) the lack of theoretical support for invariance learning, a critical property in image processing, and (2) the absence of a unified model capable of excelling on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets. To tackle these issues, we establish and prove scale invariance in graphs, extending this key property to graph learning, and validate it through experiments on real-world datasets. Leveraging directed multi-scaled graphs and an adaptive self-loop strategy, we propose ScaleNet, a unified network architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance across four homophilic and two heterophilic benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that through graph transformation based on scale invariance, uniform weights can replace computationally expensive edge weights in digraph inception networks while maintaining or improving performance. For another popular GNN approach to digraphs, we demonstrate the equivalence between Hermitian Laplacian methods and GraphSAGE with incidence normalization. ScaleNet bridges the gap between homophilic and heterophilic graph learning, offering both theoretical insights into scale invariance and practical advancements in unified graph learning.

However, existing GNN- based approaches often overlook or do not explicitly exploit geographic position information, which often plays a critical role in understanding spatial dependencies. This is also aligned with our observation, where accident locations are often highly relevant. To address this issue, we propose a plug-in-and-play module for common GNN frameworks, termed Geographic Information Alignment (GIA). This module can efficiently fuse the node feature and geographic position information through a novel Transpose Cross-attention mechanism. Due to the large number of nodes for traffic data, the conventional cross-attention mechanism performing the node-wise alignment may be infeasible in computation-limited resources. Instead, we take the transpose operation for Query, Key, and Value in the Cross-attention mechanism, which substantially reduces the computation cost while maintaining sufficient information. Experimental results for both traffic occurrence prediction and severity prediction (severity levels based on the interval of recorded crash counts) on large-scale city-wise datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our method can obtain gains ranging from 1.3% to 10.9% in F1 score and 0.3% to 4.8% in AUC.</p></details> |  |

This opens up new possibilities for enhancing whole slide image (WSI) prediction tasks with localized gene expression. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage the interactions between different tissue locations, which are crucial for accurate joint prediction. To address this, we introduce MERGE (Multi-faceted hiErarchical gRaph for Gene Expressions), which combines a multi-faceted hierarchical graph construction strategy with graph neural networks (GNN) to improve gene expression predictions from WSIs. By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections. We advocate for adopting gene-aware smoothing methods that are more biologically justified. Experimental results on gene expression prediction show that our GNN method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 8 pages, Supplementary Material: 9 pages, Figures: 16</p></details> |

In this paper, we examine the downlink performance of cell-free mMIMO systems equipped with mobile-APs utilizing the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles, where mobility and power control are jointly considered to effectively enhance coverage and suppress interference. However, the high computational complexity, poor collaboration, limited scalability, and uneven reward distribution of conventional optimization schemes lead to serious performance degradation and instability. These factors complicate the provision of consistent and high-quality service across all user equipments in downlink cell-free mMIMO systems. Consequently, we propose a novel scalable framework enhanced by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle these challenges. The established framework incorporates a graph neural network (GNN)-aided communication mechanism to facilitate effective collaboration among agents, a permutation architecture to improve scalability, and a directional decoupling architecture to accurately distinguish contributions. In the numerical results, we present comparisons of different optimization schemes and network architectures, which reveal that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance system performance compared to conventional schemes due to the adoption of advanced technologies. In particular, appropriately compressing the observation space of agents is beneficial for achieving a better balance between performance and convergence.</p></details> |  |

We prove that the graph queries that can be computed by a polynomial-size bounded-depth family of GNNs are exactly those definable in the guarded fragment GFO+C of first-order logic with counting and with built-in relations. This puts GNNs in the circuit complexity class (non-uniform) $\text{TC}^0$. Remarkably, the GNN families may use arbitrary real weights and a wide class of activation functions that includes the standard ReLU, logistic "sigmoid", and hyperbolic tangent functions. If the GNNs are allowed to use random initialisation and global readout (both standard features of GNNs widely used in practice), they can compute exactly the same queries as bounded depth Boolean circuits with threshold gates, that is, exactly the queries in $\text{TC}^0$. Moreover, we show that queries computable by a single GNN with piecewise linear activations and rational weights are definable in GFO+C without built-in relations. Therefore, they are contained in uniform $\text{TC}^0$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal version for TheoretiCS</p></details> |

However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. With this modification, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties, characterizing order and disorder in multicomponent oxides, and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stability of complex materials systems.</p></details> |  |

Through the encoding-decoding structure, the autoencoder can capture the data's potential characteristics and achieve noise reduction and anomaly detection, providing an efficient and stable solution for the data mining process. The experiment compared the performance of the autoencoder with traditional dimensionality reduction methods (such as PCA, FA, T-SNE, and UMAP). The results showed that the autoencoder performed best in terms of reconstruction error and root mean square error and could better retain data structure and enhance the generalization ability of the model. The autoencoder-based framework not only reduces manual intervention but also significantly improves the automation of data processing. In the future, with the advancement of deep learning and big data technology, the autoencoder method combined with a generative adversarial network (GAN) or graph neural network (GNN) is expected to be more widely used in the fields of complex data processing, real-time data analysis and intelligent decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 15 pages |

It integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and graph neural networks (GNN) in code design by modeling the generation of code parity-check matrices as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), to optimize key coding performance metrics such as error-rates and code algebraic properties. An edge-weighted GNN (EW-GNN) decoder is proposed, which operates on the Tanner graph with an iterative message-passing structure. Once trained on a single linear block code, the EW-GNN decoder can be directly used to decode other linear block codes of different code lengths and code rates. An iterative joint training of the DRL-based code designer and the EW-GNN decoder is performed to optimize the end-end encoding and decoding process. Simulation results show the proposed auto-encoder significantly surpasses several traditional coding schemes at short block lengths, including low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the belief propagation (BP) decoding and the maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), and BCH with BP decoding, offering superior error-correction capabilities while maintaining low decoding complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; submitted to IEEE Trans. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2211.06962</p></details> |

However, most GNN architectures perform well on homophilic datasets, where the labels of neighboring nodes are likely to be the same. In recent years, an increasing body of work has been devoted to the development of GNN architectures for heterophilic datasets, where labels do not exhibit this low-pass behavior. In this work, we create a new graph in which nodes are connected if they share structural characteristics, meaning a higher chance of sharing their labels, and then use this new graph in the GNN architecture. To do this, we compute the k-nearest neighbors graph according to distances between structural features, which are either (i) role-based, such as degree, or (ii) global, such as centrality measures. Experiments show that the labels are smoother in this newly defined graph and that the performance of GNN architectures improves when using this alternative structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented as a conference paper in the Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2024</p></details> |

While end-to-end diarization systems attempt to learn a single model for the task, they are often cumbersome to train and require large supervised datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm based on graph neural networks (GNN), called End-to-end Supervised HierARchical Clustering (E-SHARC). The embedding extractor is initialized using a pre-trained x-vector model while the GNN model is trained initially using the x-vector embeddings from the pre-trained model. Finally, the E-SHARC model uses the front-end mel-filterbank features as input and jointly optimizes the embedding extractor and the GNN clustering module, performing representation learning, metric learning, and clustering with end-to-end optimization. Further, with additional inputs from an external overlap detector, the E-SHARC approach is capable of predicting the speakers in the overlapping speech regions.

| **[DGNN-YOLO: Dynamic Graph Neural Networks with YOLO11 for Small Object Detection and Tracking in Traffic Surveillance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17251v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and tracking of small objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes are critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial in improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showcasing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This work provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, MPNNs face challenges such as under-reaching and over-squashing, where limited receptive fields and structural bottlenecks hinder information flow in the graph. While graph transformers hold promise in addressing these issues, their scalability is limited due to quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes, rendering them impractical for larger graphs. Here, we propose implicitly rewired message-passing neural networks (IPR-MPNNs), a novel approach that integrates implicit probabilistic graph rewiring into MPNNs. By introducing a small number of virtual nodes, i.e., adding additional nodes to a given graph and connecting them to existing nodes, in a differentiable, end-to-end manner, IPR-MPNNs enable long-distance message propagation, circumventing quadratic complexity. Theoretically, we demonstrate that IPR-MPNNs surpass the expressiveness of traditional MPNNs. Empirically, we validate our approach by showcasing its ability to mitigate under-reaching and over-squashing effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple graph datasets. Notably, IPR-MPNNs outperform graph transformers while maintaining significantly faster computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024), Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |

We begin by exploring the fundamental principles of both collaborative filtering and deep neural networks, laying the groundwork for understanding their integration. Subsequently, we review key advancements in the field, categorizing various deep learning models that enhance CF systems, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM).

Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</p></details> | 77 pages; 3 figures |
| **[Lossless and Privacy-Preserving Graph Convolution Network for Federated Item Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01141v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a state-of-the-art solution for item recommendation. However, existing GNN-based recommendation methods rely on a centralized storage of fragmented user-item interaction sub-graphs and training on an aggregated global graph, which will lead to privacy concerns. As a response, some recent works develop GNN-based federated recommendation methods by exploiting decentralized and fragmented user-item sub-graphs in order to preserve user privacy. However, due to privacy constraints, the graph convolution process in existing federated recommendation methods is incomplete compared with the centralized counterpart, causing a degradation of the recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lossless and privacy-preserving graph convolution network (LP-GCN), which fully completes the graph convolution process with decentralized user-item interaction sub-graphs while ensuring privacy. It is worth mentioning that its performance is equivalent to that of the non-federated (i.e., centralized) counterpart. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical studies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our LP-GCN outperforms the existing federated recommendation methods. The code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

Today, graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in neural algorithmic reasoners due to their message passing framework and permutation equivariance. In this extended abstract, we challenge this design choice, and replace the equivariant aggregation function with a recurrent neural network. While seemingly counter-intuitive, this approach has appropriate grounding when nodes have a natural ordering -- and this is the case frequently in established reasoning benchmarks like CLRS-30. Indeed, our recurrent NAR (RNAR) model performs very strongly on such tasks, while handling many others gracefully. A notable achievement of RNAR is its decisive state-of-the-art result on the Heapsort and Quickselect tasks, both deemed as a significant challenge for contemporary neural algorithmic reasoners -- especially the latter, where RNAR achieves a mean micro-F1 score of 87%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Third Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2024). 10 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Towards Dynamic Message Passing on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23686v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing plays a vital role in graph neural networks (GNNs) for effective feature learning. However, the over-reliance on input topology diminishes the efficacy of message passing and restricts the ability of GNNs. Despite efforts to mitigate the reliance, existing study encounters message-passing bottlenecks or high computational expense problems, which invokes the demands for flexible message passing with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic message-passing mechanism for GNNs. It projects graph nodes and learnable pseudo nodes into a common space with measurable spatial relations between them. With nodes moving in the space, their evolving relations facilitate flexible pathway construction for a dynamic message-passing process. Associating pseudo nodes to input graphs with their measured relations, graph nodes can communicate with each other intermediately through pseudo nodes under linear complexity. We further develop a GNN model named $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ based on our dynamic message-passing mechanism. $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ employs a single recurrent layer to recursively generate the displacements of nodes and construct optimal dynamic pathways. Evaluation on eighteen benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ over popular GNNs. $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ successfully scales to large-scale benchmarks and requires significantly fewer parameters for graph classification with the shared recurrent layer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models as Interpolated and Extrapolated Event Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10492v2)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient facts of sociopolitical events are distilled into quadruples following a format of subject, relation, object, and timestamp. Machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been built to make predictions and infer relations on the quadruple-based knowledge graphs (KGs). In many applications, quadruples are extended to quintuples with auxiliary attributes such as text summaries that describe the quadruple events. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate how large language models (LLMs) streamline the design of event prediction frameworks using quadruple-based or quintuple-based data while maintaining competitive accuracy. We propose LEAP, a unified framework that leverages large language models as event predictors. Specifically, we develop multiple prompt templates to frame the object prediction (OP) task as a standard question-answering (QA) task, suitable for instruction fine-tuning with an encoder-decoder LLM. For multi-event forecasting (MEF) task, we design a simple yet effective prompt template for each event quintuple. This novel approach removes the need for GNNs and RNNs, instead utilizing an encoder-only LLM to generate fixed intermediate embeddings, which are processed by a customized downstream head with a self-attention mechanism to predict potential relation occurrences in the future. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00537v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are highly vulnerable to label flipping, i.e., the adversarial modification (poisoning) of training labels to compromise performance. Thus, deriving robustness certificates is important to guarantee that test predictions remain unaffected and to understand worst-case robustness behavior. However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the problem of certifying label flipping has so far been unsolved. We change this by introducing an exact certification method, deriving both sample-wise and collective certificates. Our method leverages the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to capture the training dynamics of wide networks enabling us to reformulate the bilevel optimization problem representing label flipping into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). We apply our method to certify a broad range of GNN architectures in node classification tasks. Thereby, concerning the worst-case robustness to label flipping: $(i)$ we establish hierarchies of GNNs on different benchmark graphs; $(ii)$ quantify the effect of architectural choices such as activations, depth and skip-connections; and surprisingly, $(iii)$ uncover a novel phenomenon of the robustness plateauing for intermediate perturbation budgets across all investigated datasets and architectures. While we focus on GNNs, our certificates are applicable to sufficiently wide NNs in general through their NTK. Thus, our work presents the first exact certificate to a poisoning attack ever derived for neural networks, which could be of independent interest.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Self-Explainable Heterogeneous GNN for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00521v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, significant attention has been given to the idea of viewing relational databases as heterogeneous graphs, enabling the application of graph neural network (GNN) technology for predictive tasks. However, existing GNN methods struggle with the complexity of the heterogeneous graphs induced by databases with numerous tables and relations. Traditional approaches either consider all possible relational meta-paths, thus failing to scale with the number of relations, or rely on domain experts to identify relevant meta-paths. A recent solution does manage to learn informative meta-paths without expert supervision, but assumes that a node's class depends solely on the existence of a meta-path occurrence. In this work, we present a self-explainable heterogeneous GNN for relational data, that supports models in which class membership depends on aggregate information obtained from multiple occurrences of a meta-path. Experimental results show that in the context of relational databases, our approach effectively identifies informative meta-paths that faithfully capture the model's reasoning mechanisms. It significantly outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenario.</p></details> |  |

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P&ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00382v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02054v3)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep graph models (e.g., graph neural networks and graph transformers) have become important techniques for leveraging knowledge across various types of graphs. Yet, the neural scaling laws on graphs, i.e., how the performance of deep graph models changes with model and dataset sizes, have not been systematically investigated, casting doubts on the feasibility of achieving large graph models. To fill this gap, we benchmark many graph datasets from different tasks and make an attempt to establish the neural scaling laws on graphs from both model and data perspectives. The model size we investigated is up to 100 million parameters, and the dataset size investigated is up to 50 million samples. We first verify the validity of such laws on graphs, establishing proper formulations to describe the scaling behaviors. For model scaling, we identify that despite the parameter numbers, the model depth also plays an important role in affecting the model scaling behaviors, which differs from observations in other domains such as CV and NLP. For data scaling, we suggest that the number of graphs can not effectively measure the graph data volume in scaling law since the sizes of different graphs are highly irregular. Instead, we reform the data scaling law with the number of nodes or edges as the metric to address the irregular graph sizes. We further demonstrate that the reformed law offers a unified view of the data scaling behaviors for various fundamental graph tasks including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. This work provides valuable insights into neural scaling laws on graphs, which can serve as an important tool for collecting new graph data and developing large graph models.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Model for One Graph: A New Perspective for Pretraining with Cross-domain Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00315v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to capture intricate network patterns, achieving success across different domains. However, existing GNNs require careful domain-specific architecture designs and training from scratch on each dataset, leading to an expertise-intensive process with difficulty in generalizing across graphs from different domains. Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, "one model for one graph," which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both link prediction and node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

In its most realistic setting, the problem consists of predicting missing or future links between random pairs of nodes from the set of disconnected pairs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the predominant framework for link prediction. GNN-based methods treat link prediction as a binary classification problem and handle the extreme class imbalance -- real graphs are very sparse -- by sampling (uniformly at random) a balanced number of disconnected pairs not only for training but also for evaluation. However, we show that the reported performance of GNNs for link prediction in the balanced setting does not translate to the more realistic imbalanced setting and that simpler topology-based approaches are often better at handling sparsity. These findings motivate Gelato, a similarity-based link-prediction method that applies (1) graph learning based on node attributes to enhance a topological heuristic, (2) a ranking loss for addressing class imbalance, and (3) a negative sampling scheme that efficiently selects hard training pairs via graph partitioning. Experiments show that Gelato outperforms existing GNN-based alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 31st SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - Research Track (August 2024 Deadline)</p></details> |

Standard GNNs, designed for simple graphs, compute node representations by combining all connected edges at once, without distinguishing between edges from different neighbors. There are some GNN architectures proposed specifically for multigraph tasks, yet these architectures perform only node-level aggregation in their message-passing layers, which limits their expressive power. Furthermore, these approaches either lack permutation equivariance when a strict total edge ordering is absent, or fail to preserve the topological structure of the multigraph. To address all these shortcomings, we propose MEGA-GNN, a unified framework for message passing on multigraphs that can effectively perform diverse graph learning tasks. Our approach introduces a two-stage aggregation process in the message passing layers: first, parallel edges are aggregated, followed by a node-level aggregation that operates on aggregated messages from distinct neighbors. We show that MEGA-GNN supports permutation equivariance and invariance properties. We also show that MEGA-GNN is universal given a strict total order on the edges. Experiments on synthetic and real-world financial transaction datasets demonstrate that MEGA-GNN either significantly outperforms or is on par with the accuracy of state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Here, we introduce MIRO (Multimodal Integration through Relational Optimization), an algorithm that uses recurrent graph neural networks to transform the point clouds in order to improve clustering efficiency when applying conventional clustering techniques. We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture. In addition, MIRO's robust clustering capabilities hold promise for applications in various fields such as neuroscience, for the analysis of neural connectivity patterns, and environmental science, for studying spatial distributions of ecological data.</p></details> |  |

Most existing MERC methods assume each utterance has complete modalities, overlooking the common issue of incomplete modalities in real-world scenarios. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved notable results in Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (IMERC). However, traditional GNNs focus on binary relationships between nodes, limiting their ability to capture more complex, higher-order information. Moreover, repeated message passing can cause over-smoothing, reducing their capacity to preserve essential high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose a Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (SDR-GNN) for incomplete multimodal learning in conversational emotion recognition. SDR-GNN constructs an utterance semantic interaction graph using a sliding window based on both speaker and context relationships to model emotional dependencies. To capture higher-order and high-frequency information, SDR-GNN utilizes weighted relationship aggregation, ensuring consistent semantic feature extraction across utterances. Additionally, it performs multi-frequency aggregation in the spectral domain, enabling efficient recovery of incomplete modalities by extracting both high- and low-frequency information. Finally, multi-head attention is applied to fuse and optimize features for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach is effective in incomplete multimodal learning and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning.\url{https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/}</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) and a Graph Transformer (GT) to predict the incidence of heart failure (HF) on a patient similarity graph at the next hospital visit. Materials and Methods: We used electronic health records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset and applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to create a patient similarity graph using embeddings from diagnoses, procedures, and medications. Three models - GraphSAGE, Graph Attention Network (GAT), and Graph Transformer (GT) - were implemented to predict HF incidence. Model performance was evaluated using F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC metrics, and results were compared against baseline algorithms. An interpretability analysis was performed to understand the model's decision-making process. Results: The GT model demonstrated the best performance (F1 score: 0.5361, AUROC: 0.7925, AUPRC: 0.5168). Although the Random Forest (RF) baseline achieved a similar AUPRC value, the GT model offered enhanced interpretability due to the use of patient relationships in the graph structure. A joint analysis of attention weights, graph connectivity, and clinical features provided insight into model predictions across different classification groups. Discussion and Conclusion: Graph-based approaches such as GNNs provide an effective framework for predicting HF. By leveraging a patient similarity graph, GNNs can capture complex relationships in EHR data, potentially improving prediction accuracy and clinical interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our proposed approach, named Powerformer, develops a dedicated section-adaptive attention mechanism, separating itself from the self-attention used in conventional transformers. This mechanism effectively integrates power system states with transmission section information, which facilitates the development of robust state representations. Furthermore, by considering the graph topology of power system and the electrical attributes of bus nodes, we introduce two customized strategies to further enhance the expressiveness: graph neural network propagation and multi-factor attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three power system scenarios, including the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a large-scale European system with 9241 buses, where Powerformer demonstrates its superior performance over several baseline methods.</p></details> | 8 figures |

Primal heuristics, which reduce the search space of MILP, have enabled traditional solvers (e.g., Gurobi) to efficiently find high-quality solutions. However, traditional primal heuristics rely on expert knowledge, motivating the advent of machine learning (ML)-based primal heuristics that learn repetitive patterns in MILP. Nonetheless, existing ML-based primal heuristics do not guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) and primarily focus on prediction for binary decision variables. When addressing MILP involving non-binary integer variables using ML-based approaches, feasibility issues can become even more pronounced. Since finding an optimal solution requires satisfying all constraints, addressing feasibility is critical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that interacts with MILP to find feasible solutions, rather than delegating sub-problems to traditional solvers. We design reward functions tailored for MILP, which enables the RL agent to learn relationships between decision variables and constraints. Additionally, to effectively model complex relationships among decision variables, we leverage a Transformer encoder-based graph neural network (GNN). Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can solve MILP problems and find near-optimal solutions without delegating the remainder to traditional solvers. The proposed method provides a meaningful step forward as an initial study in solving MILP problems end-to-end based solely on ML.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextGNN: Beyond Two-Tower Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19513v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems predominantly utilize two-tower architectures, which evaluate user-item rankings through the inner product of their respective embeddings. However, one key limitation of two-tower models is that they learn a pair-agnostic representation of users and items. In contrast, pair-wise representations either scale poorly due to their quadratic complexity or are too restrictive on the candidate pairs to rank. To address these issues, we introduce Context-based Graph Neural Networks (ContextGNNs), a novel deep learning architecture for link prediction in recommendation systems. The method employs a pair-wise representation technique for familiar items situated within a user's local subgraph, while leveraging two-tower representations to facilitate the recommendation of exploratory items. A final network then predicts how to fuse both pair-wise and two-tower recommendations into a single ranking of items. We demonstrate that ContextGNN is able to adapt to different data characteristics and outperforms existing methods, both traditional and GNN-based, on a diverse set of practical recommendation tasks, improving performance by 20% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19507v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide critical insights for applications in disease diagnosis and healthcare. However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Inversion Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19440v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph federated learning is of essential importance for training over large graph datasets while protecting data privacy, where each client stores a subset of local graph data, while the server collects the local gradients and broadcasts only the aggregated gradients. Recent studies reveal that a malicious attacker can steal private image data from gradient exchanging of neural networks during federated learning. However, none of the existing works have studied the vulnerability of graph data and graph neural networks under such attack. To answer this question, the present paper studies the problem of whether private data can be recovered from leaked gradients in both node classification and graph classification tasks and { proposes a novel attack named Graph Leakage from Gradients (GLG)}. Two widely-used GNN frameworks are analyzed, namely GCN and GraphSAGE. The effects of different model settings on recovery are extensively discussed. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, it is shown that parts of the graph data can be leaked from the gradients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal graph neural networks for localized off-grid weather forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12938v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, weather forecast products from machine learning or numerical weather models are currently generated on a global regular grid, on which a naive interpolation cannot accurately reflect fine-grained weather patterns close to the ground. In this work, we train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. This multi-modal GNN takes advantage of local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature) to correct the gridded weather forecast at different lead times towards locally accurate forecasts. Each data modality is modeled as a different type of node in the graph. Using message passing, the node at the prediction location aggregates information from its heterogeneous neighbor nodes. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. Our approach demonstrates how the gap between global large-scale weather models and locally accurate predictions can be bridged to inform localized decision-making.</p></details> |  |
