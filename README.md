| **[Cloud gap-filling with deep learning for improved grassland monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09554v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uninterrupted optical image time series are crucial for the timely monitoring of agricultural land changes. However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose a deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using a combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. We emphasize the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated time series on the detection of grassland mowing events. We focus on Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compare our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method surpasses these techniques, with an average MAE of 0.024 and R^2 of 0.92. It not only improves the accuracy of event detection tasks by employing a continuous time series, but also effectively filters out sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations that cloud masks often fail to detect.</p></details> |  |
| **[iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series   Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625v4)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent boom of linear forecasting models questions the ongoing passion for architectural modifications of Transformer-based forecasters. These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates that represent potential delayed events and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent duties of Transformer components and repurpose the Transformer architecture without any modification to the basic components. We propose iTransformer that simply applies the attention and feed-forward network on the inverted dimensions. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves state-of-the-art on challenging real-world datasets, which further empowers the Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization ability across different variates, and better utilization of arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCformer: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Mixed-Channels   Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09223v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The massive generation of time-series data by largescale Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates the exploration of more effective models for multivariate time-series forecasting. In previous models, there was a predominant use of the Channel Dependence (CD) strategy (where each channel represents a univariate sequence). Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models primarily rely on the Channel Independence (CI) strategy. The CI strategy treats all channels as a single channel, expanding the dataset to improve generalization performance and avoiding inter-channel correlation that disrupts long-term features. However, the CI strategy faces the challenge of interchannel correlation forgetting. To address this issue, we propose an innovative Mixed Channels strategy, combining the data expansion advantages of the CI strategy with the ability to counteract inter-channel correlation forgetting. Based on this strategy, we introduce MCformer, a multivariate time-series forecasting model with mixed channel features. The model blends a specific number of channels, leveraging an attention mechanism to effectively capture inter-channel correlation information when modeling long-term features. Experimental results demonstrate that the Mixed Channels strategy outperforms pure CI strategy in multivariate time-series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-TS: Interpretable Diffusion for General Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01742v2)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are becoming the leading paradigm for generative models. It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04137v5)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot's visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 12 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models. Code, data, and training details is publicly available diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended journal version of the original RSS2023 paper</p></details> |
| **[DiTMoS: Delving into Diverse Tiny-Model Selection on Microcontrollers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09035v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling efficient and accurate deep neural network (DNN) inference on microcontrollers is non-trivial due to the constrained on-chip resources. Current methodologies primarily focus on compressing larger models yet at the expense of model accuracy. In this paper, we rethink the problem from the inverse perspective by constructing small/weak models directly and improving their accuracy. Thus, we introduce DiTMoS, a novel DNN training and inference framework with a selector-classifiers architecture, where the selector routes each input sample to the appropriate classifier for classification. DiTMoS is grounded on a key insight: a composition of weak models can exhibit high diversity and the union of them can significantly boost the accuracy upper bound. To approach the upper bound, DiTMoS introduces three strategies including diverse training data splitting to increase the classifiers' diversity, adversarial selector-classifiers training to ensure synergistic interactions thereby maximizing their complementarity, and heterogeneous feature aggregation to improve the capacity of classifiers. We further propose a network slicing technique to alleviate the extra memory overhead incurred by feature aggregation. We deploy DiTMoS on the Neucleo STM32F767ZI board and evaluate it based on three time-series datasets for human activity recognition, keywords spotting, and emotion recognition, respectively. The experiment results manifest that: (a) DiTMoS achieves up to 13.4% accuracy improvement compared to the best baseline; (b) network slicing almost completely eliminates the memory overhead incurred by feature aggregation with a marginal increase of latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Volatile Organic Compounds by Differential Mobility   Spectrometry Based on Continuity of Alpha Curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07066v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Classification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is of interest in many fields. Examples include but are not limited to medicine, detection of explosives, and food quality control. Measurements collected with electronic noses can be used for classification and analysis of VOCs. One type of electronic noses that has seen considerable development in recent years is Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS). DMS yields measurements that are visualized as dispersion plots that contain traces, also known as alpha curves. Current methods used for analyzing DMS dispersion plots do not usually utilize the information stored in the continuity of these traces, which suggests that alternative approaches should be investigated.   Results: In this work, for the first time, dispersion plots were interpreted as a series of measurements evolving sequentially. Thus, it was hypothesized that time-series classification algorithms can be effective for classification and analysis of dispersion plots. An extensive dataset of 900 dispersion plots for five chemicals measured at five flow rates and two concentrations was collected. The data was used to analyze the classification performance of six algorithms. According to our hypothesis, the highest classification accuracy of 88\% was achieved by a Long-Short Term Memory neural network, which supports our hypothesis.   Significance: A new concept for approaching classification tasks of dispersion plots is presented and compared with other well-known classification algorithms. This creates a new angle of view for analysis and classification of the dispersion plots. In addition, a new dataset of dispersion plots is openly shared to public.</p></details> |  |
| **[Covariance Fitting Interferometric Phase Linking: Modular Framework and   Optimization Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08646v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interferometric phase linking (IPL) has become a prominent technique for processing images of areas containing distributed scaterrers in SAR interferometry. Traditionally, IPL consists in estimating consistent phase differences between all pairs of SAR images in a time series from the sample covariance matrix of pixel patches on a sliding window. This paper reformulates this task as a covariance fitting problem: in this setup, IPL appears as a form of projection of an input covariance matrix so that it satisfies the phase closure property. Given this modular formulation, we propose an overview of covariance matrix estimates, regularization options, and matrix distances, that can be of interest when processing multi-temporal SAR data. In particular, we will observe that most of the existing IPL algorithms appear as special instances of this framework. We then present tools to efficiently solve related optimization problems on the torus of phase-only complex vectors: majorization-minimization and Riemannian optimization. We conclude by illustrating the merits of different options on a real-world case study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Non-Decimated Wavelet Packet Features and Transformer Models   for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08630v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article combines wavelet analysis techniques with machine learning methods for univariate time series forecasting, focusing on three main contributions. Firstly, we consider the use of Daubechies wavelets with different numbers of vanishing moments as input features to both non-temporal and temporal forecasting methods, by selecting these numbers during the cross-validation phase. Secondly, we compare the use of both the non-decimated wavelet transform and the non-decimated wavelet packet transform for computing these features, the latter providing a much larger set of potentially useful coefficient vectors. The wavelet coefficients are computed using a shifted version of the typical pyramidal algorithm to ensure no leakage of future information into these inputs. Thirdly, we evaluate the use of these wavelet features on a significantly wider set of forecasting methods than previous studies, including both temporal and non-temporal models, and both statistical and deep learning-based methods. The latter include state-of-the-art transformer-based neural network architectures. Our experiments suggest significant benefit in replacing higher-order lagged features with wavelet features across all examined non-temporal methods for one-step-forward forecasting, and modest benefit when used as inputs for temporal deep learning-based models for long-horizon forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Sleep Staging with Synthetic Time Series Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08592v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) time series can be challenging, especially with deep neural networks, due to the large variability among human subjects and often small datasets. To address these challenges, various strategies, such as self-supervised learning, have been suggested, but they typically rely on extensive empirical datasets. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we propose a pretraining task termed "frequency pretraining" to pretrain a neural network for sleep staging by predicting the frequency content of randomly generated synthetic time series. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses fully supervised learning in scenarios with limited data and few subjects, and matches its performance in regimes with many subjects. Furthermore, our results underline the relevance of frequency information for sleep stage scoring, while also demonstrating that deep neural networks utilize information beyond frequencies to enhance sleep staging performance, which is consistent with previous research. We anticipate that our approach will be advantageous across a broad spectrum of applications where EEG data is limited or derived from a small number of subjects, including the domain of brain-computer interfaces.</p></details> |
| **[Caformer: Rethinking Time Series Analysis from Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08572v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is a vital task with broad applications in various domains. However, effectively capturing cross-dimension and cross-time dependencies in non-stationary time series poses significant challenges, particularly in the context of environmental factors. The spurious correlation induced by the environment confounds the causal relationships between cross-dimension and cross-time dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Caformer (\underline{\textbf{Ca}}usal Trans\underline{\textbf{former}}) for time series analysis from a causal perspective. Specifically, our framework comprises three components: Dynamic Learner, Environment Learner, and Dependency Learner. The Dynamic Learner unveils dynamic interactions among dimensions, the Environment Learner mitigates spurious correlations caused by environment with a back-door adjustment, and the Dependency Learner aims to infer robust interactions across both time and dimensions. Our Caformer demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including long- and short-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection, with proper interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Ensembles for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06757v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of an increasing popularity of data-driven models to represent dynamical systems, many machine learning-based implementations of the Koopman operator have recently been proposed. However, the vast majority of those works are limited to deterministic predictions, while the knowledge of uncertainty is critical in fields like meteorology and climatology. In this work, we investigate the training of ensembles of models to produce stochastic outputs. We show through experiments on real remote sensing image time series that ensembles of independently trained models are highly overconfident and that using a training criterion that explicitly encourages the members to produce predictions with high inter-model variances greatly improves the uncertainty quantification of the ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Prediction Model for Rumor Forwarding Behavior Based on Uncertain Time   Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08493v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of rumors in social media is mainly caused by individual retweets. This paper applies uncertainty time series analysis (UTSA) to analyze a rumor retweeting behavior on Weibo. First, the rumor forwarding is modeled using uncertain time series, including order selection, parameter estimation, residual analysis, uncertainty hypothesis testing and forecast, and the validity of using uncertain time series analysis is further supported by analyzing the characteristics of the residual plot. The experimental results show that the uncertain time series can better predict the next stage of rumor forwarding. The results of the study have important practical significance for rumor management and the management of social media information dissemination.</p></details> |
| **[FSDR: A Novel Deep Learning-based Feature Selection Algorithm for Pseudo   Time-Series Data using Discrete Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08403v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional feature selection algorithms applied to Pseudo Time-Series (PTS) data, which consists of observations arranged in sequential order without adhering to a conventional temporal dimension, often exhibit impractical computational complexities with high dimensional data. To address this challenge, we introduce a Deep Learning (DL)-based feature selection algorithm: Feature Selection through Discrete Relaxation (FSDR), tailored for PTS data. Unlike the existing feature selection algorithms, FSDR learns the important features as model parameters using discrete relaxation, which refers to the process of approximating a discrete optimisation problem with a continuous one. FSDR is capable of accommodating a high number of feature dimensions, a capability beyond the reach of existing DL-based or traditional methods. Through testing on a hyperspectral dataset (i.e., a type of PTS data), our experimental results demonstrate that FSDR outperforms three commonly used feature selection algorithms, taking into account a balance among execution time, $R^2$, and $RMSE$.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeDRL: Disentangled Representation Learning for Multivariate   Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04142v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data in numerous real-world applications (e.g., healthcare and industry) are informative but challenging due to the lack of labels and high dimensionality. Recent studies in self-supervised learning have shown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on labels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing issues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these challenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series representation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings. TimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation of timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the former optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the latter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as transformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments on 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets have shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning approaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 58.02% in MSE and classification by 1.48% in accuracy. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies confirmed the relative contribution of each component in TimeDRL's architecture, and semi-supervised learning evaluations demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, even with limited labeled data. The code is available at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/TimeDRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the International Conference on Data   Engineering (ICDE) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Mean-Field Microcanonical Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08362v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microcanonical gradient descent is a sampling procedure for energy-based models allowing for efficient sampling of distributions in high dimension. It works by transporting samples from a high-entropy distribution, such as Gaussian white noise, to a low-energy region using gradient descent. We put this model in the framework of normalizing flows, showing how it can often overfit by losing an unnecessary amount of entropy in the descent. As a remedy, we propose a mean-field microcanonical gradient descent that samples several weakly coupled data points simultaneously, allowing for better control of the entropy loss while paying little in terms of likelihood fit. We study these models in the context of financial time series, illustrating the improvements on both synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSFool: Crafting Highly-Imperceptible Adversarial Time Series through   Multi-Objective Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06388v3)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of recurrent neural network (RNN) models in time series classification (TSC). However, neural networks (NNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which cause real-life adversarial attacks that undermine the robustness of AI models. To date, most existing attacks target at feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, but they cannot perform well on RNN-based TSC. This is due to the cyclical computation of RNN, which prevents direct model differentiation. In addition, the high visual sensitivity of time series to perturbations also poses challenges to local objective optimization of adversarial samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient method called TSFool to craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN-based TSC. The core idea is a new global optimization objective known as "Camouflage Coefficient" that captures the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the class distribution. Based on this, we reduce the adversarial attack problem to a multi-objective optimization problem that enhances the perturbation quality. Furthermore, to speed up the optimization process, we propose to use a representation model for RNN to capture deeply embedded vulnerable samples whose features deviate from the latent manifold. Experiments on 11 UCR and UEA datasets showcase that TSFool significantly outperforms six white-box and three black-box benchmark attacks in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and imperceptibility from various perspectives including standard measure, human study and real-world defense.</p></details> |
| **[Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular   Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14989v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2024, Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%).   https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Learning of Hybrid Latent Dynamics: A Learn-to-Identify   Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08194v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern applications increasingly require unsupervised learning of latent dynamics from high-dimensional time-series. This presents a significant challenge of identifiability: many abstract latent representations may reconstruct observations, yet do they guarantee an adequate identification of the governing dynamics? This paper investigates this challenge from two angles: the use of physics inductive bias specific to the data being modeled, and a learn-to-identify strategy that separates forecasting objectives from the data used for the identification. We combine these two strategies in a novel framework for unsupervised meta-learning of hybrid latent dynamics (Meta-HyLaD) with: 1) a latent dynamic function that hybridize known mathematical expressions of prior physics with neural functions describing its unknown errors, and 2) a meta-learning formulation to learn to separately identify both components of the hybrid dynamics. Through extensive experiments on five physics and one biomedical systems, we provide strong evidence for the benefits of Meta-HyLaD to integrate rich prior knowledge while identifying their gap to observed data.</p></details> |
| **[TILDE-Q: A Transformation Invariant Loss Function for Time-Series   Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15050v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has gained increasing attention in the field of artificial intelligence due to its potential to address real-world problems across various domains, including energy, weather, traffic, and economy. While time-series forecasting is a well-researched field, predicting complex temporal patterns such as sudden changes in sequential data still poses a challenge with current models. This difficulty stems from minimizing Lp norm distances as loss functions, such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean square error (MSE), which are susceptible to both intricate temporal dynamics modeling and signal shape capturing. Furthermore, these functions often cause models to behave aberrantly and generate uncorrelated results with the original time-series. Consequently, developing a shape-aware loss function that goes beyond mere point-wise comparison is essential. In this paper, we examine the definition of shape and distortions, which are crucial for shape-awareness in time-series forecasting, and provide a design rationale for the shape-aware loss function. Based on our design rationale, we propose a novel, compact loss function called TILDEQ (Transformation Invariant Loss function with Distance EQuilibrium) that considers not only amplitude and phase distortions but also allows models to capture the shape of time-series sequences. Furthermore, TILDE-Q supports the simultaneous modeling of periodic and nonperiodic temporal dynamics. We evaluate the efficacy of TILDE-Q by conducting extensive experiments under both periodic and nonperiodic conditions with various models ranging from naive to state-of-the-art. The experimental results show that the models trained with TILDE-Q surpass those trained with other metrics, such as MSE and DILATE, in various real-world applications, including electricity, traffic, illness, economics, weather, and electricity transformer temperature (ETT).</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages in total, 8 pages main paper, 3 pages references, and 6   pages appendix.

| **[Cyclical Long Memory: Decoupling, Modulation, and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07170v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new model for general cyclical long memory is introduced, by means of random modulation of certain bivariate long memory time series. This construction essentially decouples the two key features of cyclical long memory: quasi-periodicity and long-term persistence. It further allows for a general cyclical phase in cyclical long memory time series. Several choices for suitable bivariate long memory series are discussed, including a parametric fractionally integrated vector ARMA model. The parametric models introduced in this work have explicit autocovariance functions that can be used readily in simulation, estimation, and other tasks.</p></details> |
| **[Sparse dynamic network reconstruction through L1-regularization of a   Lyapunov equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05457v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important problem in many areas of science is that of recovering interaction networks from simultaneous time-series of many interacting dynamical processes. A common approach is to use the elements of the correlation matrix or its inverse as proxies of the interaction strengths, but the reconstructed networks are necessarily undirected. Transfer entropy methods have been proposed to reconstruct directed networks but the reconstructed network lacks information about interaction strengths. We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution. We further show how to use prior information on the (non)existence of a few directed edges to drastically improve the quality of the reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Causal Discovery Methods for I.I.D. and Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15027v4)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to understand causality from data is one of the major milestones of human-level intelligence. Causal Discovery (CD) algorithms can identify the cause-effect relationships among the variables of a system from related observational data with certain assumptions. Over the years, several methods have been developed primarily based on the statistical properties of data to uncover the underlying causal mechanism. In this study, we present an extensive discussion on the methods designed to perform causal discovery from both independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.) data and time series data. For this purpose, we first introduce the common terminologies used in causal discovery literature and then provide a comprehensive discussion of the algorithms designed to identify causal relations in different settings. We further discuss some of the benchmark datasets available for evaluating the algorithmic performance, off-the-shelf tools or software packages to perform causal discovery readily, and the common metrics used to evaluate these methods. We also evaluate some widely used causal discovery algorithms on multiple benchmark datasets and compare their performances. Finally, we conclude by discussing the research challenges and the applications of causal discovery algorithms in multiple areas of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published (05 Sept 2023) in Transactions on Machine Learning Research   (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Observation Time Window Segmentation for Administrative Data   Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16537v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models benefit when allowed to learn from temporal trends in time-stamped administrative data. These trends can be represented by dividing a model's observation window into time segments or bins. Model training time and performance can be improved by representing each feature with a different time resolution. However, this causes the time bin size hyperparameter search space to grow exponentially with the number of features. The contribution of this paper is to propose a computationally efficient time series analysis to investigate binning (TAIB) technique that determines which subset of data features benefit the most from time bin size hyperparameter tuning. This technique is demonstrated using hospital and housing/homelessness administrative data sets. The results show that TAIB leads to models that are not only more efficient to train but can perform better than models that default to representing all features with the same time bin size.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the use of supervised machine learning classification algorithms on simulated data based on a physical system with two states: Intact and Broken. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the preprocessing of temporal data, using measures of statistical dispersion and dimension reduction techniques. We present an intuitive baseline method and discuss its efficiency. We conclude with a comparison of the various methods based on different performance metrics, showing the advantage of using machine learning techniques as a tool in decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chronos: Learning the Language of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chronos, a simple yet effective framework for pretrained probabilistic time series models. Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infer...</summary><p>Inference code and model checkpoints available at   https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting</p></details> |

In this paper, we focus on high dimensional setting and seek for sample-size-efficient methodology to determine the level of cointegration. Our investigation centres at a Bayesian approach to analyse the cointegration matrix, henceforth determining the cointegration rank. We design two algorithms and implement them on simulated examples, yielding promising results particularly when dealing with high number of variables and relatively low number of observations. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to empirically investigate the constituents of the S&P 500 index, where low-volatility portfolios can be found during both in-sample training and out-of-sample testing periods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Spatiotemporal Prediction with Bayesian Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07657v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal datasets, which consist of spatially-referenced time series, are ubiquitous in many scientific and business-intelligence applications, such as air pollution monitoring, disease tracking, and cloud-demand forecasting. As modern datasets continue to increase in size and complexity, there is a growing need for new statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and scalable enough to handle large prediction problems. This work presents the Bayesian Neural Field (BayesNF), a domain-general statistical model for inferring rich probability distributions over a spatiotemporal domain, which can be used for data-analysis tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and variography. BayesNF integrates a novel deep neural network architecture for high-capacity function estimation with hierarchical Bayesian inference for robust uncertainty quantification. By defining the prior through a sequence of smooth differentiable transforms, posterior inference is conducted on large-scale data using variationally learned surrogates trained via stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate BayesNF against prominent statistical and machine-learning baselines, showing considerable improvements on diverse prediction problems from climate and public health datasets that contain tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements. The paper is accompanied with an open-source software package (https://github.com/google/bayesnf) that is easy-to-use and compatible with modern GPU and TPU accelerators on the JAX machine learning platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

These models rely primarily on utilizing ground motion records for tasks such as earthquake event classification, localization, earthquake early warning systems, and structural health monitoring. However, the extent to which these models effectively learn from these complex time-series signals has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. We perform a hyperparameter search on two deep learning models to assess their effectiveness in deep learning from ground motion records while also examining the impact of auxiliary information on model performance. Experimental results reveal a strong reliance on the highly correlated P and S phase arrival information. Our observations highlight a potential gap in the field, indicating an absence of robust methodologies for deep learning of single-station ground motion recordings independent of any auxiliary information.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 12 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image   Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical study of periodic autoregressive models with additive noise --   estimation and testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07070v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Periodic autoregressive (PAR) time series with finite variance is considered as one of the most common models of second-order cyclostationary processes. However, in the real applications, the signals with periodic characteristics may be disturbed by additional noise related to measurement device disturbances or to other external sources. Thus, the known estimation techniques dedicated for PAR models may be inefficient for such cases. When the variance of the additive noise is relatively small, it can be ignored and the classical estimation techniques can be applied. However, for extreme cases, the additive noise can have a significant influence on the estimation results. In this paper, we propose four estimation techniques for the noise-corrupted PAR models with finite variance distributions. The methodology is based on Yule-Walker equations utilizing the autocovariance function. It can be used for any type of the finite variance additive noise. The presented simulation study clearly indicates the efficiency of the proposed techniques, also for extreme case, when the additive noise is a sum of the Gaussian additive noise and additive outliers. The proposed estimation techniques are also applied for testing if the data corresponds to noise-corrupted PAR model. This issue is strongly related to the identification of informative component in the data in case when the model is disturbed by additive non-informative noise. The power of the test is studied for simulated data. Finally, the testing procedure is applied for two real time series describing particulate matter concentration in the air.</p></details> | <details><summary>Commu...</summary><p>Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation (2023)</p></details> |
| **[Taming Pre-trained LLMs for Generalised Time Series Forecasting via   Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting has recently gained great success with the rapid growth of deep learning models. However, existing approaches usually train models from scratch using limited temporal data, preventing their generalization. Recently, with the surge of the Large Language Models (LLMs), several works have attempted to introduce LLMs into time series forecasting. Despite promising results, these methods directly take time series as the input to LLMs, ignoring the inherent modality gap between temporal and text data. In this work, we propose a novel Large Language Models and time series alignment framework, dubbed LLaTA, to fully unleash the potentials of LLMs in the time series forecasting challenge. Based on cross-modal knowledge distillation, the proposed method exploits both input-agnostic static knowledge and input-dependent dynamic knowledge in pre-trained LLMs. In this way, it empowers the forecasting model with favorable performance as well as strong generalization abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method establishes a new state of the art for both long- and short-term forecasting.

| **[Dataset Condensation for Time Series Classification via Dual Domain   Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07245v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data has been demonstrated to be crucial in various research fields. The management of large quantities of time series data presents challenges in terms of deep learning tasks, particularly for training a deep neural network. Recently, a technique named \textit{Dataset Condensation} has emerged as a solution to this problem. This technique generates a smaller synthetic dataset that has comparable performance to the full real dataset in downstream tasks such as classification. However, previous methods are primarily designed for image and graph datasets, and directly adapting them to the time series dataset leads to suboptimal performance due to their inability to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in time series data, particularly in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dataset \textit{\textbf{Cond}}ensation for \textit{\textbf{T}}ime \textit{\textbf{S}}eries \textit{\textbf{C}}lassification via Dual Domain Matching (\textbf{CondTSC}) which focuses on the time series classification dataset condensation task. Different from previous methods, our proposed framework aims to generate a condensed dataset that matches the surrogate objectives in both the time and frequency domains. Specifically, CondTSC incorporates multi-view data augmentation, dual domain training, and dual surrogate objectives to enhance the dataset condensation process in the time and frequency domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms other baselines and learns a condensed synthetic dataset that exhibits desirable characteristics such as conforming to the distribution of the original data.</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Gap between TD Learning and Supervised Learning -- A   Generalisation Point of View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11237v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can stitch pieces of experience to solve a task never seen before during training. This oft-sought property is one of the few ways in which RL methods based on dynamic-programming differ from RL methods based on supervised-learning (SL). Yet, certain RL methods based on off-the-shelf SL algorithms achieve excellent results without an explicit mechanism for stitching; it remains unclear whether those methods forgo this important stitching property. This paper studies this question for the problems of achieving a target goal state and achieving a target return value. Our main result is to show that the stitching property corresponds to a form of combinatorial generalization: after training on a distribution of (state, goal) pairs, one would like to evaluate on (state, goal) pairs not seen together in the training data. Our analysis shows that this sort of generalization is different from i.i.d. generalization. This connection between stitching and generalisation reveals why we should not expect SL-based RL methods to perform stitching, even in the limit of large datasets and models. Based on this analysis, we construct new datasets to explicitly test for this property, revealing that SL-based methods lack this stitching property and hence fail to perform combinatorial generalization. Nonetheless, the connection between stitching and combinatorial generalisation also suggests a simple remedy for improving generalisation in SL: data augmentation. We propose a temporal data augmentation and demonstrate that adding it to SL-based methods enables them to successfully complete tasks not seen together during training. On a high level, this connection illustrates the importance of combinatorial generalization for data efficiency in time-series data beyond tasks beyond RL, like audio, video, or text.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024, Project code:   https://github.com/RajGhugare19/stitching-is-combinatorial-generalisation</p></details> |
| **[Sample Splitting and Assessing Goodness-of-fit of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07158v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental and often final step in time series modeling is to assess the quality of fit of a proposed model to the data. Since the underlying distribution of the innovations that generate a model is often not prescribed, goodness-of-fit tests typically take the form of testing the fitted residuals for serial independence. However, these fitted residuals are inherently dependent since they are based on the same parameter estimates and thus standard tests of serial independence, such as those based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) or distance correlation function (ADCF) of the fitted residuals need to be adjusted. The sample splitting procedure in Pfister et al.~(2018) is one such fix for the case of models for independent data, but fails to work in the dependent setting. In this paper sample splitting is leveraged in the time series setting to perform tests of serial dependence of fitted residuals using the ACF and ADCF. Here the first $f_n$ of the data points are used to estimate the parameters of the model and then using these parameter estimates, the last $l_n$ of the data points are used to compute the estimated residuals. Tests for serial independence are then based on these $l_n$ residuals. As long as the overlap between the $f_n$ and $l_n$ data splits is asymptotically 1/2, the ACF and ADCF tests of serial independence tests often have the same limit distributions as though the underlying residuals are indeed iid. In particular if the first half of the data is used to estimate the parameters and the estimated residuals are computed for the entire data set based on these parameter estimates, then the ACF and ADCF can have the same limit distributions as though the residuals were iid. This procedure ameliorates the need for adjustment in the construction of confidence bounds for both the ACF and ADCF in goodness-of-fit testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Traditional top-down approaches often struggle to capture critical signals in rapidly changing events. As global events evolve swiftly, social media narratives, including instances of disinformation, become significant sources of insights. To address the need for an inductive strategy, we explore a niche social media platform GAB and an established messaging service Telegram, to develop methodologies applicable on a broader scale. This study investigates narrative evolution on these platforms using quantitative corpus-based discourse analysis techniques. Our approach is a novel mode to study multiple social media domains to distil key information which may be obscured otherwise, allowing for useful and actionable insights. The paper details the technical and methodological aspects of gathering and preprocessing GAB and Telegram data for a keyness (Log Ratio) metric analysis, identifying crucial nouns and verbs for deeper exploration. Empirically, this approach is applied to a case study of a well defined event that had global impact: the 2023 Wagner mutiny. The main findings are: (1) the time line can be deconstructed to provide useful data features allowing for improved interpretation; (2) a methodology is applied which provides a basis for generalization. The key contribution is an approach, that in some cases, provides the ability to capture the dynamic narrative shifts over time with elevated confidence. The approach can augment near-real-time assessment of key social movements, allowing for informed governance choices. This research is important because it lays out a useful methodology for time series relevant info-culling, which can enable proactive modes for positive social engagement.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI2024 Workshop on AI for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS)</p></details> |
| **[Grid Monitoring and Protection with Continuous Point-on-Wave   Measurements and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose This article presents a case for a next-generation grid monitoring and control system, leveraging recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and statistical inference. Advancing beyond earlier generations of wide-area monitoring systems built upon supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and synchrophasor technologies, we argue for a monitoring and control framework based on the streaming of continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) measurements with AI-powered data compression and fault detection.   Methods and Results: The architecture of the proposed design originates from the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of a random process that transforms causally a stationary random process into an innovation sequence with independent and identically distributed random variables. This work presents a generative AI approach that (i) learns an innovation autoencoder that extracts innovation sequence from CPOW time series, (ii) compresses the CPOW streaming data with innovation autoencoder and subband coding, and (iii) detects unknown faults and novel trends via nonparametric sequential hypothesis testing.   Conclusion: This work argues that conventional monitoring using SCADA and phasor measurement unit (PMU) technologies is ill-suited for a future grid with deep penetration of inverter-based renewable generations and distributed energy resources. A monitoring system based on CPOW data streaming and AI data analytics should be the basic building blocks for situational awareness of a highly dynamic future grid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Tuning Parameter Selection for High-Dimensional Vector   Autoregressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06657v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lasso-type estimators are routinely used to estimate high-dimensional time series models. The theoretical guarantees established for Lasso typically require the penalty level to be chosen in a suitable fashion often depending on unknown population quantities. Furthermore, the resulting estimates and the number of variables retained in the model depend crucially on the chosen penalty level. However, there is currently no theoretically founded guidance for this choice in the context of high-dimensional time series. Instead one resorts to selecting the penalty level in an ad hoc manner using, e.g., information criteria or cross-validation. We resolve this problem by considering estimation of the perhaps most commonly employed multivariate time series model, the linear vector autoregressive (VAR) model, and propose a weighted Lasso estimator with penalization chosen in a fully data-driven way. The theoretical guarantees that we establish for the resulting estimation and prediction error match those currently available for methods based on infeasible choices of penalization. We thus provide a first solution for choosing the penalization in high-dimensional time series models.</p></details> |

While the Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) serves as the standard metric for evaluating generative models in image synthesis, a comparable metric for time series data is notably absent. This gap in assessment capabilities stems from the absence of a widely accepted feature vector extractor pre-trained on benchmark time series datasets. In addressing these challenges related to assessing the quality of time series, particularly in the context of Fr\'echet Distance, this work proposes a novel solution leveraging the Fourier transform and Auto-encoder, termed the Fr\'{e}chet Fourier-transform Auto-encoder Distance (FFAD). Through our experimental results, we showcase the potential of FFAD for effectively distinguishing samples from different classes. This novel metric emerges as a fundamental tool for the evaluation of generative time series data, contributing to the ongoing efforts of enhancing assessment methodologies in the realm of deep learning-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ICTIS-2024 on March 8th, 2024</p></details> |

This study uses a novel bandpass bootstrap approach called the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) to investigate the periodically correlated (PC) components including seasonality within US COVID-19 mortality. Bootstrapping to produce confidence intervals (CI) for periodic characteristics such as the seasonal mean requires preservation of the PC component's correlation structure during resampling. While existing bootstrap methods can preserve the PC component correlation structure, filtration of that PC component's frequency from interference is critical to bootstrap the PC component's characteristics accurately and efficiently. The VBPBB filters the PC time series to reduce interference from other components such as noise. This greatly reduces bootstrapped CI size and outperforms the statistical power and accuracy of other methods when estimating the periodic mean sampling distribution. VBPBB analysis of US COVID-19 mortality PC components are provided and compared against alternative bootstrapping methods. These results reveal crucial evidence supporting the presence of a seasonal PC pattern and existence of additional PC components, their timing, and CIs for their effect which will aid prediction and preparation for future COVID-19 responses.</p></details> |

We examine two related, complementary inference tasks: the detection of anomalous graphs within a time series, and the detection of temporally anomalous vertices. We approach these tasks via the adaptation of statistically principled methods for joint graph inference, specifically \emph{multiple adjacency spectral embedding} (MASE). We demonstrate that our method is effective for our inference tasks. Moreover, we assess the performance of our method in terms of the underlying nature of detectable anomalies. We further provide the theoretical justification for our method and insight into its use. Applied to the Enron communication graph and a large-scale commercial search engine time series of graphs, our approaches demonstrate their applicability and identify the anomalous vertices beyond just large degree change.</p></details> |
| **[Estimation of Grouped Time-Varying Network Vector Autoregression Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10117v2)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a flexible time-varying network vector autoregressive model framework for large-scale time series. A latent group structure is imposed on the heterogeneous and node-specific time-varying momentum and network spillover effects so that the number of unknown time-varying coefficients to be estimated can be reduced considerably. A classic agglomerative clustering algorithm with nonparametrically estimated distance matrix is combined with a ratio criterion to consistently estimate the latent group number and membership. A post-grouping local linear smoothing method is proposed to estimate the group-specific time-varying momentum and network effects, substantially improving the convergence rates of the preliminary estimates which ignore the latent structure. We further modify the methodology and theory to allow for structural breaks in either the group membership, group number or group-specific coefficient functions. Numerical studies including Monte-Carlo simulation and an empirical application are presented to examine the finite-sample performance of the developed model and methodology.</p></details> |  |

Central to our approach is that we reconceive time-series forecasting as a self-supervised, multi-patch prediction task, which, compared to traditional contrastive learning or mask-and-reconstruction methods, captures temporal dynamics in patch representations more effectively. Our strategy encompasses two-stage training: (i). a causal continual pre-training phase on various time-series datasets, anchored on next patch prediction, effectively syncing LLM capabilities with the intricacies of time-series data; (ii). fine-tuning for multi-patch prediction in the targeted time-series context. A distinctive element of our framework is the patch-wise decoding layer, which departs from previous methods reliant on sequence-level decoding. Such a design directly transposes individual patches into temporal sequences, thereby significantly bolstering the model's proficiency in mastering temporal patch-based representations. aLLM4TS demonstrates superior performance in several downstream tasks, proving its effectiveness in deriving temporal representations with enhanced transferability and marking a pivotal advancement in the adaptation of LLMs for time-series analysis.</p></details> |  |

Our modelling approach is multimodal, based on two-dimensional spectrogram representations derived from numerous EEG channels, alongside the integration of clinical data and features extracted directly from EEG recordings. Our submitted model achieved a Challenge score of $0.53$ on the hidden test set for predictions made $72$ hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Our study shows the efficacy and limitations of employing transfer learning in medical classification. With regard to prospective implementation, our analysis reveals that the performance of the model is strongly linked to the selection of a decision threshold and exhibits strong variability across data splits.</p></details> |

Applying a central and functional central limit result for Hilbert-valued martingale difference sequences, the asymptotic behavior of the formulated H-valued empirical process, also indexed by H, is obtained under the null hypothesis. The limiting process is H-valued generalized (i.e., indexed by H) Wiener process, leading to an asymptotically distribution free test. Consistency of the test is also proved. The case of misspecified autocorrelation operator of the ARH(1) process is addressed. The asymptotic equivalence in probability, uniformly in the norm of H, of the empirical processes formulated under known and unknown autocorrelation operator is obtained. Beyond the Euclidean setting, this approach allows to implement goodness of fit testing in the context of manifold and spherical functional autoregressive processes.</p></details> |  |

However, the semantic space of LLMs, established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning with LLM ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embeddings space and perform time series forecasting based on learned prompts from the joint space. We first design a tokenization module tailored for cross-modality alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as prompts to provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations verify the necessity of prompt learning informed by semantic space.</p></details> |  |

However, the effective utilization of their strong modeling ability in the probabilistic time series forecasting task remains an open question, partially due to the challenge of instability arising from their stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion (MG-TSD) model, which achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance by leveraging the inherent granularity levels within the data as given targets at intermediate diffusion steps to guide the learning process of diffusion models. The way to construct the targets is motivated by the observation that the forward process of the diffusion model, which sequentially corrupts the data distribution to a standard normal distribution, intuitively aligns with the process of smoothing fine-grained data into a coarse-grained representation, both of which result in a gradual loss of fine distribution features. In the study, we derive a novel multi-granularity guidance diffusion loss function and propose a concise implementation method to effectively utilize coarse-grained data across various granularity levels. More importantly, our approach does not rely on additional external data, making it versatile and applicable across various domains. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our MG-TSD model outperforms existing time series prediction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |

Under the paradigm of generative artificial intelligence, the proposed forecasting architecture includes an autoencoder that transforms nonparametric multivariate random processes into canonical innovation sequences, from which future time series samples are generated according to their probability distributions conditioned on past samples. A novel deep-learning algorithm is proposed that constrains the latent process to be an independent and identically distributed sequence with matching autoencoder input-output conditional probability distributions. Asymptotic optimality and structural convergence properties of the proposed generative forecasting approach are established. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for merchant storage participants, {(ii) interregional price spread forecasting for interchange markets,} and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate superior performance against leading traditional and machine learning-based forecasting techniques under both probabilistic and point forecast metrics.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fast, effective, and coherent time series modeling using the   sparsity-ranked lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01492v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparsity-ranked lasso (SRL) has been developed for model selection and estimation in the presence of interactions and polynomials. The main tenet of the SRL is that an algorithm should be more skeptical of higher-order polynomials and interactions *a priori* compared to main effects, and hence the inclusion of these more complex terms should require a higher level of evidence. In time series, the same idea of ranked prior skepticism can be applied to the possibly seasonal autoregressive (AR) structure of the series during the model fitting process, becoming especially useful in settings with uncertain or multiple modes of seasonality. The SRL can naturally incorporate exogenous variables, with streamlined options for inference and/or feature selection. The fitting process is quick even for large series with a high-dimensional feature set. In this work, we discuss both the formulation of this procedure and the software we have developed for its implementation via the **fastTS** R package. We explore the performance of our SRL-based approach in a novel application involving the autoregressive modeling of hourly emergency room arrivals at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. We find that the SRL is considerably faster than its competitors, while producing more accurate predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Stati...</summary><p>Statistical Modelling. 2024</p></details> |
| **[Considering Nonstationary within Multivariate Time Series with   Variational Hierarchical Transformer for Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05406v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) has long been an important but challenging task. Due to the non-stationary problem across long-distance time steps, previous studies primarily adopt stationarization method to attenuate the non-stationary problem of the original series for better predictability. However, existing methods always adopt the stationarized series, which ignores the inherent non-stationarity, and has difficulty in modeling MTS with complex distributions due to the lack of stochasticity. To tackle these problems, we first develop a powerful hierarchical probabilistic generative module to consider the non-stationarity and stochastic characteristics within MTS, and then combine it with transformer for a well-defined variational generative dynamic model named Hierarchical Time series Variational Transformer (HTV-Trans), which recovers the intrinsic non-stationary information into temporal dependencies. Being a powerful probabilistic model, HTV-Trans is utilized to learn expressive representations of MTS and applied to forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the efficiency of HTV-Trans on MTS forecasting tasks</p></details> |
| **[Human Observation-Inspired Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving   in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04318v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), trajectory prediction remains a formidable challenge, especially in mixed autonomy environments. Traditional approaches often rely on computational methods such as time-series analysis. Our research diverges significantly by adopting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates principles of human cognition and observational behavior into trajectory prediction models for AVs. We introduce a novel "adaptive visual sector" mechanism that mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. Additionally, we develop a "dynamic traffic graph" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture spatio-temporal dependencies among agents. Benchmark tests on the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets reveal that our model (GAVA) outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 15.2%, 19.4%, and 12.0%, respectively. Our findings underscore the potential of leveraging human cognition principles to enhance the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction algorithms in AVs. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Enhancing Time Series Contrastive Learning: A Dynamic Bad Pair   Mining Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03357v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Not all positive pairs are beneficial to time series contrastive learning. In this paper, we study two types of bad positive pairs that can impair the quality of time series representation learned through contrastive learning: the noisy positive pair and the faulty positive pair. We observe that, with the presence of noisy positive pairs, the model tends to simply learn the pattern of noise (Noisy Alignment). Meanwhile, when faulty positive pairs arise, the model wastes considerable amount of effort aligning non-representative patterns (Faulty Alignment). To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Bad Pair Mining (DBPM) algorithm, which reliably identifies and suppresses bad positive pairs in time series contrastive learning. Specifically, DBPM utilizes a memory module to dynamically track the training behavior of each positive pair along training process. This allows us to identify potential bad positive pairs at each epoch based on their historical training behaviors. The identified bad pairs are subsequently down-weighted through a transformation module, thereby mitigating their negative impact on the representation learning process. DBPM is a simple algorithm designed as a lightweight plug-in without learnable parameters to enhance the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods. Through extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, real-world time series datasets, we demonstrate DBPM's efficacy in mitigating the adverse effects of bad positive pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

While MTS are a valuable tool for clinical prediction, their fusion with other data modalities can possibly result in more thorough insights and more accurate results. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as fundamental tools for identifying and defining underlying patterns in the healthcare domain. However, fundamental improvements in interpretability are needed for DNN models to be widely used in the clinical setting. In this study, we present an approach built on a collection of interpretable multimodal data-driven models that may anticipate and understand the emergence of antimicrobial multidrug resistance (AMR) germs in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada (Madrid, Spain). The profile and initial health status of the patient are modeled using static variables, while the evolution of the patient's health status during the ICU stay is modeled using several MTS, including mechanical ventilation and antibiotics intake. The multimodal DNNs models proposed in this paper include interpretable principles in addition to being effective at predicting AMR and providing an explainable prediction support system for AMR in the ICU. Furthermore, our proposed methodology based on multimodal models and interpretability schemes can be leveraged in additional clinical problems dealing with EHR data, broadening the impact and applicability of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Comparison for Fast Domain Adaptation in Table Service Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05092v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In restaurants, many aspects of customer service, such as greeting customers, taking orders, and processing payments, are automated. Due to the various cuisines, required services, and different standards of each restaurant, one challenging part of making the entire automated process is inspecting and providing appropriate services at the table during a meal. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach for automatically checking and providing services at the table. We initially construct a base model to recognize common information to comprehend the context of the table, such as object category, remaining food quantity, and meal progress status. After that, we add a service recognition classifier and retrain the model using a small amount of local restaurant data. We gathered data capturing the restaurant table during the meal in order to find a suitable service recognition classifier. With different inputs, combinations, time series, and data choices, we carried out a variety of tests. Through these tests, we discovered that the model with few significant data points and trainable parameters is more crucial in the case of sparse and redundant retraining data.</p></details> |

This is at the price of a high storage space and a slow speed in the inference (test) time. To address this issue, we propose Density-Regression, a method that leverages the density function in uncertainty estimation and achieves fast inference by a single forward pass. We prove it is distance aware on the feature space, which is a necessary condition for a neural network to produce high-quality uncertainty estimation under distribution shifts. Empirically, we conduct experiments on regression tasks with the cubic toy dataset, benchmark UCI, weather forecast with time series, and depth estimation under real-world shifted applications. We show that Density-Regression has competitive uncertainty estimation performance under distribution shifts with modern deep regressors while using a lower model size and a faster inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,   2024</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series by Latent Process   Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04915v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data arising in many applications nowadays are high-dimensional. A large number of parameters describe features of these time series. We propose a novel approach to modeling a high-dimensional time series through several independent univariate time series, which are then orthogonally rotated and sparsely linearly transformed. With this approach, any specified intrinsic relations among component time series given by a graphical structure can be maintained at all time snapshots. We call the resulting process an Orthogonally-rotated Univariate Time series (OUT). Key structural properties of time series such as stationarity and causality can be easily accommodated in the OUT model. For Bayesian inference, we put suitable prior distributions on the spectral densities of the independent latent times series, the orthogonal rotation matrix, and the common precision matrix of the component times series at every time point. A likelihood is constructed using the Whittle approximation for univariate latent time series. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for posterior computation. We study the convergence of the pseudo-posterior distribution based on the Whittle likelihood for the model's parameters upon developing a new general posterior convergence theorem for pseudo-posteriors. We find that the posterior contraction rate for independent observations essentially prevails in the OUT model under very mild conditions on the temporal dependence described in terms of the smoothness of the corresponding spectral densities. Through a simulation study, we compare the accuracy of estimating the parameters and identifying the graphical structure with other approaches. We apply the proposed methodology to analyze a dataset on different industrial components of the US gross domestic product between 2010 and 2019 and predict future observations.</p></details> |  |

Vibration sensors are an important facet of both human and robotic tactile sensing, providing fast detection of contact and onset of slip. Microphones are an attractive option for implementing vibration sensing as they offer a fast response and can be sampled quickly, are affordable, and occupy a very small footprint. Our prototype sensor uses only a sparse array (8-9 mm spacing) of distributed MEMS microphones (<$1, 3.76 x 2.95 x 1.10 mm) embedded under an elastomer. We use transformer-based architectures for data analysis, taking advantage of the microphones' high sampling rate to run our models on time-series data as opposed to individual snapshots. This approach allows us to obtain 77.3% average accuracy on 4-class texture classification (84.2% when excluding the slowest drag velocity), 1.8 mm mean error on contact localization, and 5.6 mm/s mean error on contact velocity. We show that the learned texture and localization models are robust to varying velocity and generalize to unseen velocities. We also report that our sensor provides fast contact detection, an important advantage of fast transducers. This investigation illustrates the capabilities one can achieve with a MEMS microphone array alone, leaving valuable sensor real estate available for integration with complementary tactile sensing modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on   Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Time Series Classification via Attention   Kronecker Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04882v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high-resolution time series classification problem is essential due to the increasing availability of detailed temporal data in various domains. To tackle this challenge effectively, it is imperative that the state-of-the-art attention model is scalable to accommodate the growing sequence lengths typically encountered in high-resolution time series data, while also demonstrating robustness in handling the inherent noise prevalent in such datasets. To address this, we propose to hierarchically encode the long time series into multiple levels based on the interaction ranges. By capturing relationships at different levels, we can build more robust, expressive, and efficient models that are capable of capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in the data. We then propose a new time series transformer backbone (KronTime) by introducing Kronecker-decomposed attention to process such multi-level time series, which sequentially calculates attention from the lower level to the upper level. Experiments on four long time series datasets demonstrate superior classification results with improved efficiency compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modular End-to-End Multimodal Learning Method for Structured and   Unstructured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04866v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning is a rapidly growing research field that has revolutionized multitasking and generative modeling in AI. While much of the research has focused on dealing with unstructured data (e.g., language, images, audio, or video), structured data (e.g., tabular data, time series, or signals) has received less attention. However, many industry-relevant use cases involve or can be benefited from both types of data. In this work, we propose a modular, end-to-end multimodal learning method called MAGNUM, which can natively handle both structured and unstructured data. MAGNUM is flexible enough to employ any specialized unimodal module to extract, compress, and fuse information from all available modalities.</p></details> |

This approach focuses on the automatic analysis of the time series generated from the interaction of the children with mobile devices. In particular, we extract a set of 25 time series related to spatial, pressure, and kinematic information of the children interaction while colouring a tree through a pen stylus tablet, a specific test from the large-scale public ChildCIdb database.   A complete analysis of the proposed approach is carried out using different time series selection techniques to choose the most discriminative ones for the age group detection task: i) a statistical analysis, and ii) an automatic algorithm called Sequential Forward Search (SFS). In addition, different classification algorithms such as Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are studied. Accuracy results over 85% are achieved, outperforming previous approaches in the literature and in more challenging age group conditions. Finally, the approach presented in this study can benefit many children-related applications, for example, towards an age-appropriate environment with the technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, 32 references</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal learning for geospatial vegetation forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16198v2)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The innovative application of precise geospatial vegetation forecasting holds immense potential across diverse sectors, including agriculture, forestry, humanitarian aid, and carbon accounting. To leverage the vast availability of satellite imagery for this task, various works have applied deep neural networks for predicting multispectral images in photorealistic quality. However, the important area of vegetation dynamics has not been thoroughly explored. Our study breaks new ground by introducing GreenEarthNet, the first dataset specifically designed for high-resolution vegetation forecasting, and Contextformer, a novel deep learning approach for predicting vegetation greenness from Sentinel 2 satellite images with fine resolution across Europe. Our multi-modal transformer model Contextformer leverages spatial context through a vision backbone and predicts the temporal dynamics on local context patches incorporating meteorological time series in a parameter-efficient manner. The GreenEarthNet dataset features a learned cloud mask and an appropriate evaluation scheme for vegetation modeling. It also maintains compatibility with the existing satellite imagery forecasting dataset EarthNet2021, enabling cross-dataset model comparisons. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that our methods outperform a broad range of baseline techniques. This includes surpassing previous state-of-the-art models on EarthNet2021, as well as adapted models from time series forecasting and video prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first models for continental-scale vegetation modeling at fine resolution able to capture anomalies beyond the seasonal cycle, thereby paving the way for predicting vegetation health and behaviour in response to climate variability and extremes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024.

| **[Top-k contrast order-preserving pattern mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02612v2)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, order-preserving pattern (OPP) mining, a new sequential pattern mining method, has been proposed to mine frequent relative orders in a time series. Although frequent relative orders can be used as features to classify a time series, the mined patterns do not reflect the differences between two classes of time series well. To effectively discover the differences between time series, this paper addresses the top-k contrast OPP (COPP) mining and proposes a COPP-Miner algorithm to discover the top-k contrast patterns as features for time series classification, avoiding the problem of improper parameter setting. COPP-Miner is composed of three parts: extreme point extraction to reduce the length of the original time series, forward mining, and reverse mining to discover COPPs. Forward mining contains three steps: group pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns, the support rate calculation method to efficiently calculate the support of a pattern, and two pruning strategies to further prune candidate patterns. Reverse mining uses one pruning strategy to prune candidate patterns and consists of applying the same process as forward mining. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and show that top-k COPPs can be used as features to obtain a better classification performance.</p></details> |  |

The study involves a comprehensive evaluation across three different datasets: MSL, SMAP, and SWaT. Each dataset poses unique challenges, allowing for a robust assessment of the models' capabilities in varied contexts. The dimensionality reduction techniques examined include PCA, UMAP, Random Projection, and t-SNE, each offering distinct advantages in simplifying high-dimensional data. Our findings reveal that dimensionality reduction not only aids in reducing computational complexity but also significantly enhances anomaly detection performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, a remarkable reduction in training times was observed, with reductions by approximately 300\% and 650\% when dimensionality was halved and minimized to the lowest dimensions, respectively. This efficiency gain underscores the dual benefit of dimensionality reduction in both performance enhancement and operational efficiency. The MUTANT model exhibits notable adaptability, especially with UMAP reduction, while the Anomaly-Transformer demonstrates versatility across various reduction techniques. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the synergistic effects of dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection, contributing valuable perspectives to the field of time series analysis. The study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate dimensionality reduction strategies based on specific model requirements and dataset characteristics, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Machine Learning</p></details> |

However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, characterized by numerous variables and lengthy temporal sequences, poses challenges, including increased noise and extended model runtime. This paper focuses on reducing redundant information to elevate forecasting accuracy while optimizing runtime efficiency. We propose a novel transformer forecasting framework enhanced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to tackle this challenge. The framework is evaluated by five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and four diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the framework's ability to minimize prediction errors across all models and datasets while significantly reducing runtime. From the model perspective, one of the PCA-enhanced models: PCA+Crossformer, reduces mean square errors (MSE) by 33.3% and decreases runtime by 49.2% on average. From the dataset perspective, the framework delivers 14.3% MSE and 76.6% runtime reduction on Electricity datasets, as well as 4.8% MSE and 86.9% runtime reduction on Traffic datasets. This study aims to advance various SOTA models and enhance transformer-based time series forecasting for intricate data.

Distinctive trend characteristics in each time series pose challenges, and existing methods, relying on basic moving average kernels, may struggle with the non-linear structure and complex trends in real-world data. Given that, we introduce a learnable decomposition strategy to capture dynamic trend information more reasonably. Additionally, we propose a dual attention module tailored to capture inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations simultaneously for better time series forecasting, which is implemented by channel-wise self-attention and autoregressive self-attention. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across eight open-source datasets and compared it with the state-of-the-art methods. Through the comparison results, our Leddam (LEarnable Decomposition and Dual Attention Module) not only demonstrates significant advancements in predictive performance, but also the proposed decomposition strategy can be plugged into other methods with a large performance-boosting, from 11.87% to 48.56% MSE error degradation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel theoretical perspective where the recursive equation that defines simple exponential smoothing occurs naturally as a stochastic gradient ascent scheme to optimize a sequence of Gaussian log-likelihood functions. Under this lens of analysis, our main theorem shows that -- in a general setting -- simple exponential smoothing converges to a neighborhood of the trend of a trend-stationary stochastic process. This offers a novel theoretical assurance that the exponential smoothing procedure yields reliable estimators of the underlying trend shedding light on long-standing observations in the literature regarding the robustness of simple exponential smoothing.</p></details> |

| **[MKF-ADS: A Multi-Knowledge Fused Anomaly Detection System for Automotive](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04293v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the requirements of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) for extensive connectivity of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to the outside world, safety and security have become stringent problems. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are a crucial safety component in remediating Controller Area Network (CAN) bus vulnerabilities. However, supervised-based IDSs fail to identify complexity attacks and anomaly-based IDSs have higher false alarms owing to capability bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-knowledge fused anomaly detection model, called MKF-IDS. Specifically, the method designs an integration framework, including spatial-temporal correlation with an attention mechanism (STcAM) module and patch sparse-transformer module (PatchST). The STcAM with fine-pruning uses one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) to extract spatial features and subsequently utilizes the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract the temporal features, where the attention mechanism will focus on the important time steps. Meanwhile, the PatchST captures the combined long-time historical features from independent univariate time series. Finally, the proposed method is based on knowledge distillation to STcAM as a student model for learning intrinsic knowledge and cross the ability to mimic PatchST. In the detection phase, the MKF-ADS only deploys STcAM to maintain efficiency in a resource-limited IVN environment. Moreover, the redundant noisy signal is reduced with bit flip rate and boundary decision estimation. We conduct extensive experiments on six simulation attack scenarios across various CAN IDs and time steps, and two real attack scenarios, which present a competitive prediction and detection performance. Compared with the baseline in the same paradigm, the error rate and FAR are 2.62% and 2.41% and achieve a promising F1-score of 97.3%.</p></details> |

In this scenario, where data non-stationarity is pronounced, successful forecasting heavily relies on identifying and leveraging similar historical data rather than merely summarizing periodic patterns. Existing models based on RNN or Transformer architectures often struggle with this flexible and effective utilization. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient and adaptable cross-attention module termed RACA, which effectively leverages historical segments in forecasting task, and we devised a precise representation scheme for querying historical sequences, coupled with the design of a knowledge repository. These critical components collectively form our Retrieval-Augmented Temporal Sequence Forecasting framework (RATSF). RATSF not only significantly enhances performance in the context of Fliggy hotel service volume forecasting but, more crucially, can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based time-series forecasting models across various application scenarios.

| **[Super-resolution on network telemetry time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04165v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained monitoring is crucial for multiple data-driven tasks such as debugging, provisioning, and securing networks. Yet, practical constraints in collecting, extracting, and storing data often force operators to use coarse-grained sampled monitoring, degrading the performance of the various tasks. In this work, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the correlations among coarse-grained time series to impute their fine-grained counterparts in software. We present Zoom2Net, a transformer-based model for network imputation that incorporates domain knowledge through operational and measurement constraints, ensuring that the imputed network telemetry time series are not only realistic but also align with existing measurements and are plausible. This approach enhances the capabilities of current monitoring infrastructures, allowing operators to gain more insights into system behaviors without the need for hardware upgrades. We evaluate Zoom2Net on four diverse datasets (e.g. cloud telemetry and Internet data transfer) and use cases (such as bursts analysis and traffic classification). We demonstrate that Zoom2Net consistently achieves high imputation accuracy with a zoom-in factor of up to 100 and performs better on downstream tasks compared to baselines by an average of 38%.</p></details> |  |

We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios. The code is made available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/pathformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 12th International Conference on Learning   Representations (ICLR 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Inference via Interpolation: Contrastive Representations Provably Enable   Planning and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04082v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given time series data, how can we answer questions like "what will happen in the future?" and "how did we get here?" These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/vivekmyers/contrastive_planning</p></details> |
| **[Feel the Bite: Robot-Assisted Inside-Mouth Bite Transfer using Robust   Mouth Perception and Physical Interaction-Aware Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04067v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted feeding can greatly enhance the lives of those with mobility limitations. Modern feeding systems can pick up and position food in front of a care recipient's mouth for a bite. However, many with severe mobility constraints cannot lean forward and need direct inside-mouth food placement. This demands precision, especially for those with restricted mouth openings, and appropriately reacting to various physical interactions - incidental contacts as the utensil moves inside, impulsive contacts due to sudden muscle spasms, deliberate tongue maneuvers by the person being fed to guide the utensil, and intentional bites. In this paper, we propose an inside-mouth bite transfer system that addresses these challenges with two key components: a multi-view mouth perception pipeline robust to tool occlusion, and a control mechanism that employs multimodal time-series classification to discern and react to different physical interactions. We demonstrate the efficacy of these individual components through two ablation studies. In a full system evaluation, our system successfully fed 13 care recipients with diverse mobility challenges. Participants consistently emphasized the comfort and safety of our inside-mouth bite transfer system, and gave it high technology acceptance ratings - underscoring its transformative potential in real-world scenarios.

| **[Temporal Cross-Attention for Dynamic Embedding and Tokenization of   Multimodal Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04012v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The breadth, scale, and temporal granularity of modern electronic health records (EHR) systems offers great potential for estimating personalized and contextual patient health trajectories using sequential deep learning. However, learning useful representations of EHR data is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, multimodality, irregular and variable-specific recording frequency, and timestamp duplication when multiple measurements are recorded simultaneously. Although recent efforts to fuse structured EHR and unstructured clinical notes suggest the potential for more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes, less focus has been placed on EHR embedding approaches that directly address temporal EHR challenges by learning time-aware representations from multimodal patient time series. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic embedding and tokenization framework for precise representation of multimodal clinical time series that combines novel methods for encoding time and sequential position with temporal cross-attention. Our embedding and tokenization framework, when integrated into a multitask transformer classifier with sliding window attention, outperformed baseline approaches on the exemplar task of predicting the occurrence of nine postoperative complications of more than 120,000 major inpatient surgeries using multimodal data from three hospitals and two academic health centers in the United States.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Workshop on Learning From Time Series for Health. 10 pages,   3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Electrical Load Forecasting Model Using Hybrid LSTM Neural Networks with   Online Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03898v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electrical load forecasting is of great importance for the efficient operation and control of modern power systems. In this work, a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model with online correction is developed for day-ahead electrical load forecasting. Firstly, four types of features are extracted from the original electrical load dataset, including the historical time series, time index features, historical statistical features, and similarity features. Then, a hybrid LSTM-based electrical load forecasting model is designed, where an LSTM neural network block and a fully-connected neural network block are integrated that can model both temporal features (historical time series) and non-temporal features (the rest features). A gradient regularization-based offline training algorithm and an output layer parameter fine-tuning-based online model correction method are developed to enhance the model's capabilities to defend against disturbance and adapt to the latest load data distribution, thus improving the forecasting accuracy. At last, extensive experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed electrical load forecasting strategy with superior accuracy compared with commonly used forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal prediction for multi-dimensional time series by ellipsoidal   sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03850v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction (CP) has been a popular method for uncertainty quantification because it is distribution-free, model-agnostic, and theoretically sound. For forecasting problems in supervised learning, most CP methods focus on building prediction intervals for univariate responses. In this work, we develop a sequential CP method called $\texttt{MultiDimSPCI}$ that builds prediction regions for a multivariate response, especially in the context of multivariate time series, which are not exchangeable. Theoretically, we estimate finite-sample high-probability bounds on the conditional coverage gap. Empirically, we demonstrate that $\texttt{MultiDimSPCI}$ maintains valid coverage on a wide range of multivariate time series while producing smaller prediction regions than CP and non-CP baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ancestor regression in structural vector autoregressive models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03778v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new method for causal discovery in linear structural vector autoregressive models. We adapt an idea designed for independent observations to the case of time series while retaining its favorable properties, i.e., explicit error control for false causal discovery, at least asymptotically. We apply our method to several real-world bivariate time series datasets and discuss its findings which mostly agree with common understanding. The arrow of time in a model can be interpreted as background knowledge on possible causal mechanisms. Hence, our ideas could be extended to incorporating different background knowledge, even for independent observations.</p></details> |  |
