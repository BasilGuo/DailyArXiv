| **[The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17156v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves, can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2 architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves 3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, ICML 2024 AI4Science workshop</p></details> |
| **[Spillover Detection for Donor Selection in Synthetic Control Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11399v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic control (SC) models are widely used to estimate causal effects in settings with observational time-series data. To identify the causal effect on a target unit, SC requires the existence of correlated units that are not impacted by the intervention. Given one of these potential donor units, how can we decide whether it is in fact a valid donor - that is, one not subject to spillover effects from the intervention? Such a decision typically requires appealing to strong a priori domain knowledge specifying the units, which becomes infeasible in situations with large pools of potential donors. In this paper, we introduce a practical, theoretically-grounded donor selection procedure, aiming to weaken this domain knowledge requirement. Our main result is a Theorem that yields the assumptions required to identify donor values at post-intervention time points using only pre-intervention data. We show how this Theorem - and the assumptions underpinning it - can be turned into a practical method for detecting potential spillover effects and excluding invalid donors when constructing SCs. Importantly, we employ sensitivity analysis to formally bound the bias in our SC causal estimate in situations where an excluded donor was indeed valid, or where a selected donor was invalid. Using ideas from the proximal causal inference and instrumental variables literature, we show that the excluded donors can nevertheless be leveraged to further debias causal effect estimates. Finally, we illustrate our donor selection procedure on both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Minusformer: Improving Time Series Forecasting by Progressively Learning Residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02332v3)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we find that ubiquitous time series (TS) forecasting models are prone to severe overfitting. To cope with this problem, we embrace a de-redundancy approach to progressively reinstate the intrinsic values of TS for future intervals. Specifically, we introduce a dual-stream and subtraction mechanism, which is a deep Boosting ensemble learning method. And the vanilla Transformer is renovated by reorienting the information aggregation mechanism from addition to subtraction. Then, we incorporate an auxiliary output branch into each block of the original model to construct a highway leading to the ultimate prediction. The output of subsequent modules in this branch will subtract the previously learned results, enabling the model to learn the residuals of the supervision signal, layer by layer. This designing facilitates the learning-driven implicit progressive decomposition of the input and output streams, empowering the model with heightened versatility, interpretability, and resilience against overfitting. Since all aggregations in the model are minus signs, which is called Minusformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding an average performance improvement of 11.9% across various datasets.The code has been released at https://github.com/Anoise/Minusformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Time Series Representation via Diffusion Process and Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting Mask](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05959v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Representation Learning (TSRL) focuses on generating informative representations for various Time Series (TS) modeling tasks. Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However, they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiority in imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering. We also conduct an ablation study, present embedding visualizations, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE's efficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a full paper by KDD 2024 Research Track (12 pages as main paper and 11 pages as appendix).

| **[ProbTS: Benchmarking Point and Distributional Forecasting across Diverse Prediction Horizons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07446v4)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delivering precise point and distributional forecasts across a spectrum of prediction horizons represents a significant and enduring challenge in the application of time-series forecasting within various industries. Prior research on developing deep learning models for time-series forecasting has often concentrated on isolated aspects, such as long-term point forecasting or short-term probabilistic estimations. This narrow focus may result in skewed methodological choices and hinder the adaptability of these models to uncharted scenarios. While there is a rising trend in developing universal forecasting models, a thorough understanding of their advantages and drawbacks, especially regarding essential forecasting needs like point and distributional forecasts across short and long horizons, is still lacking. In this paper, we present ProbTS, a benchmark tool designed as a unified platform to evaluate these fundamental forecasting needs and to conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of numerous cutting-edge studies from recent years. We dissect the distinctive data characteristics arising from disparate forecasting requirements and elucidate how these characteristics can skew methodological preferences in typical research trajectories, which often fail to fully accommodate essential forecasting needs. Building on this, we examine the latest models for universal time-series forecasting and discover that our analyses of methodological strengths and weaknesses are also applicable to these universal models. Finally, we outline the limitations inherent in current research and underscore several avenues for future exploration.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11217v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models , including GPT4, Claude3, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

| **[RATSF: Empowering Customer Service Volume Management through Retrieval-Augmented Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04180v2)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient customer service management system hinges on precise forecasting of service volume. In this scenario, where data non-stationarity is pronounced, successful forecasting heavily relies on identifying and leveraging similar historical data rather than merely summarizing periodic patterns. Existing models based on RNN or Transformer architectures may struggle with this flexible and effective utilization. To tackle this challenge, we initially developed the Time Series Knowledge Base (TSKB) with an advanced indexing system for efficient historical data retrieval. We also developed the Retrieval Augmented Cross-Attention (RACA) module, a variant of the cross-attention mechanism within Transformer's decoder layers, designed to be seamlessly integrated into the vanilla Transformer architecture to assimilate key historical data segments. The synergy between TSKB and RACA forms the backbone of our Retrieval-Augmented Time Series Forecasting (RATSF) framework. Based on the above two components, RATSF not only significantly enhances performance in the context of Fliggy hotel service volume forecasting but also adapts flexibly to various scenarios and integrates with a multitude of Transformer variants for time-series forecasting. Extensive experimentation has validated the effectiveness and generalizability of this system design across multiple diverse contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[First-Order Manifold Data Augmentation for Regression Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10914v1)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation (DA) methods tailored to specific domains generate synthetic samples by applying transformations that are appropriate for the characteristics of the underlying data domain, such as rotations on images and time warping on time series data. In contrast, domain-independent approaches, e.g. mixup, are applicable to various data modalities, and as such they are general and versatile. While regularizing classification tasks via DA is a well-explored research topic, the effect of DA on regression problems received less attention. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of domain-independent augmentation for regression, and we introduce FOMA: a new data-driven domain-independent data augmentation method. Essentially, our approach samples new examples from the tangent planes of the train distribution. Augmenting data in this way aligns with the network tendency towards capturing the dominant features of its input signals. We evaluate FOMA on in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness benchmarks, and we show that it improves the generalization of several neural architectures. We also find that strong baselines based on mixup are less effective in comparison to our approach. Our code is publicly available athttps://github.com/azencot-group/FOMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[LLMFactor: Extracting Profitable Factors through Prompts for Explainable Stock Movement Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10811v1)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for their exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks, particularly in text analysis. However, the finance sector presents a distinct challenge due to its dependence on time-series data for complex forecasting tasks. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called LLMFactor, which employs Sequential Knowledge-Guided Prompting (SKGP) to identify factors that influence stock movements using LLMs. Unlike previous methods that relied on keyphrases or sentiment analysis, this approach focuses on extracting factors more directly related to stock market dynamics, providing clear explanations for complex temporal changes. Our framework directs the LLMs to create background knowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential factors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background knowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in textual format to predict stock movement. An extensive evaluation of the LLMFactor framework across four benchmark datasets from both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrates its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods and its effectiveness in financial time-series forecasting.</p></details> | ACL(Findings)2024 |
| **[Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14989v4)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2024, Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[SiBBlInGS: Similarity-driven Building-Block Inference using Graphs across States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04817v4)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data across scientific domains are often collected under distinct states (e.g., tasks), wherein latent processes (e.g., biological factors) create complex inter- and intra-state variability. A key approach to capture this complexity is to uncover fundamental interpretable units within the data, Building Blocks (BBs), which modulate their activity and adjust their structure across observations. Existing methods for identifying BBs in multi-way data often overlook inter- vs. intra-state variability, produce uninterpretable components, or do not align with properties of real-world data, such as missing samples and sessions of different duration. Here, we present a framework for Similarity-driven Building Block Inference using Graphs across States (SiBBlInGS). SiBBlInGS offers a graph-based dictionary learning approach for discovering sparse BBs along with their temporal traces, based on co-activity patterns and inter- vs. intra-state relationships. Moreover, SiBBlInGS captures per-trial temporal variability and controlled cross-state structural BB adaptations, identifies state-specific vs. state-invariant components, and accommodates variability in the number and duration of observed sessions across states. We demonstrate SiBBlInGS's ability to reveal insights into complex phenomena as well as its robustness to noise and missing samples through several synthetic and real-world examples, including web search and neural data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Flexible Time-windowed Granger Causality Integrating Heterogeneous Interventional Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10419v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Granger causality, commonly used for inferring causal structures from time series data, has been adopted in widespread applications across various fields due to its intuitive explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural network prediction models. To alleviate challenges in better deciphering causal structures unambiguously from time series, the use of interventional data has become a practical approach. However, existing methods have yet to be explored in the context of imperfect interventions with unknown targets, which are more common and often more beneficial in a wide range of real-world applications. Additionally, the identifiability issues of Granger causality with unknown interventional targets in complex network models remain unsolved. Our work presents a theoretically-grounded method that infers Granger causal structure and identifies unknown targets by leveraging heterogeneous interventional time series data. We further illustrate that learning Granger causal structure and recovering interventional targets can mutually promote each other. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several robust baseline methods in learning Granger causal structure from interventional time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[SigDiffusions: Score-Based Diffusion Models for Long Time Series via Log-Signature Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10354v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have recently emerged as state-of-the-art generative models for a variety of data modalities. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to adapt these models to generate long multivariate time series. Viewing a time series as the discretization of an underlying continuous process, we introduce SigDiffusion, a novel diffusion model operating on log-signature embeddings of the data. The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining SigDiffusion with these inversion formulae results in highly realistic time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysing Multi-Task Regression via Random Matrix Theory with Application to Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10327v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for multi-task regression, applying random matrix theory to provide precise performance estimations, under high-dimensional, non-Gaussian data distributions. We formulate a multi-task optimization problem as a regularization technique to enable single-task models to leverage multi-task learning information. We derive a closed-form solution for multi-task optimization in the context of linear models. Our analysis provides valuable insights by linking the multi-task learning performance to various model statistics such as raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, as well as the size and number of datasets. We finally propose a consistent estimation of training and testing errors, thereby offering a robust foundation for hyperparameter optimization in multi-task regression scenarios. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets in regression and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate improvements on univariate models, incorporating our method into the training loss and thus leveraging multivariate information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal randomised signatures for generative time series modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10214v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomised signature has been proposed as a flexible and easily implementable alternative to the well-established path signature. In this article, we employ randomised signature to introduce a generative model for financial time series data in the spirit of reservoir computing. Specifically, we propose a novel Wasserstein-type distance based on discrete-time randomised signatures. This metric on the space of probability measures captures the distance between (conditional) distributions. Its use is justified by our novel universal approximation results for randomised signatures on the space of continuous functions taking the underlying path as an input. We then use our metric as the loss function in a non-adversarial generator model for synthetic time series data based on a reservoir neural stochastic differential equation. We compare the results of our model to benchmarks from the existing literature.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Although transformer-based models have made significant progress in ECG classification, they exhibit inefficiencies in the inference phase. The issue is primarily attributable to the secondary computational complexity of Transformer's self-attention mechanism. particularly when processing lengthy sequences. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, ECGMamba, which employs a bidirectional state-space model (BiSSM) to enhance classification efficiency. ECGMamba is based on the innovative Mamba-based block, which incorporates a range of time series modeling techniques to enhance performance while maintaining the efficiency of inference. The experimental results on two publicly available ECG datasets demonstrate that ECGMamba effectively balances the effectiveness and efficiency of classification, achieving competitive performance. This study not only contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of ECG classification but also provides a new research path for efficient and accurate ECG signal analysis. This is of guiding significance for the development of diagnostic models for cardiovascular diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.17858 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Extreme value methods for estimating rare events in Utopia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09825v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To capture the extremal behaviour of complex environmental phenomena in practice, flexi\-ble techniques for modelling tail behaviour are required. In this paper, we introduce a variety of such methods, which were used by the Lancopula Utopiversity team to tackle the EVA (2023) Conference Data Challenge. This data challenge was split into four challenges, labelled C1-C4. Challenges C1 and C2 comprise univariate problems, where the goal is to estimate extreme quantiles for a non-stationary time series exhibiting several complex features. For these, we propose a flexible modelling technique, based on generalised additive models, with diagnostics indicating generally good performance for the observed data. Challenges C3 and C4 concern multivariate problems where the focus is on estimating joint extremal probabilities. For challenge C3, we propose an extension of available models in the multivariate literature and use this framework to estimate extreme probabilities in the presence of non-stationary dependence. Finally, for challenge C4, which concerns a 50 dimensional random vector, we employ a clustering technique to achieve dimension reduction and use a conditional modelling approach to estimate extremal probabilities across independent groups of variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages (inc. supplementary)</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive review of the relevant approaches and propose a novel approach leveraging a Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Classifier (TMTSC) for predicting the success likelihood of any candidate company. The objective of our research is to optimize sourcing performance for VC and GC investments by formally defining the sourcing problem as a multivariate time series classification task. We consecutively introduce the key components of our implementation which collectively contribute to the successful application of TMTSC in VC/GC sourcing: input features, model architecture, optimization target, and investor-centric data processing. Our extensive experiments on two real-world investment tasks, benchmarked towards three popular baselines, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving decision making within the VC and GC industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by ICANN (33rd International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks) 2024 as full paper (15 pages and 7 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Graphical Linear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03210v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series datasets are central in machine learning with applications in numerous fields of science and engineering, such as biomedicine, Earth observation, and network analysis. Extensive research exists on state-space models (SSMs), which are powerful mathematical tools that allow for probabilistic and interpretable learning on time series. Learning the model parameters in SSMs is arguably one of the most complicated tasks, and the inclusion of prior knowledge is known to both ease the interpretation but also to complicate the inferential tasks. Very recent works have attempted to incorporate a graphical perspective on some of those model parameters, but they present notable limitations that this work addresses. More generally, existing graphical modeling tools are designed to incorporate either static information, focusing on statistical dependencies among independent random variables (e.g., graphical Lasso approach), or dynamic information, emphasizing causal relationships among time series samples (e.g., graphical Granger approaches). However, there are no joint approaches combining static and dynamic graphical modeling within the context of SSMs. This work proposes a novel approach to fill this gap by introducing a joint graphical modeling framework that bridges the graphical Lasso model and a causal-based graphical approach for the linear-Gaussian SSM. We present DGLASSO (Dynamic Graphical Lasso), a new inference method within this framework that implements an efficient block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm. The algorithm's convergence is established by departing from modern tools from nonlinear analysis. Experimental validation on various synthetic data showcases the effectiveness of the proposed model and inference algorithm.</p></details> |  |

This reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets for each new task, saving both time and resources by leveraging the broad knowledge base established during pretraining. Most research on FMs has primarily focused on unstructured data, such as text and images, or semi-structured data, like time-series. However, there has been limited attention to structured data, such as tabular data, which, despite its prevalence, remains under-studied due to a lack of clean datasets and insufficient research on the transferability of FMs for various tabular data tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce a framework called TabularFM (\url{https://tabularfm.github.io/}), which incorporates state-of-the-art methods for developing FMs specifically for tabular data. This includes variations of neural architectures such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers. We have curated a million of tabular datasets and released cleaned versions to facilitate the development of tabular FMs. We pretrained FMs on this curated data, benchmarked various learning methods on these datasets, and released the pretrained models along with leaderboards for future comparative studies. Our fully open-sourced system provides a comprehensive analysis of the transferability of tabular FMs. By releasing these datasets, pretrained models, and leaderboards, we aim to enhance the validity and usability of tabular FMs in the near future.</p></details> |  |

While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior.

In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, + Supplemental Materials, Accepted at ECML PKDD 2024 (European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

| **[TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01638v3)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of scalable mobile sensing has led to large amounts of time series data for real-world applications. A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep learning for precipitation nowcasting: A survey from the perspective of time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04867v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based time series forecasting has dominated the short-term precipitation forecasting field with the help of its ability to estimate motion flow in high-resolution datasets. The growing interest in precipitation nowcasting offers substantial opportunities for the advancement of current forecasting technologies. Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of in-depth surveys of time series precipitation forecasting using deep learning. Thus, this paper systemically reviews recent progress in time series precipitation forecasting models. Specifically, we investigate the following key points within background components, covering: i) preprocessing, ii) objective functions, and iii) evaluation metrics. We then categorize forecasting models into \textit{recursive} and \textit{multiple} strategies based on their approaches to predict future frames, investigate the impacts of models using the strategies, and performance assessments. Finally, we evaluate current deep learning-based models for precipitation forecasting on a public benchmark, discuss their limitations and challenges, and present some promising research directions. Our contribution lies in providing insights for a better understanding of time series precipitation forecasting and in aiding the development of robust AI solutions for the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

These models typically involve a decoder trained using either its previous forecasts or the actual observed values as the decoder inputs. However, relying on self-generated predictions can lead to the rapid accumulation of errors over multiple steps, while using the actual observations introduces exposure bias as these values are unavailable during the extrapolation stage. In this regard, this study proposes a novel training approach called reinforced decoder, which introduces auxiliary models to generate alternative decoder inputs that remain accessible when extrapolating. Additionally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to dynamically select the optimal inputs to improve accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms representative training methods over several datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach also exhibits promising performance when generalized to self-attention-based sequence-to-sequence forecasting models.</p></details> | 12 pages,8 figures |
| **[Time Series Forecasting with Many Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09625v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for time series forecasting with many predictors, referred to as the GO-sdPCA, in this paper. The approach employs a variable selection method known as the group orthogonal greedy algorithm and the high-dimensional Akaike information criterion to mitigate the impact of irrelevant predictors. Moreover, a novel technique, called peeling, is used to boost the variable selection procedure so that many factor-relevant predictors can be included in prediction. Finally, the supervised dynamic principal component analysis (sdPCA) method is adopted to account for the dynamic information in factor recovery. In simulation studies, we found that the proposed method adapts well to unknown degrees of sparsity and factor strength, which results in good performance even when the number of relevant predictors is large compared to the sample size. Applying to economic and environmental studies, the proposed method consistently performs well compared to some commonly used benchmarks in one-step-ahead out-sample forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Changes by Butterflies: Farsighted Forecasting with Group Reservoir Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09573v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Chaos, a minor divergence between two initial conditions exhibits exponential amplification over time, leading to far-away outcomes, known as the butterfly effect. Thus, the distant future is full of uncertainty and hard to forecast. We introduce Group Reservoir Transformer to predict long-term events more accurately and robustly by overcoming two challenges in Chaos: (1) the extensive historical sequences and (2) the sensitivity to initial conditions. A reservoir is attached to a Transformer to efficiently handle arbitrarily long historical lengths, with an extension of a group of reservoirs to reduce the sensitivity to the initialization variations. Our architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in multivariate time series, including TimeLLM, GPT2TS, PatchTST, DLinear, TimeNet, and the baseline Transformer, with an error reduction of up to -59\% in various fields such as ETTh, ETTm, and air quality, demonstrating that an ensemble of butterfly learning can improve the adequacy and certainty of event prediction, despite of the traveling time to the unknown future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning with little mixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08269v3)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study square loss in a realizable time-series framework with martingale difference noise. Our main result is a fast rate excess risk bound which shows that whenever a trajectory hypercontractivity condition holds, the risk of the least-squares estimator on dependent data matches the iid rate order-wise after a burn-in time. In comparison, many existing results in learning from dependent data have rates where the effective sample size is deflated by a factor of the mixing-time of the underlying process, even after the burn-in time. Furthermore, our results allow the covariate process to exhibit long range correlations which are substantially weaker than geometric ergodicity. We call this phenomenon learning with little mixing, and present several examples for when it occurs: bounded function classes for which the $L^2$ and $L^{2+\epsilon}$ norms are equivalent, ergodic finite state Markov chains, various parametric models, and a broad family of infinite dimensional $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ ellipsoids. By instantiating our main result to system identification of nonlinear dynamics with generalized linear model transitions, we obtain a nearly minimax optimal excess risk bound after only a polynomial burn-in time.</p></details> |  |
| **[How & Why To Use Audience Segmentation to Maximize (Listener) Demand Across Digital Music Portfolio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09226v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital delivery of songs has radically changed the way people can enjoy music, the sort of music available for listening, and the manner by which rights holders are compensated for their contributions to songs. Listeners enjoy an unlimited potpourri of sounds, uniquely free of incremental acquisition or switching costs which have been replaced by subscription or rentier fees. This regime shift has revealed listening patterns governed by affinity, boredom, attention budget, etc.: instantaneous, dynamic, organic or programmatic song selection. This regime shift in demand availability -- with the commensurate translation of revenue implications -- deprecates current orthodoxy for content curation. The impulse to point-of-sale model is insufficient in a regime where demand revenue is proportional to demand affinity and each are strongly dependent time series processes. We explore strategies & implications -- which are generalizable to any media rights holding firm -- from a prediction & optimization point of view for two straightforward demand models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

We show that \emph{Random Duality Theory} (RDT) can be utilized to obtain precise closed form characterizations of all estimators related optimizing quantities of interest, including the \emph{prediction risk} (testing or generalization error). On a qualitative level out results recover the risk's well known non-monotonic (so-called double-descent) behavior as the number of features/sample size ratio increases. On a quantitative level, our closed form results show how the risk explicitly depends on all key model parameters, including the problem dimensions and covariance matrices. Moreover, a special case of our results, obtained when intra-sample (or time-series) correlations are not present, precisely match the corresponding ones obtained via spectral methods in [6,16,17,24].</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series Forecasting for Out-of-Distribution Generalization Using Invariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09130v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF. To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Time Elastic Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17516v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zoom and Shift are All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08866v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature alignment serves as the primary mechanism for fusing multimodal data. We put forth a feature alignment approach that achieves full integration of multimodal information. This is accomplished via an alternating process of shifting and expanding feature representations across modalities to obtain a consistent unified representation in a joint feature space. The proposed technique can reliably capture high-level interplay between features originating from distinct modalities. Consequently, substantial gains in multimodal learning performance are attained. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other prevalent multimodal fusion schemes on a range of tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation conducted on multimodal datasets comprising time series, image, and text demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Evidentially Calibrated Source-Free Time-Series Domain Adaptation with Temporal Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02635v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model pre-trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data, preserving the source domain's privacy. While SFDA is prevalent in computer vision, it remains largely unexplored in time series analysis. Existing SFDA methods, designed for visual data, struggle to capture the inherent temporal dynamics of time series, hindering adaptation performance. This paper proposes MAsk And imPUte (MAPU), a novel and effective approach for time series SFDA. MAPU addresses the critical challenge of temporal consistency by introducing a novel temporal imputation task. This task involves randomly masking time series signals and leveraging a dedicated temporal imputer to recover the original signal within the learned embedding space, bypassing the complexities of noisy raw data. Notably, MAPU is the first method to explicitly address temporal consistency in the context of time series SFDA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with existing SFDA methods, providing greater flexibility. We further introduce E-MAPU, which incorporates evidential uncertainty estimation to address the overconfidence issue inherent in softmax predictions. To achieve that, we leverage evidential deep learning to obtain a better-calibrated pre-trained model and adapt the target encoder to map out-of-support target samples to a new feature representation closer to the source domain's support. This fosters better alignment, ultimately enhancing adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world time series datasets demonstrate that both MAPU and E-MAPU achieve significant performance gains compared to existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for tackling various time series domain adaptation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Knowledge Pruning for Time Series Data Analytics on Edge-computing Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08765v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limited by the scale and diversity of time series data, the neural networks trained on time series data often overfit and show unsatisfacotry performances. In comparison, large language models (LLMs) recently exhibit impressive generalization in diverse fields. Although massive LLM based approaches are proposed for time series tasks, these methods require to load the whole LLM in both training and reference. This high computational demands limit practical applications in resource-constrained settings, like edge-computing and IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Pruning (KP), a novel paradigm for time series learning in this paper. For a specific downstream task, we argue that the world knowledge learned by LLMs is much redundant and only the related knowledge termed as "pertinent knowledge" is useful. Unlike other methods, our KP targets to prune the redundant knowledge and only distill the pertinent knowledge into the target model. This reduces model size and computational costs significantly. Additionally, different from existing LLM based approaches, our KP does not require to load the LLM in the process of training and testing, further easing computational burdens. With our proposed KP, a lightweight network can effectively learn the pertinent knowledge, achieving satisfactory performances with a low computation cost. To verify the effectiveness of our KP, two fundamental tasks on edge-computing devices are investigated in our experiments, where eight diverse environments or benchmarks with different networks are used to verify the generalization of our KP. Through experiments, our KP demonstrates effective learning of pertinent knowledge, achieving notable performance improvements in regression (19.7% on average) and classification (up to 13.7%) tasks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Adapting the similarity-based framework of Lin and Eck (2020), we exploit series that have experienced similar shocks. We aggregate their shock-induced excess volatilities by positing the shocks to be affine functions of exogenous covariates. The volatility shocks are modeled as random effects and estimated as fixed effects. The aggregation of these estimates is done in service of adjusting the $h$-step-ahead GARCH forecast of the time series under study by an additive term. The adjusted and unadjusted forecasts are evaluated using the unobservable but easily-estimated realized volatility (RV). A real-world application is provided, as are simulation results suggesting the conditions and hyperparameters under which our method thrives.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prediction Risk and Estimation Risk of the Ridgeless Least Squares Estimator under General Assumptions on Regression Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12883v3)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a significant growth in research focusing on minimum $\ell_2$ norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimators. However, the majority of these analyses have been limited to an unrealistic regression error structure, assuming independent and identically distributed errors with zero mean and common variance. In this paper, we explore prediction risk as well as estimation risk under more general regression error assumptions, highlighting the benefits of overparameterization in a more realistic setting that allows for clustered or serial dependence. Notably, we establish that the estimation difficulties associated with the variance components of both risks can be summarized through the trace of the variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors. Our findings suggest that the benefits of overparameterization can extend to time series, panel and grouped data.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Time-MMD: A New Multi-Domain Multimodal Dataset for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08627v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA. The dataset and library are available at https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD and https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM-TSFlib.</p></details> |  |

The study of such properties on dependent data is still a challenge. In this paper, we carry out deep learning from strongly mixing observations, and deal with the squared and a broad class of loss functions. We consider sparse-penalized regularization for deep neural network predictor. For a general framework that includes, regression estimation, classification, time series prediction,$\cdots$, oracle inequality for the expected excess risk is established and a bound on the class of H\"older smooth functions is provided. For nonparametric regression from strong mixing data and sub-exponentially error, we provide an oracle inequality for the $L_2$ error and investigate an upper bound of this error on a class of H\"older composition functions. For the specific case of nonparametric autoregression with Gaussian and Laplace errors, a lower bound of the $L_2$ error on this H\"older composition class is established. Up to logarithmic factor, this bound matches its upper bound; so, the deep neural network estimator attains the minimax optimal rate.</p></details> |  |

Modern strategies rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pose this problem as rigid registration. Yet, CNNs do not exploit natural symmetries in this task, as they are equivariant to translations (their outputs shift with their inputs) but not to rotations. Here we propose EquiTrack, the first method that uses recent steerable SE(3)-equivariant CNNs (E-CNN) for motion tracking. While steerable E-CNNs can extract corresponding features across different poses, testing them on noisy medical images reveals that they do not have enough learning capacity to learn noise invariance. Thus, we introduce a hybrid architecture that pairs a denoiser with an E-CNN to decouple the processing of anatomically irrelevant intensity features from the extraction of equivariant spatial features. Rigid transforms are then estimated in closed-form. EquiTrack outperforms state-of-the-art learning and optimisation methods for motion tracking in adult brain MRI and fetal MRI time series. Our code is available at https://github.com/BBillot/EquiTrack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE transactions on Medical Imaging</p></details> |

Analysing the nodality of British MPs and journalists on Twitter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08765v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Who sets the policy agenda? In this paper, we explore the roles of policy actors in agenda setting by studying their relative influence in policy-related discussions. Our approach builds on ``nodality'' \textemdash a concept in political science that determines the capacity of an actor to share information and to be at the centre of information networks. We propose a novel methodology that quantifies the nodality of all individual actors in any conversation by analysing a comprehensive set of their centrality measures in the related information network. We combine this with the analysis of the activity time-series, of the related conversation (or topic), to demonstrate how nodality scores relate to the capacity to drive topic-related activity. Here we analyse policy-related discussions on X (previously Twitter) and quantify the nodality of two sets of actors in the UK political system \textemdash Members of Parliament (MPs) and accredited journalists - on four policy topics: The Russia-Ukraine War, the Cost-of-Living Crisis, Brexit and COVID-19. Our results show that the capacity to influence the activity related to a topic is significantly and positively associated with nodality. In particular, we identify two dimensions of nodality that drive the capacity to influence topic-related activity. The first is ``active nodality", which reflects the level of topic-related engagement an individual actor has on the platform. The second dimension is ``inherent nodality" which is entirely independent of the platform and reflects the actor's institutional position (such as an MP in a front-bench role, or a journalist's position at a prominent media outlet).</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[SOFTS: Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Series-Core Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14197v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, \textit{e.g.}, attention, STAR employs a centralized strategy to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on the quality of each channel. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively.SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAR module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. For further research and development, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the potential of addressing spatial-temporal forecasting problems using general time series forecasting models, i.e., models that do not leverage the spatial relationships among the nodes. We propose a all-Multi-Layer Perceptron (all-MLP) time series forecasting architecture called RPMixer. The all-MLP architecture was chosen due to its recent success in time series forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, our method capitalizes on the ensemble-like behavior of deep neural networks, where each individual block within the network behaves like a base learner in an ensemble model, particularly when identity mapping residual connections are incorporated. By integrating random projection layers into our model, we increase the diversity among the blocks' outputs, thereby improving the overall performance of the network. Extensive experiments conducted on the largest spatial-temporal forecasting benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternative methods, including both spatial-temporal graph models and general forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

Efficiency in DNNs can be achieved through sparse connectivity and reducing the model size. However, finding the sparsity level automatically during training remains challenging due to the heterogeneity in the loss-sparsity tradeoffs across the datasets. In this paper, we propose \enquote{\textbf{P}runing with \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}parsity \textbf{L}evel} (\textbf{PALS}), to automatically seek a decent balance between loss and sparsity, all without the need for a predefined sparsity level. PALS draws inspiration from sparse training and during-training methods. It introduces the novel "expand" mechanism in training sparse neural networks, allowing the model to dynamically shrink, expand, or remain stable to find a proper sparsity level. In this paper, we focus on achieving efficiency in transformers known for their excellent time series forecasting performance but high computational cost. Nevertheless, PALS can be applied directly to any DNN. To this aim, we demonstrate its effectiveness also on the DLinear model. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets and five state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer variants show that PALS substantially reduces model size while maintaining comparable performance to the dense model. More interestingly, PALS even outperforms the dense model, in \textcolor{blue}{12} and \textcolor{blue}{14} cases out of 30 cases in terms of MSE and MAE loss, respectively, while reducing \textcolor{blue}{65\%} parameter count and \textcolor{blue}{63\%} FLOPs on average.

The applicability of quantum simulations and quantum metrology techniques for modelling complex physical systems and achieving high-resolution measurements are proposed. The impacts of various parameter distributions and learning rates on predictive accuracy are investigated. Modelling the time evolution of physical systems Hamiltonian simulation and the product formula procedure are adopted. The time block method is analyzed in order to reduce simulation errors, while the Schatten-infinite norm is used to evaluate the simulation precision. Methodology requires estimation of optimized parameters by minimizing loss functions and resource needs. For this purpose, the mathematical formulations of Cramer Rao Bound and Fischer Information are indispensable requirements. The impact of learning rates on regulating the loss function for various parameter values. Using parameterized quantum circuits, the article outlines a four-step procedure for extracting information.

The study analyses variational unitary circuits with optimized parameter estimation for more precise predictions.

Current explanation methods for MTS mostly focus on time-centric explanations, apt for pinpointing important time periods but less effective in identifying key features. This limitation underscores the pressing need for a feature-centric approach, a vital yet often overlooked perspective that complements time-centric analysis. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel feature-centric explanation and evaluation framework for MTS, named CAFO (Channel Attention and Feature Orthgonalization). CAFO employs a convolution-based approach with channel attention mechanisms, incorporating a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) and a QR decomposition-based loss for promoting feature-wise orthogonality. We demonstrate that this orthogonalization enhances the separability of attention distributions, thereby refining and stabilizing the ranking of feature importance. This improvement in feature-wise ranking enhances our understanding of feature explainability in MTS. Furthermore, we develop metrics to evaluate global and class-specific feature importance. Our framework's efficacy is validated through extensive empirical analyses on two major public benchmarks and real-world datasets, both synthetic and self-collected, specifically designed to highlight class-wise discriminative features. The results confirm CAFO's robustness and informative capacity in assessing feature importance in MTS classification tasks. This study not only advances the understanding of feature-centric explanations in MTS but also sets a foundation for future explorations in feature-centric explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD 2024 Research Track</p></details> |

A multiway cointegration, causality, and dynamic connectedness analyses on factors influencing offshore decisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07525v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled multinational corporations to diversify their global supply chain risk and to relocate their factories to Southeast Asian countries beyond China. Such recent phenomena provide a good opportunity to understand the factors that influenced offshore decisions in the last two decades. We propose a new conceptual framework based on econometric approaches to examine the relationships between these factors. Firstly, the Vector Auto Regression (VAR) for multi-way cointegration analysis by a Johansen test as well as the embedding Granger causality analysis to examine offshore decisions--innovation, technology readiness, infrastructure, foreign direct investment (FDI), and intermediate imports. Secondly, a Quantile Vector Autoregressive (QVAR) model is used to assess the dynamic connectedness among Southeast Asian countries based on the offshore factors. This study explores a system-wide experiment to evaluate the spillover effects of offshore decisions. It reports a comprehensive analysis using time-series data collected from the World Bank. The results of the cointegration, causality, and dynamic connectedness analyses show that a subset of Southeast Asian countries have spillover effects on each other. These countries present a multi-way cointegration and dynamic connectedness relationship. The study contributes to policymaking by providing a data-driven innovative approach through a new conceptual framework.</p></details> | 30 pages |

It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average. Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/ClaudiaShu/DeformTime</p></details> |
| **[CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02131v3)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Calibration of Time-Series Forecasting: Detecting and Adapting Context-Driven Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14838v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of introducing deep learning models to time series forecasting. From a data generation perspective, we illustrate that existing models are susceptible to distribution shifts driven by temporal contexts, whether observed or unobserved. Such context-driven distribution shift (CDS) introduces biases in predictions within specific contexts and poses challenges for conventional training paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a universal calibration methodology for the detection and adaptation of CDS with a trained model. To this end, we propose a novel CDS detector, termed the "residual-based CDS detector" or "Reconditionor", which quantifies the model's vulnerability to CDS by evaluating the mutual information between prediction residuals and their corresponding contexts. A high Reconditionor score indicates a severe susceptibility, thereby necessitating model adaptation. In this circumstance, we put forth a straightforward yet potent adapter framework for model calibration, termed the "sample-level contextualized adapter" or "SOLID". This framework involves the curation of a contextually similar dataset to the provided test sample and the subsequent fine-tuning of the model's prediction layer with a limited number of steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this adaptation strategy can achieve an optimal bias-variance trade-off. Notably, our proposed Reconditionor and SOLID are model-agnostic and readily adaptable to a wide range of models. Extensive experiments show that SOLID consistently enhances the performance of current forecasting models on real-world datasets, especially on cases with substantial CDS detected by the proposed Reconditionor, thus validating the effectiveness of the calibration approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD'2...</summary><p>KDD'24 research paper</p></details> |

Neural CDEs (NCDEs) treat time series data as observations from a control path, parameterise a CDE's vector field using a neural network, and use the solution path as a continuously evolving hidden state. As their formulation makes them robust to irregular sampling rates, NCDEs are a powerful approach for modelling real-world data. Building on neural rough differential equations (NRDEs), we introduce Log-NCDEs, a novel, effective, and efficient method for training NCDEs. The core component of Log-NCDEs is the Log-ODE method, a tool from the study of rough paths for approximating a CDE's solution. Log-NCDEs are shown to outperform NCDEs, NRDEs, the linear recurrent unit, S5, and MAMBA on a range of multivariate time series datasets with up to $50{,}000$ observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning 2024</p></details> |

While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is the more expressive model with better predictive performance, we will show that it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: it does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. Also, TACTiS does not provide any guarantees for marginalization consistency. We develop a novel probabilistic irregular time series forecasting model, Marginalization Consistent Mixtures of Separable Flows (moses), that mixes several normalizing flows with (i) Gaussian Processes with full covariance matrix as source distributions and (ii) a separable invertible transformation, aiming to combine the expressivity of normalizing flows with the marginalization consistency of Gaussians. In experiments on four different datasets we show that moses outperforms other state-of-the-art marginalization consistent models, performs on par with ProFITi, but different from ProFITi, guarantee marginalization consistency.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work & Under review; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |
| **[Calibrating Car-Following Models via Bayesian Dynamic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03340v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Car-following behavior modeling is critical for understanding traffic flow dynamics and developing high-fidelity microscopic simulation models. Most existing impulse-response car-following models prioritize computational efficiency and interpretability by using a parsimonious nonlinear function based on immediate preceding state observations. However, this approach disregards historical information, limiting its ability to explain real-world driving data. Consequently, serially correlated residuals are commonly observed when calibrating these models with actual trajectory data, hindering their ability to capture complex and stochastic phenomena. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic regression framework incorporating time series models, such as autoregressive processes, to capture error dynamics. This statistically rigorous calibration outperforms the simple assumption of independent errors and enables more accurate simulation and prediction by leveraging higher-order historical information. We validate the effectiveness of our framework using HighD and OpenACC data, demonstrating improved probabilistic simulations. In summary, our framework preserves the parsimonious nature of traditional car-following models while offering enhanced probabilistic simulations. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/Chengyuan-Zhang/IDM_Bayesian_Calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[DecoR: Deconfounding Time Series with Robust Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07005v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference on time series data is a challenging problem, especially in the presence of unobserved confounders. This work focuses on estimating the causal effect between two time series, which are confounded by a third, unobserved time series. Assuming spectral sparsity of the confounder, we show how in the frequency domain this problem can be framed as an adversarial outlier problem. We introduce Deconfounding by Robust regression (DecoR), a novel approach that estimates the causal effect using robust linear regression in the frequency domain. Considering two different robust regression techniques, we first improve existing bounds on the estimation error for such techniques. Crucially, our results do not require distributional assumptions on the covariates. We can therefore use them in time series settings. Applying these results to DecoR, we prove, under suitable assumptions, upper bounds for the estimation error of DecoR that imply consistency. We show DecoR's effectiveness through experiments on synthetic data. Our experiments furthermore suggest that our method is robust with respect to model misspecification.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Low Rank Multi-Dictionary Selection at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06960v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparse dictionary coding framework represents signals as a linear combination of a few predefined dictionary atoms. It has been employed for images, time series, graph signals and recently for 2-way (or 2D) spatio-temporal data employing jointly temporal and spatial dictionaries. Large and over-complete dictionaries enable high-quality models, but also pose scalability challenges which are exacerbated in multi-dictionary settings. Hence, an important problem that we address in this paper is: How to scale multi-dictionary coding for large dictionaries and datasets? We propose a multi-dictionary atom selection technique for low-rank sparse coding named LRMDS. To enable scalability to large dictionaries and datasets, it progressively selects groups of row-column atom pairs based on their alignment with the data and performs convex relaxation coding via the corresponding sub-dictionaries. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that when the data has a low-rank encoding with a sparse subset of the atoms, LRMDS is able to select them with strong guarantees under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability and quality of LRMDS in both synthetic and real-world datasets and for a range of coding dictionaries. It achieves 3X to 10X speed-up compared to baselines, while obtaining up to two orders of magnitude improvement in representation quality on some of the real world datasets given a fixed target number of atoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, August 25--29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |
| **[Nonlinear time-series embedding by monotone variational inequality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06894v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the wild, we often encounter collections of sequential data such as electrocardiograms, motion capture, genomes, and natural language, and sequences may be multichannel or symbolic with nonlinear dynamics. We introduce a new method to learn low-dimensional representations of nonlinear time series without supervision and can have provable recovery guarantees. The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning what to Learn: heterogeneous observations of dynamics and establishing (possibly causal) relations among them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06812v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before we attempt to learn a function between two (sets of) observables of a physical process, we must first decide what the inputs and what the outputs of the desired function are going to be. Here we demonstrate two distinct, data-driven ways of initially deciding ``the right quantities'' to relate through such a function, and then proceed to learn it. This is accomplished by processing multiple simultaneous heterogeneous data streams (ensembles of time series) from observations of a physical system: multiple observation processes of the system. We thus determine (a) what subsets of observables are common between the observation processes (and therefore observable from each other, relatable through a function); and (b) what information is unrelated to these common observables, and therefore particular to each observation process, and not contributing to the desired function. Any data-driven function approximation technique can subsequently be used to learn the input-output relation, from k-nearest neighbors and Geometric Harmonics to Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks. Two particular ``twists'' of the approach are discussed. The first has to do with the identifiability of particular quantities of interest from the measurements. We now construct mappings from a single set of observations of one process to entire level sets of measurements of the process, consistent with this single set. The second attempts to relate our framework to a form of causality: if one of the observation processes measures ``now'', while the second observation process measures ``in the future'', the function to be learned among what is common across observation processes constitutes a dynamical model for the system evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary De Bruijn Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16921v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary time series data are very common in many applications, and are typically modelled independently via a Bernoulli process with a single probability of success. However, the probability of a success can be dependent on the outcome successes of past events. Presented here is a novel approach for modelling binary time series data called a binary de Bruijn process which takes into account temporal correlation. The structure is derived from de Bruijn Graphs - a directed graph, where given a set of symbols, V, and a 'word' length, m, the nodes of the graph consist of all possible sequences of V of length m. De Bruijn Graphs are equivalent to mth order Markov chains, where the 'word' length controls the number of states that each individual state is dependent on. This increases correlation over a wider area. To quantify how clustered a sequence generated from a de Bruijn process is, the run lengths of letters are observed along with run length properties. Inference is also presented along with two application examples: precipitation data and the Oxford and Cambridge boat race.</p></details> |  |

Despite the limited size of these datasets, we achieved classification accuracy improvements in 10 out of 13 datasets using the Rocket and InceptionTime models. This highlights the essential role of sufficient data in training effective models, paralleling the advancements seen in computer vision. Our work delves into adapting and applying existing methods in innovative ways to the domain of multivariate time series classification. Our comprehensive exploration of these techniques sets a new standard for addressing data scarcity in time series analysis, emphasizing that diverse augmentation strategies are crucial for unlocking the potential of both traditional and deep learning models. Moreover, by meticulously analyzing and applying a variety of augmentation techniques, we demonstrate that strategic data enrichment can enhance model accuracy. This not only establishes a benchmark for future research in time series analysis but also underscores the importance of adopting varied augmentation approaches to improve model performance in the face of limited data availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Multivariate Time Series Analytics (MulTiSA), ICDE Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Continuum Attention for Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06486v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which we prove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</p></details> |  |

However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into such tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring. Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3) prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes. For the first task we designed 857 case studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-world scenarios in sleep and fitness. Through comprehensive evaluation of domain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are not statistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while experts remain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvements in using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleep insights. We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleep medicine and fitness examinations. PH-LLM achieved 79% on sleep and 88% on fitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts. Finally, we trained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual and multimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate that multimodal encoding is required to match performance of specialized discriminative models. Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these results demonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and the benefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applications as done with PH-LLM.</p></details> | 72 pages |

In contrast to conventional static image datasets, event-based neuromorphic datasets present heightened complexity in feature extraction due to their distinctive time series and sparsity characteristics, which influences their classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach termed Neuromorphic Momentum Contrast Learning (NeuroMoCo) for SNNs is introduced in this paper by extending the benefits of self-supervised pre-training to SNNs to effectively stimulate their potential. This is the first time that self-supervised learning (SSL) based on momentum contrastive learning is realized in SNNs. In addition, we devise a novel loss function named MixInfoNCE tailored to their temporal characteristics to further increase the classification accuracy of neuromorphic datasets, which is verified through rigorous ablation experiments.

The management of large quantities of time series data presents challenges in terms of deep learning tasks, particularly for training a deep neural network. Recently, a technique named \textit{Dataset Condensation} has emerged as a solution to this problem. This technique generates a smaller synthetic dataset that has comparable performance to the full real dataset in downstream tasks such as classification. However, previous methods are primarily designed for image and graph datasets, and directly adapting them to the time series dataset leads to suboptimal performance due to their inability to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in time series data, particularly in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dataset \textit{\textbf{Cond}}ensation for \textit{\textbf{T}}ime \textit{\textbf{S}}eries \textit{\textbf{C}}lassification via Dual Domain Matching (\textbf{CondTSC}) which focuses on the time series classification dataset condensation task. Different from previous methods, our proposed framework aims to generate a condensed dataset that matches the surrogate objectives in both the time and frequency domains. Specifically, CondTSC incorporates multi-view data augmentation, dual domain training, and dual surrogate objectives to enhance the dataset condensation process in the time and frequency domains.

Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small two-layer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture. This study underscores the potential of RFI detection as a benchmark problem for SNN researchers, emphasizing the efficacy of SNNs in addressing complex time-series segmentation tasks in radio astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Set Features for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14773v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes to use set features for detecting anomalies in samples that consist of unusual combinations of normal elements. Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> |

We assume the network is generated from a latent variable model, and these unobserved variables are included in a structural peer effect model or a time series network autoregressive model as additive effects. This approach takes a unified view of two related problems, (1) modeling and predicting multivariate time series data and (2) causal peer influence estimation in the presence of homophily from finite time longitudinal data. Our estimation strategy comprises estimating latent factors from the observed network adjacency matrix either through spectral embedding or maximum likelihood estimation, followed by least squares estimation of the network autoregressive model. We show that the estimated momentum and peer effect parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal in asymptotic setups with a growing number of network vertices N while including a growing number of time points T and finite T cases. We allow the number of latent vectors K to grow at appropriate rates, which improves upon existing rates when such results are available for related models.</p></details> |  |

Our focus was particularly on scenarios in which unknown triggers causing the occurrence of events may consist of non-consecutive, masked, noisy data points. This scenario is akin to an agent tasked with learning to predict and explain the occurrence of events without understanding the underlying processes or having access to crucial information. Such scenarios are encountered across various fields, such as genomics, hardware and software verification, and financial time series prediction. We combined analytical, simulation, and machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate, quantify, and provide solutions to this challenge. We deduced and validated equations generally applicable to any variation of the underlying challenge. Using these equations, we (1) described how the level of complexity changes with various parameters (e.g., number of apparent and hidden states, trigger length, confidence, etc.) and (2) quantified the data needed to successfully train an ML model. We then (3) proved our ML solution learns and subsequently identifies unknown triggers and predicts the occurrence of events. If the complexity of the challenge is too high, our ML solution can identify trigger candidates to be used to interactively probe the system under investigation to determine the true trigger in a way considerably more efficient than brute force methods. By sharing our findings, we aim to assist others grappling with similar challenges, enabling estimates on the complexity of their problem, the data required and a solution to solve it.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Load Forecasting Under Data Scarcity in Smart Grids: A Meta-Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05887v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid expansion of smart grids and large volumes of data at the individual consumer level, there are still various cases where adequate data collection to train accurate load forecasting models is challenging or even impossible. This paper proposes adapting an established model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm for short-term load forecasting in the context of few-shot learning. Specifically, the proposed method can rapidly adapt and generalize within any unknown load time series of arbitrary length using only minimal training samples. In this context, the meta-learning model learns an optimal set of initial parameters for a base-level learner recurrent neural network. The proposed model is evaluated using a dataset of historical load consumption data from real-world consumers. Despite the examined load series' short length, it produces accurate forecasts outperforming transfer learning and task-specific machine learning methods by $12.5\%$. To enhance robustness and fairness during model evaluation, a novel metric, mean average log percentage error, is proposed that alleviates the bias introduced by the commonly used MAPE metric. Finally, a series of studies to evaluate the model's robustness under different hyperparameters and time series lengths is also conducted, demonstrating that the proposed approach consistently outperforms all other models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Synthetic datasets have emerged to address these issues. This paradigm relies on generative AI models to generate unbiased, privacy-preserving data while maintaining fidelity to the original data. However, assessing the trustworthiness of synthetic datasets and models is a critical challenge. We introduce a holistic auditing framework that comprehensively evaluates synthetic datasets and AI models. It focuses on preventing bias and discrimination, ensures fidelity to the source data, assesses utility, robustness, and privacy preservation. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by auditing various generative models across diverse use cases like education, healthcare, banking, and human resources, spanning different data modalities such as tabular, time-series, vision, and natural language. This holistic assessment is essential for compliance with regulatory safeguards. We introduce a trustworthiness index to rank synthetic datasets based on their safeguards trade-offs. Furthermore, we present a trustworthiness-driven model selection and cross-validation process during training, exemplified with "TrustFormers" across various data types. This approach allows for controllable trustworthiness trade-offs in synthetic data creation. Our auditing framework fosters collaboration among stakeholders, including data scientists, governance experts, internal reviewers, external certifiers, and regulators. This transparent reporting should become a standard practice to prevent bias, discrimination, and privacy violations, ensuring compliance with policies and providing accountability, safety, and performance guarantees.</p></details> | submitted |

It progresses gradually, often remaining undiagnosed until advanced stages. Early detection is crucial to monitor atrophy and develop treatment strategies to prevent further vision impairment. Data-centric methods have enabled computer-aided algorithms for precise glaucoma diagnosis. In this study, we use deep learning models to identify complex disease traits and progression criteria, detecting subtle changes indicative of glaucoma. We explore the structure-function relationship in glaucoma progression and predict functional impairment from structural eye deterioration. We analyze statistical and machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques with optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for accurate progression prediction. Addressing challenges like age variability, data imbalances, and noisy labels, we develop novel semi-supervised time-series algorithms: 1. Weakly-Supervised Time-Series Learning: We create a CNN-LSTM model to encode spatiotemporal features from OCT scans. This approach uses age-related progression and positive-unlabeled data to establish robust pseudo-progression criteria, bypassing gold-standard labels. 2. Semi-Supervised Time-Series Learning: Using labels from Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) in a contrastive learning scheme, the CNN-LSTM architecture learns from potentially mislabeled data to improve prediction accuracy. Our methods outperform conventional and state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | Dissertation |

In resource-constrained hospital environments, a scalable and unified machine learning framework that improves previous forecast performances could improve hospital operations and save costs. We introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning from tabular, time-series, language, and vision data for supervised binary/multiclass classification, regression, and unsupervised clustering. It features a novel attention mechanism balancing self-exploitation (learning source-task), and cross-exploration (learning cross-tasks), and offers explainability through a proposed TIM score, shedding light on the dynamics of task learning interdependencies. M3H encompasses an unprecedented range of medical tasks and machine learning problem classes and consistently outperforms traditional single-task models by on average 11.6% across 40 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments, three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task. The modular design of the framework ensures its generalizability in data processing, task definition, and rapid model prototyping, making it production ready for both clinical and operational healthcare settings, especially those in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hinge-FM2I: An Approach using Image Inpainting for Interpolating Missing Data in Univariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06631v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasts are crucial for various applications, such as traffic management, electricity consumption, and healthcare. However, limitations in models and data quality can significantly impact forecasts accuracy. One common issue with data quality is the absence of data points, referred to as missing data. It is often caused by sensor malfunctions, equipment failures, or human errors. This paper proposes Hinge-FM2I, a novel method for handling missing data values in univariate time series data. Hinge-FM2I builds upon the strengths of the Forecasting Method by Image Inpainting (FM2I). FM2I has proven effective, but selecting the most accurate forecasts remain a challenge. To overcome this issue, we proposed a selection algorithm. Inspired by door hinges, Hinge-FM2I drops a data point either before or after the gap (left/right-hinge), then use FM2I for imputation, and then select the imputed gap based on the lowest error of the dropped data point. Hinge-FM2I was evaluated on a comprehensive sample composed of 1356 time series, extracted from the M3 competition benchmark dataset, with missing value rates ranging from 3.57\% to 28.57\%. Experimental results demonstrate that Hinge-FM2I significantly outperforms established methods such as, linear/spline interpolation, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and ARIMA. Notably, Hinge-FM2I achieves an average Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) score of 5.6\% for small gaps, and up to 10\% for larger ones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Hinge-FM2I as a promising new method for addressing missing values in univariate time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist Multimodal AI: A Review of Architectures, Challenges and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05496v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models are expected to be a critical component to future advances in artificial intelligence. This field is starting to grow rapidly with a surge of new design elements motivated by the success of foundation models in natural language processing (NLP) and vision. It is widely hoped that further extending the foundation models to multiple modalities (e.g., text, image, video, sensor, time series, graph, etc.) will ultimately lead to generalist multimodal models, i.e. one model across different data modalities and tasks. However, there is little research that systematically analyzes recent multimodal models (particularly the ones that work beyond text and vision) with respect to the underling architecture proposed. Therefore, this work provides a fresh perspective on generalist multimodal models (GMMs) via a novel architecture and training configuration specific taxonomy. This includes factors such as Unifiability, Modularity, and Adaptability that are pertinent and essential to the wide adoption and application of GMMs. The review further highlights key challenges and prospects for the field and guide the researchers into the new advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal Downsampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10634v3)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a set of synchronous time series, each associated with a sensor-point in space and characterized by inter-series relationships, the problem of spatiotemporal forecasting consists of predicting future observations for each point. Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions, particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[A case study of spatiotemporal forecasting techniques for weather forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14782v2)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of real-world processes are spatiotemporal, and the data generated by them exhibits both spatial and temporal evolution. Weather is one of the most essential processes in this domain, and weather forecasting has become a crucial part of our daily routine. Weather data analysis is considered the most complex and challenging task. Although numerical weather prediction models are currently state-of-the-art, they are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Numerous studies have proposed time series-based models as a viable alternative to numerical forecasts. Recent research in the area of time series analysis indicates significant advancements, particularly regarding the use of state-space-based models (white box) and, more recently, the integration of machine learning and deep neural network-based models (black box). The most famous examples of such models are RNNs and transformers. These models have demonstrated remarkable results in the field of time-series analysis and have demonstrated effectiveness in modelling temporal correlations. It is crucial to capture both temporal and spatial correlations for a spatiotemporal process, as the values at nearby locations and time affect the values of a spatiotemporal process at a specific point. This self-contained paper explores various regional data-driven weather forecasting methods, i.e., forecasting over multiple latitude-longitude points (matrix-shaped spatial grid) to capture spatiotemporal correlations. The results showed that spatiotemporal prediction models reduced computational costs while improving accuracy. In particular, the proposed tensor train dynamic mode decomposition-based forecasting model has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art models without the need for training. We provide convincing numerical experiments to show that the proposed approach is practical.</p></details> |  |

This different scenario brings new challenges, particularly in terms of data ingestion, where existing technologies struggle to handle such massive time-series data, leading to low loading speed and poor timeliness. To address these challenges, this paper presents MatrixGate, a new and efficient data ingestion approach for massive time-series data. MatrixGate implements both single-instance and multi-instance parallel procedures, which is based on its unique ingestion strategies. First, MatrixGate uses policies to tune the slots that are synchronized with segments to ingest data, which eliminates the cost of starting transactions and enhance the efficiency. Second, multi-coroutines are responsible for transfer data, which can increase the degree of parallelism significantly. Third, lock-free queues are used to enable direct data transfer without the need for disk storage or lodging in the master instance. Experiment results on multiple datasets show that MatrixGate outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3 to 100 times in loading speed, and cuts down about 80% query latency. Furthermore, MatrixGate scales out efficiently under distributed architecture, achieving scalability of 86%.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use the Transformer decoder as a conditional quantile estimator to predict the quantiles of prediction residuals, which are used to estimate the prediction interval. We hypothesize that the Transformer decoder benefits the estimation of the prediction interval by learning temporal dependencies across past prediction residuals. Our comprehensive experiments using simulated and real data empirically demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art conformal prediction methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[C-Mamba: Channel Correlation Enhanced State Space Models for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05316v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made in multivariate time series forecasting using Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models. However, these approaches face notable limitations: linear forecasters struggle with representation capacities, attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, and convolutional models have a restricted receptive field. These constraints impede their effectiveness in modeling complex time series, particularly those with numerous variables. Additionally, many models adopt the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy, treating multivariate time series as uncorrelated univariate series while ignoring their correlations. For models considering inter-channel relationships, whether through the self-attention mechanism, linear combination, or convolution, they all incur high computational costs and focus solely on weighted summation relationships, neglecting potential proportional relationships between channels. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the newly introduced state space model and propose \textbf{C-Mamba}, a novel approach that captures cross-channel dependencies while maintaining linear complexity without losing the global receptive field. Our model consists of two key components: (i) channel mixup, where two channels are mixed to enhance the training sets; (ii) channel attention enhanced patch-wise Mamba encoder that leverages the ability of the state space models to capture cross-time dependencies and models correlations between channels by mining their weight relationships. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven real-world time series datasets. Moreover, the proposed mixup and attention strategy exhibits strong generalizability across other frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version. 40 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[A First Physical-World Trajectory Prediction Attack via LiDAR-induced Deceptions in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11707v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction forecasts nearby agents' moves based on their historical trajectories. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Existing attacks compromise the prediction model of a victim AV by directly manipulating the historical trajectory of an attacker AV, which has limited real-world applicability. This paper, for the first time, explores an indirect attack approach that induces prediction errors via attacks against the perception module of a victim AV. Although it has been shown that physically realizable attacks against LiDAR-based perception are possible by placing a few objects at strategic locations, it is still an open challenge to find an object location from the vast search space in order to launch effective attacks against prediction under varying victim AV velocities. Through analysis, we observe that a prediction model is prone to an attack focusing on a single point in the scene. Consequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework to realize the single-point attack. The first stage of prediction-side attack efficiently identifies, guided by the distribution of detection results under object-based attacks against perception, the state perturbations for the prediction model that are effective and velocity-insensitive. In the second stage of location matching, we match the feasible object locations with the found state perturbations. Our evaluation using a public autonomous driving dataset shows that our attack causes a collision rate of up to 63% and various hazardous responses of the victim AV. The effectiveness of our attack is also demonstrated on a real testbed car. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first security analysis spanning from LiDAR-based perception to prediction in autonomous driving, leading to a realistic attack on prediction. To counteract the proposed attack, potential defenses are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium 2024</p></details> |

This approach addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting by leveraging the generation of trajectories from previously encountered tasks to augment the current dataset. However, existing deep generative replay methods for continual learning rely on autoregressive models, which suffer from compounding errors in the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose a simple, scalable, and non-autoregressive method for continual learning in decision-making tasks using a generative model that generates task samples conditioned on the trajectory timestep. We evaluate our method on Continual World benchmarks and find that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the average success rate metric among continual learning methods.

| **[Fundamental dynamics of popularity-similarity trajectories in real networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01675v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real networks are complex dynamical systems, evolving over time with the addition and deletion of nodes and links. Currently, there exists no principled mathematical theory for their dynamics -- a grand-challenge open problem. Here, we show that the popularity and similarity trajectories of nodes in hyperbolic embeddings of different real networks manifest universal self-similar properties with typical Hurst exponents $H \ll 0.5$. This means that the trajectories are predictable, displaying anti-persistent or 'mean-reverting' behavior, and they can be adequately captured by a fractional Brownian motion process. The observed behavior can be qualitatively reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not in networks that lack such space, suggesting that the observed subdiffusive dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks. These results set the foundations for rigorous mathematical machinery for describing and predicting real network dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[IKLink: End-Effector Trajectory Tracking with Minimal Reconfigurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16154v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications require a robot to accurately track reference end-effector trajectories. Certain trajectories may not be tracked as single, continuous paths due to the robot's kinematic constraints or obstacles elsewhere in the environment. In this situation, it becomes necessary to divide the trajectory into shorter segments. Each such division introduces a reconfiguration, in which the robot deviates from the reference trajectory, repositions itself in configuration space, and then resumes task execution. The occurrence of reconfigurations should be minimized because they increase the time and energy usage. In this paper, we present IKLink, a method for finding joint motions to track reference end-effector trajectories while executing minimal reconfigurations. Our graph-based method generates a diverse set of Inverse Kinematics (IK) solutions for every waypoint on the reference trajectory and utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal motion by linking the IK solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IKLink through a simulation experiment and an illustrative demonstration using a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a contributed paper at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline. This approach enhances efficient GPS data preparation and facilitates a deeper understanding of cycling behavior and the cycling environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

This task is even more difficult in a dynamic environment, e.g., objects are moving. This paper presents a \emph{modular} zero-shot framework for language-driven manipulation of (dynamic) objects through a closed-loop control system with real-time trajectory replanning and an online 6D object pose localization. We segment an object within $\SI{0.5}{\second}$ by leveraging a vision language model via language commands. Then, guided by natural language commands, a closed-loop system, including a unified pose estimation and tracking and online trajectory planning, is utilized to continuously track this object and compute the optimal trajectory in real-time. Our proposed zero-shot framework provides a smooth trajectory that avoids jerky movements and ensures the robot can grasp a non-stationary object. Experiment results exhibit the real-time capability of the proposed zero-shot modular framework for the trajectory optimization module to accurately and efficiently grasp moving objects, i.e., up to \SI{30}{\hertz} update rates for the online 6D pose localization module and \SI{10}{\hertz} update rates for the receding-horizon trajectory optimization. These advantages highlight the modular framework's potential applications in robotics and human-robot interaction; see the video in https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/6e64/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.</p></details> |  |

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeTra: A Unified Model for Object Detection and Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04426v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tasks of object detection and trajectory forecasting play a crucial role in understanding the scene for autonomous driving. These tasks are typically executed in a cascading manner, making them prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, there is usually a very thin interface between the two tasks, creating a lossy information bottleneck. To address these challenges, our approach formulates the union of the two tasks as a trajectory refinement problem, where the first pose is the detection (current time), and the subsequent poses are the waypoints of the multiple forecasts (future time). To tackle this unified task, we design a refinement transformer that infers the presence, pose, and multi-modal future behaviors of objects directly from LiDAR point clouds and high-definition maps. We call this model DeTra, short for object Detection and Trajectory forecasting.

| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Scenarios Based on Graph Neural Network and Numerical Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08855v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In unstructured environments, obstacles are diverse and lack lane markings, making trajectory planning for intelligent vehicles a challenging task. Traditional trajectory planning methods typically involve multiple stages, including path planning, speed planning, and trajectory optimization. These methods require the manual design of numerous parameters for each stage, resulting in significant workload and computational burden. While end-to-end trajectory planning methods are simple and efficient, they often fail to ensure that the trajectory meets vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints in unstructured scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and numerical optimization. The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) initial trajectory prediction using the GNN, (2) trajectory optimization using numerical optimization. First, the graph neural network processes the environment information and predicts a rough trajectory, replacing traditional path and speed planning. This predicted trajectory serves as the initial solution for the numerical optimization stage, which optimizes the trajectory to ensure compliance with vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints. We conducted simulation experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and compared it with other mainstream planning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed method simplifies the trajectory planning process and significantly improves planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory optimization of tail-sitter considering speed constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tail-sitters combine the advantages of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vertical take-off and landing UAVs, and have been widely designed and researched in recent years. With the change in modern UAV application scenarios, it is required that UAVs have fast maneuverable three-dimensional flight capabilities. Due to the highly nonlinear aerodynamics produced by the fuselage and wings of the tail-sitter, how to quickly generate a smooth and executable trajectory is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. We constrain the speed of the tail-sitter, eliminate the differential dynamics constraints in the trajectory generation process of the tail-sitter through differential flatness, and allocate the time variable of the trajectory through the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method named MINCO. Because we discretize the trajectory in time, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint, thereby achieving the time-optimal trajectory for the tail-sitter to fly through any given waypoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Video Segmenter by Tracking Objects Along Axial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18537v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video segmentation requires consistently segmenting and tracking objects over time. Due to the quadratic dependency on input size, directly applying self-attention to video segmentation with high-resolution input features poses significant challenges, often leading to insufficient GPU memory capacity. Consequently, modern video segmenters either extend an image segmenter without incorporating any temporal attention or resort to window space-time attention in a naive manner. In this work, we present Axial-VS, a general and simple framework that enhances video segmenters by tracking objects along axial trajectories. The framework tackles video segmentation through two sub-tasks: short-term within-clip segmentation and long-term cross-clip tracking. In the first step, Axial-VS augments an off-the-shelf clip-level video segmenter with the proposed axial-trajectory attention, sequentially tracking objects along the height- and width-trajectories within a clip, thereby enhancing temporal consistency by capturing motion trajectories. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense features, and outperforms the window space-time attention in segmentation quality. In the second step, we further employ axial-trajectory attention to the object queries in clip-level segmenters, which are learned to encode object information, thereby aiding object tracking across different clips and achieving consistent segmentation throughout the video. Without bells and whistles, Axial-VS showcases state-of-the-art results on video segmentation benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in addressing the limitations of modern clip-level video segmenters.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs. cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalized Pointing Error Model for FSO Links with Fixed-Wing UAVs for 6G: Analysis and Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05444v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-space optical (FSO) communication is a promising solution to support wireless backhaul links in emerging 6G non-terrestrial networks. At the link level, pointing errors in FSO links can significantly impact capacity, making accurate modeling of these errors essential for both assessing and enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for FSO pointing errors in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that incorporates three-dimensional (3D) jitter, including roll, pitch, and yaw angle jittering. We derive a probability density function for the pointing error angle based on the relative position and posture of the UAV to the ground station. This model is then integrated into a trajectory optimization problem designed to maximize energy efficiency while meeting constraints on speed, acceleration, and elevation angle. Our proposed optimization method significantly improves energy efficiency by adjusting the UAV's flight trajectory to minimize exposure to directions highly affected by jitter. The simulation results emphasize the importance of using UAV-specific 3D jitter models in achieving accurate performance measurements and effective system optimization in FSO communication networks. Utilizing our generalized model, the optimized trajectories achieve up to 11.8 percent higher energy efficiency compared to those derived from conventional Gaussian pointing error models.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under revision; IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning at V2I-enabled Intersections based on Correlated Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05336v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating trajectories that ensure both vehicle safety and improve traffic efficiency remains a challenging task at intersections. Many existing works utilize Nash equilibrium (NE) for the trajectory planning at intersections. However, NE-based planning can hardly guarantee that all vehicles are in the same equilibrium, leading to a risk of collision. In this work, we propose a framework for trajectory planning based on Correlated Equilibrium (CE) when V2I communication is also enabled. The recommendation with CE allows all vehicles to reach a safe and consensual equilibrium and meanwhile keeps the rationality as NE-based methods that no vehicle has the incentive to deviate. The Intersection Manager (IM) first collects the trajectory library and the personal preference probabilities over the library from each vehicle in a low-resolution spatial-temporal grid map. Then, the IM optimizes the recommendation probability distribution for each vehicle's trajectory by minimizing overall collision probability under the CE constraint. Finally, each vehicle samples a trajectory of the low-resolution map to construct a safety corridor and derive a smooth trajectory with a local refinement optimization. We conduct comparative experiments at a crossroad intersection involving two and four vehicles, validating the effectiveness of our method in balancing vehicle safety and traffic efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,12 figures,Submission to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

When the generalization error of the SDE approximation closely aligns with that of SGD in expectation, it provides two opportunities for understanding better the generalization behaviour of SGD through its SDE approximation. Firstly, viewing SGD as full-batch gradient descent with Gaussian gradient noise allows us to obtain trajectory-based generalization bound using the information-theoretic bound from Xu and Raginsky [2017]. Secondly, assuming mild conditions, we estimate the steady-state weight distribution of SDE and use information-theoretic bounds from Xu and Raginsky [2017] and Negrea et al. [2019] to establish terminal-state-based generalization bounds. Our proposed bounds have some advantages, notably the trajectory-based bound outperforms results in Wang and Mao [2022], and the terminal-state-based bound exhibits a fast decay rate comparable to stability-based bounds.</p></details> | Accepted by UAI 2024 |

While LSO excels in single-objective optimization, its multi-objective variants face challenges such as poor initialization, local optima entrapment, and so on. This study proposes Dynamic Multi-Objective Lion Swarm Optimization with Multi-strategy Fusion (MF-DMOLSO) to address these limitations. MF-DMOLSO comprises three key components: initialization, swarm position update, and external archive update. The initialization unit employs chaotic mapping for uniform population distribution. The position update unit enhances behavior patterns and step size formulas for cub lions, incorporating crowding degree sorting, Pareto non-dominated sorting, and Levy flight to improve convergence speed and global search capabilities. Reference points guide convergence in higher-dimensional spaces, maintaining population diversity. An adaptive cold-hot start strategy generates a population responsive to environmental changes. The external archive update unit re-evaluates solutions based on non-domination and diversity to form the new population. Evaluations on benchmark functions showed MF-DMOLSO surpassed multi-objective particle swarm optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and multi-objective lion swarm optimization, exceeding 90% accuracy for two-objective and 97% for three-objective problems. Compared to non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III, MF-DMOLSO showed a 60% improvement. Applied to 6R robot trajectory planning, MF-DMOLSO optimized running time and maximum acceleration to 8.3s and 0.3pi rad/s^2, achieving a set coverage rate of 70.97% compared to 2% by multi-objective particle swarm optimization, thus improving efficiency and reducing mechanical dither.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v3)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |

However, the difficulty of collecting human demonstration data for complex tasks makes learning efficient representations of those trajectories challenging. For many problems, such as for dexterous manipulation, the exact timings of the trajectories should be factored from their spatial path characteristics. In this work, we propose TimewarpVAE, a fully differentiable manifold-learning algorithm that incorporates Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to simultaneously learn both timing variations and latent factors of spatial variation. We show how the TimewarpVAE algorithm learns appropriate time alignments and meaningful representations of spatial variations in handwriting and fork manipulation datasets. Our results have lower spatial reconstruction test error than baseline approaches and the learned low-dimensional representations can be used to efficiently generate semantically meaningful novel trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm to generate novel high-speed trajectories for a robotic arm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artif...</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS): Theory, Algorithms, and Applications Workshop at IJCAI '24</p></details> |

Prior work overcomes this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the learned distribution to facilitate online RL. However, since the offline data are given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult to generalize to new tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff). This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods. The key strength of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of RL methods. Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements in complicated settings.

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN, and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness.

In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

At the same time, the reference trajectory is unknown and generated from a reference system with unknown or partially known dynamics. We assume the only measurements that are available are the position and orientation of the multi-rotor and the position of the reference system. We adopt an extended high-gain observer (EHGO) estimation framework to estimate the unmeasured multi-rotor states, modeling errors, external disturbances, and the reference trajectory. We design a robust output feedback controller for trajectory tracking that comprises a feedback linearizing controller and the EHGO. The proposed control method is rigorously analyzed to establish its stability properties.

Machine learning-based trajectory prediction models do not require expert knowledge, but rely on the implicit knowledge extracted from massive amounts of data. Several deep learning (DL) methods for vessel trajectory prediction have recently been suggested. The DL models developed typically only process information about the (dis)location of vessels defined with respect to a global reference system. In the context of inland navigation, this can be problematic, since without knowledge of the limited navigable space, irrealistic trajectories are likely to be determined. If spatial constraintes are introduced, e.g., by implementing an additional submodule to process map data, however, overall complexity increases. Instead of processing the vessel displacement information on the one hand and the spatial information on the other hand, the paper proposes the merging of both information. Here, fairway-related and navigation-related displacement information are used directly. In this way, the previously proposed context-sensitive Classification Transformer (CSCT) shows an improved spatial awareness. Additionally, the CSCT is adapted to assess the model uncertainty by enabling dropout during inference. This approach is trained on different inland waterways to analyze its generalizability. As the improved CSCT obtains lower prediction errors and enables to estimate the trustworthiness of each prediction, it is more suitable for safety-critical applications in inland navigation than previously developed models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Short-term Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Encoder-Decoder Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02770v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is necessary for save and efficient navigation. Deep learning-based prediction models, esp. encoder-decoders, are rarely applied to inland navigation specifically. Approaches from the maritime domain cannot directly be transferred to river navigation due to specific driving behavior influencing factors. Different encoder-decoder architectures, including a transformer encoder-decoder, are compared herein for predicting the next positions of inland vessels, given not only spatio-temporal information from AIS, but also river specific features. The results show that the reformulation of the regression task as classification problem and the inclusion of river specific features yield the lowest displacement errors. The standard LSTM encoder-decoder outperforms the transformer encoder-decoder for the data considered, but is computationally more expensive. In this study for the first time a transformer-based encoder-decoder model is applied to the problem of predicting the ship trajectory. Here, a feature vector using the river-specific context of navigation input parameters is established. Future studies can built on the proposed models, investigate the improvement of the computationally more efficient transformer, e.g. through further hyper-parameter optimization, and use additional river-specific information in the context representation to further increase prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and social situation-aware transformer-based trajectory prediction of autonomous systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02767v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous transportation systems such as road vehicles or vessels require the consideration of the static and dynamic environment to dislocate without collision. Anticipating the behavior of an agent in a given situation is required to adequately react to it in time. Developing deep learning-based models has become the dominant approach to motion prediction recently. The social environment is often considered through a CNN-LSTM-based sub-module processing a $\textit{social tensor}$ that includes information of the past trajectory of surrounding agents. For the proposed transformer-based trajectory prediction model, an alternative, computationally more efficient social tensor definition and processing is suggested. It considers the interdependencies between target and surrounding agents at each time step directly instead of relying on information of last hidden LSTM states of individually processed agents. A transformer-based sub-module, the Social Tensor Transformer, is integrated into the overall prediction model. It is responsible for enriching the target agent's dislocation features with social interaction information obtained from the social tensor. For the awareness of spatial limitations, dislocation features are defined in relation to the navigable area. This replaces additional, computationally expensive map processing sub-modules. An ablation study shows, that for longer prediction horizons, the deviation of the predicted trajectory from the ground truth is lower compared to a spatially and socially agnostic model. Even if the performance gain from a spatial-only to a spatial and social context-sensitive model is small in terms of common error measures, by visualizing the results it can be shown that the proposed model in fact is able to predict reactions to surrounding agents and explicitely allows an interpretable behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Emotional Trajectories in Written Stories Utilizing Transformers and Weakly-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02251v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telling stories is an integral part of human communication which can evoke emotions and influence the affective states of the audience. Automatically modeling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal labels for an existing dataset of children's stories originally annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the categorical labels to the continuous valence and arousal space. For predicting the thus obtained emotionality signals, we fine-tune a DeBERTa model and improve upon this baseline via a weakly supervised learning approach. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of $.8221$ for valence and $.7125$ for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach. A detailed analysis shows the extent to which the results vary depending on factors such as the author, the individual story, or the section within the story. In addition, we uncover the weaknesses of our approach by investigating examples that prove to be difficult to predict.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.11382</p></details> |

The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In this work, we investigate cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by jointly designing three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and user scheduling. Considering the UAV's onboard energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated in which the average achievable rate of the considered system is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory, transmission power, and user scheduling. Due to the non-convex optimization problem, a lower bound on the average achievable rate is utilized to reduce the complexity of the solution. Subsequently, the original optimization problem is decoupled into four subproblems by using block coordinate descent, and each subproblem is transformed into manageable convex optimization problems by introducing slack variables and successive convex approximation. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the 3D trajectories of UAVs can enhance the average achievable rate of aerial CRNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures,submitted to the IEEE journal for review</p></details> |
| **[Constraint-Aware Diffusion Models for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00990v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion model has shown success in generating high-quality and diverse solutions to trajectory optimization problems. However, diffusion models with neural networks inevitably make prediction errors, which leads to constraint violations such as unmet goals or collisions. This paper presents a novel constraint-aware diffusion model for trajectory optimization. We introduce a novel hybrid loss function for training that minimizes the constraint violation of diffusion samples compared to the groundtruth while recovering the original data distribution. Our model is demonstrated on tabletop manipulation and two-car reach-avoid problems, outperforming traditional diffusion models in minimizing constraint violations while generating samples close to locally optimal solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCF: Cross Correcting Framework for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00749v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting future pedestrian trajectories is crucial across various domains. Due to the uncertainty in future pedestrian trajectories, it is important to learn complex spatio-temporal representations in multi-agent scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Correction Framework (CCF) to learn spatio-temporal representations of pedestrian trajectories better. Our framework consists of two trajectory prediction models, known as subnets, which share the same architecture and are trained with both cross-correction loss and trajectory prediction loss. Cross-correction leverages the learning from both subnets and enables them to refine their underlying representations of trajectories through a mutual correction mechanism. Specifically, we use the cross-correction loss to learn how to correct each other through an inter-subnet interaction. To induce diverse learning among the subnets, we use the transformed observed trajectories produced by a neural network as input to one subnet and the original observed trajectories as input to the other subnet. We utilize transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for each subnet to capture motion and social interaction among pedestrians. The encoder of the transformer captures motion patterns in trajectories, while the decoder focuses on pedestrian interactions with neighbors. Each subnet performs the primary task of predicting future trajectories (a regression task) along with the secondary task of classifying the predicted trajectories (a classification task). Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and SDD demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, CCF, in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. We also conducted several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various modules and loss functions used in our approach.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[An Efficient Trajectory Generation for Bi-copter Flight in Tight Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00671v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike squared (or alike) quadrotors, elongated bi-copters leverage natural superiority in crossing tight spaces. To date, extensive works have focused on the design, modeling, and control of bi-copters. Besides, a proper motion planner utilizing bi-copters' shape characteristics is essential to efficiently and safely traverse tight spaces, yet it has rarely been studied. Current motion planning methods will significantly compromise their ability to traverse narrow spaces if the map is inflated based on the long dimension of the bi-copter. In this paper, we propose an efficient motion planning method that enables the safe navigation of bi-copters through narrow spaces. We first adapt a dynamic, feasible path-finding algorithm with whole-body collision checks to generate a collision-free path. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the position and rotation of the bi-copter to produce a trajectory that is safe, dynamically feasible, and smooth. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have been conducted to verify the reliability and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |
| **[Learning to Approximate Particle Smoothing Trajectories via Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00561v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical systems from sparse observations is critical in numerous fields, including biology, finance, and physics. Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Stabilize Unknown LTI Systems on a Single Trajectory under Stochastic Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00234v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.</p></details> |  |

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

| **[Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Structure-Aware Lane Graph Transformer Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20121v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories for surrounding vehicles is vital for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes a Lane Graph Transformer (LGT) model with structure-aware capabilities. Its key contribution lies in encoding the map topology structure into the attention mechanism. To address variations in lane information from different directions, four Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) matrices are introduced to capture the local details of the map topology structure. Additionally, two Shortest Path Distance (SPD) matrices are employed to capture distance information between two accessible lanes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed LGT model achieves a significantly higher prediction performance on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Specifically, the minFDE$_6$ metric was decreased by 60.73% compared to the Argoverse 2 baseline model (Nearest Neighbor) and the b-minFDE$_6$ metric was reduced by 2.65% compared to the baseline LaneGCN model. Furthermore, ablation experiments demonstrated that the consideration of map topology structure led to a 4.24% drop in the b-minFDE$_6$ metric, validating the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Human Mobility: Inferring Semantics of Trajectories with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19850v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human mobility patterns is essential for various applications, from urban planning to public safety. The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns. This study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing the semantic analysis of trajectory data, paving the way for more sophisticated and accessible human mobility research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on three real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is instrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We rigorously evaluate our method by providing convergence guarantees and testing it on simulated cell data characterized by bifurcations and merges, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories, but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> |  |

Projecting Autonomous System Trajectories Into Naturalistic Behavior Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19292v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents operating around human actors must consider how their behaviors might affect those humans, even when not directly interacting with them. To this end, it is often beneficial to be predictable and appear naturalistic. Existing methods to address this problem use human actor intent modeling or imitation learning techniques, but these approaches rarely capture all possible motivations for human behavior or require significant amounts of data. In contrast, we propose a technique for modeling naturalistic behavior as a set of convex hulls computed over a relatively small dataset of human behavior. Given this set, we design an optimization-based filter which projects arbitrary trajectories into it to make them more naturalistic for autonomous agents to execute while also satisfying dynamics constraints. We demonstrate our methods on real-world human driving data from the inD intersection dataset (Bock et al., 2020).</p></details> |  |

DiPPeST achieves 92% success rate in obstacle avoidance for nominal environments and an average of 88% success rate when tested in environments that are up to 3.5 times more complex in pixel variation than DiPPeR. A visual-servoing framework is developed to allow for real-world execution, tested on the quadruped robot, achieving 80% success rate in different environments and showcasing improved behavior than complex state-of-the-art local planners, in narrow environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[WTTFNet: A Weather-Time-Trajectory Fusion Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in Urban Complex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18945v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory modelling in an urban complex is challenging because pedestrians can have many possible destinations, such as shops, escalators, and attractions. Moreover, weather and time-of-day may affect pedestrian behavior. In this paper, a new weather-time-trajectory fusion network (WTTFNet) is proposed to improve the performance of baseline deep neural network architecture. By incorporating weather and time-of-day information as an embedding structure, a novel WTTFNet based on gate multimodal unit is used to fuse the multimodal information and deep representation of trajectories. A joint loss function based on focal loss is used to co-optimize both the deep trajectory features and final classifier, which helps to improve the accuracy in predicting the intended destination of pedestrians and hence the trajectories under possible scenarios of class imbalances. Experimental results using the Osaka Asia and Pacific Trade Center (ATC) dataset shows improved performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art algorithms by 23.67% increase in classification accuracy, 9.16% and 7.07% reduction of average and final displacement error. The proposed approach may serve as an attractive approach for improving existing baseline trajectory prediction models when they are applied to scenarios with influences of weather-time conditions. It can be employed in numerous applications such as pedestrian facility engineering, public space development and technology-driven retail.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

This paper addresses the near danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off the common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models and ensure safety, but doing so introduces numerical approximation error conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach avoid methods in near-danger goal reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis reduces sample size requirements and expedites time-to-efficacy signals in advanced cancer clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02529v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis is limited to single unidirectional endpoints, most advanced cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered for either progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Movement: Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17680v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model.

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames. The code of this paper will also be open-sourced at: https://github.com/wsakobe/EF-Calib.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons as athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both the average performance level of the population, $g(t)$, at age $t$ and how each $i$-th athlete differs from the average $f_i(t)$. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into changes from season-to-season, termed the between-season performance trajectory, and within-season performance trajectories which are modelled by a constrained Bernstein polynomial. Hence, the specific focus of this project is to identify the differences in performance that exist both between and within-seasons for each athlete. For the implementation of the model an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is used. An illustration of algorithm's performance on 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming in both female and male athletes is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Learning in Offline RL with Linear $q^π$-Realizability and Concentrability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16809v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

We utilize OpenCV's CSRT algorithm to accurately track the baseball and fixed reference points in 2D video frames. These tracked pixel coordinates are then used as input features for our neural network model, which comprises multiple fully connected layers to map the 2D coordinates to 3D space. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trajectories using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, optimizing the network to minimize prediction errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves high accuracy in reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D inputs. This method shows great potential for applications in sports analysis, coaching, and enhancing the accuracy of trajectory predictions in various sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v2)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of trajectory data in terms of volume, density, and inter-person interactions, limits relevant studies from being comprehensive and interactive. We mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia and tackle the generalization problem stemming from the variety and heterogeneity of the trajectory descriptions. Our ensemble model COSMOS, which combines the idea of semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning, achieves an F1 score of 85.95%. For this task, we also create a hand-curated dataset, WikiLifeTrajectory, consisting of 8,852 (person, time, location) triplets as ground truth. Besides, we perform an empirical analysis on the trajectories of 8,272 historians to demonstrate the validity of the extracted results. To facilitate the research on trajectory extractions and help the analytical studies to construct grand narratives, we make our code, the million-level extracted trajectories, and the WikiLifeTrajectory dataset publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review. 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Delving into the Trajectory Long-tail Distribution for Muti-object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04700v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical area within computer vision, with a broad spectrum of practical implementations. Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

| **[Trajectory-Based Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for Model Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model ensures the drivability of the predicted trajectory by integrating non-holonomic motion constraints and physical constraints into the generative prediction module. Central to the architecture of cVMD is its capacity to perform uncertainty quantification, a feature that is crucial in safety-critical applications. By integrating the quantified uncertainty into the prediction process, the cVMD's trajectory prediction performance is improved considerably. The model's performance was evaluated using the publicly available highD dataset.

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |

Most existing work utilizes a tailored cross-attention mechanism to perform local alignment across the two image and text modalities. This is computationally expensive, even though it is more powerful than the unimodal dual-encoder approach. This work introduces a dual-encoder image-text matching model, leveraging a scene graph to represent captions with nodes for objects and attributes interconnected by relational edges. Utilizing a graph attention network, our model efficiently encodes object-attribute and object-object semantic relations, resulting in a robust and fast-performing system. Representing caption as a scene graph offers the ability to utilize the strong relational inductive bias of graph neural networks to learn object-attribute and object-object relations effectively. To train the model, we propose losses that align the image and caption both at the holistic level (image-caption) and the local level (image-object entity), which we show is key to the success of the model. Our model is termed Composition model for Object Relations and Attributes, CORA. Experimental results on two prominent image-text retrieval benchmarks, Flickr30K and MSCOCO, demonstrate that CORA outperforms existing state-of-the-art computationally expensive cross-attention methods regarding recall score while achieving fast computation speed of the dual encoder.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR'24 |
| **[Graph Neural Re-Ranking via Corpus Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11720v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Re-ranking systems aim to reorder an initial list of documents to satisfy better the information needs associated with a user-provided query. Modern re-rankers predominantly rely on neural network models, which have proven highly effective in representing samples from various modalities. However, these models typically evaluate query-document pairs in isolation, neglecting the underlying document distribution that could enhance the quality of the re-ranked list. To address this limitation, we propose Graph Neural Re-Ranking (GNRR), a pipeline based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), that enables each query to consider documents distribution during inference. Our approach models document relationships through corpus subgraphs and encodes their representations using GNNs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GNNs effectively capture cross-document interactions, improving performance on popular ranking metrics. In TREC-DL19, we observe a relative improvement of 5.8% in Average Precision compared to our baseline. These findings suggest that integrating the GNN segment offers significant advantages, especially in scenarios where understanding the broader context of documents is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint is the result of work in progress, therefore it should still be considered a draft</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Expressiveness through Preprocessed Graph Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11714v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant method for analyzing graph-structured data. However, canonical GNNs have limited expressive power and generalization capability, thus triggering the development of more expressive yet computationally intensive methods. One such approach is to create a series of perturbed versions of input graphs and then repeatedly conduct multiple message-passing operations on all variations during training. Despite their expressive power, this approach does not scale well on larger graphs. To address this scalability issue, we introduce Scalable Expressiveness through Preprocessed Graph Perturbation (SE2P). This model offers a flexible, configurable balance between scalability and generalizability with four distinct configuration classes. At one extreme, the configuration prioritizes scalability through minimal learnable feature extraction and extensive preprocessing; at the other extreme, it enhances generalizability with more learnable feature extractions, though this increases scalability costs. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the generalizability and scalability of SE2P variants compared to various state-of-the-art benchmarks. Our results indicate that, depending on the chosen SE2P configuration, the model can enhance generalizability compared to benchmarks while achieving significant speed improvements of up to 8-fold.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

Traditional methods often employ graph neural networks (GNNs) with predefined graphs to describe spatial correlations among traffic nodes in urban road networks. However, these pre-defined graphs are limited by existing knowledge and graph generation methodologies, offering an incomplete picture of spatial correlations. While time-varying graphs based on data-driven learning have attempted to address these limitations, they still struggle with adequately capturing the inherent spatial correlations in traffic data. Moreover, most current methods for capturing dynamic temporal correlations rely on a unified calculation scheme using a temporal multi-head self-attention mechanism, which at some level might leads to inaccuracies. In order to overcome these challenges, we have proposed a novel hybrid time-varying graph neural network (HTVGNN) for traffic flow prediction. Firstly, a novel enhanced temporal perception multi-head self-attention mechanism based on time-varying mask enhancement was reported to more accurately model the dynamic temporal dependencies among distinct traffic nodes in the traffic network. Secondly, we have proposed a novel graph learning strategy to concurrently learn both static and dynamic spatial associations between different traffic nodes in road networks. Meanwhile, in order to enhance the learning ability of time-varying graphs, a coupled graph learning mechanism was designed to couple the graphs learned at each time step. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method HTVGNN was demonstrated with four real data sets. Simulation results revealed that HTVGNN achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to the state of the art spatio-temporal graph neural network models. Additionally, the ablation experiment verifies that the coupled graph learning mechanism can effectively improve the long-term prediction performance of HTVGNN.</p></details> | 16 pages,7 figures |

Fidelity has been widely used due to its straightforward interpretation that the underlying model should produce similar predictions when features deemed unimportant from the explanation are removed. This raises a natural question: "Does fidelity induce a global (soft) mask for graph pruning?" To solve this, we aim to explore the potential of the fidelity measure to be used for graph pruning, eventually enhancing the GNN models for better efficiency. To this end, we propose Fidelity$^-$-inspired Pruning (FiP), an effective framework to construct global edge masks from local explanations. Our empirical observations using 7 edge attribution methods demonstrate that, surprisingly, general eXplainable AI methods outperform methods tailored to GNNs in terms of graph pruning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables; IJCAI Workshop on Explainable AI (XAI 2024) (to appear) (Please cite our workshop version.)</p></details> |

Optimizing communication becomes imperative, and the compilation and mapping of quantum circuits onto physical qubits must minimize state transfers while adhering to architectural constraints. The compilation process, inherently an NP-hard problem, demands extensive search times even with a small number of qubits to be solved to optimality. To address this challenge efficiently, we advocate for the utilization of heuristic mappers that can rapidly generate solutions. In this work, we propose a novel approach employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to learn these heuristics for a specific multi-core architecture. Our DRL agent incorporates a Transformer encoder and Graph Neural Networks. It encodes quantum circuits using self-attention mechanisms and produce outputs through an attention-based pointer mechanism that directly signifies the probability of matching logical qubits with physical cores. This enables the selection of optimal cores for logical qubits efficiently. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method can outperform baseline approaches in terms of reducing inter-core communications and minimizing online time-to-solution. This research contributes to the advancement of scalable quantum computing systems by introducing a novel learning-based heuristic approach for efficient quantum circuit compilation and mapping.</p></details> |  |

While these methodologies have demonstrated effectiveness in classification tasks, their efficacy in regression applications, such as execution time prediction from source code, remains underexplored. This paper endeavours to decode the behaviour of tree-based neural network models in the context of such regression challenges. We extend the application of established models--tree-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Code2Vec, and Transformer-based methods--to predict the execution time of source code by parsing it to an AST. Our comparative analysis reveals that while these models are benchmarks in code representation, they exhibit limitations when tasked with regression. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel dual-transformer approach that operates on both source code tokens and AST representations, employing cross-attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability between the two domains. Furthermore, we explore the adaptation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to this tree-based problem, theorizing the inherent compatibility due to the graphical nature of ASTs. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets showcase that our dual-transformer model outperforms all other tree-based neural networks and the GNN-based models. Moreover, our proposed dual transformer demonstrates remarkable adaptability and robust performance across diverse datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This Paper is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</p></details> |

We further explore the usage of what we define as \textit{dredge words} on social media -- terms or phrases for which unreliable domains rank highly. Through comprehensive graph neural network ablations, we demonstrate that curriculum-based heterogeneous graph models that leverage context from both webgraphs and social media data outperform homogeneous and single-mode approaches. We further demonstrate that the incorporation of dredge words into our model strongly associates unreliable websites with social media and online commerce platforms. Finally, we show our heterogeneous model greatly outperforms competing systems in the top-k identification of unlabeled unreliable websites. We demonstrate the strong unreliability signals present in the diverse paths that users follow to uncover unreliable content, and we release a novel dataset of dredge words.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Topology-aware Data Augmentation for High-Degree Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05482v3)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a potent tool for learning on graph-structured data and won fruitful successes in varied fields. The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where representations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of its neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have dozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an efficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification. The former obtains augmented node features and enhanced model capacity by encoding the graph structure into high-quality structure embeddings with our highly-efficient sketching method. Further, by exploiting task-relevant features extracted from graph structures and attributes, the second module enables the accurate identification and reduction of numerous redundant/noisy edges from the input graph, thereby alleviating over-smoothing and facilitating faster feature aggregations over HDGs. Empirically, TADA considerably improves the predictive performance of mainstream GNN models on 8 real homophilic/heterophilic HDGs in terms of node classification, while achieving efficient training and inference processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report for the paper accepted to KDD 2024. 16 pages</p></details> |
| **[DeFiGuard: A Price Manipulation Detection Service in DeFi using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11157v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prosperity of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) unveils underlying risks, with reported losses surpassing 3.2 billion USD between 2018 and 2022 due to vulnerabilities in Decentralized Applications (DApps). One significant threat is the Price Manipulation Attack (PMA) that alters asset prices during transaction execution. As a result, PMA accounts for over 50 million USD in losses. To address the urgent need for efficient PMA detection, this paper introduces a novel detection service, DeFiGuard, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose cash flow graphs with four distinct features, which capture the trading behaviors from transactions. Moreover, DeFiGuard integrates transaction parsing, graph construction, model training, and PMA detection. Evaluations on a dataset of 208 PMA and 2,080 non-PMA transactions show that DeFiGuard with GNN models outperforms the baseline in Accuracy, TPR, FPR, and AUC-ROC. The results of ablation studies suggest that the combination of the four proposed node features enhances DeFiGuard's efficacy. Moreover, DeFiGuard classifies transactions within 0.892 to 5.317 seconds, which provides sufficient time for the victims (DApps and users) to take action to rescue their vulnerable funds. In conclusion, this research offers a significant step towards safeguarding the DeFi landscape from PMAs using GNNs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Global-Local Graph Neural Networks for Node-Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10863v1)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of graph node classification is often approached by utilizing a local Graph Neural Network (GNN), that learns only local information from the node input features and their adjacency. In this paper, we propose to improve the performance of node classification GNNs by utilizing both global and local information, specifically by learning label- and node- features. We therefore call our method Global-Local-GNN (GLGNN). To learn proper label features, for each label, we maximize the similarity between its features and nodes features that belong to the label, while maximizing the distance between nodes that do not belong to the considered label. We then use the learnt label features to predict the node classification map. We demonstrate our GLGNN using three different GNN backbones, and show that our approach improves baseline performance, revealing the importance of global information utilization for node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Pattern Recognition Letters (Submitted for review on 03/2023)</p></details> |

We formally formulate the problem as an instance of graph action bandit. We then propose \texttt{GNN-TS}, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) powered Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm which employs a GNN approximator for estimating the mean reward function and the graph neural tangent features for uncertainty estimation. We prove that, under certain boundness assumptions on the reward function, GNN-TS achieves a state-of-the-art regret bound which is (1) sub-linear of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\tilde{d} T)^{1/2})$ in the number of interaction rounds, $T$, and a notion of effective dimension $\tilde{d}$, and (2) independent of the number of graph nodes. Empirical results validate that our proposed \texttt{GNN-TS} exhibits competitive performance and scales well on graph action bandit problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[E-SAGE: Explainability-based Defense Against Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10655v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been widely adopted in multiple domains. Yet, they are notably vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. In particular, backdoor attacks based on subgraph insertion have been shown to be effective in graph classification tasks while being stealthy, successfully circumventing various existing defense methods. In this paper, we propose E-SAGE, a novel approach to defending GNN backdoor attacks based on explainability. We find that the malicious edges and benign edges have significant differences in the importance scores for explainability evaluation. Accordingly, E-SAGE adaptively applies an iterative edge pruning process on the graph based on the edge scores. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of E-SAGE against state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in different attack settings. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of E-SAGE against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseRadNet: Sparse Perception Neural Network on Subsampled Radar Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10600v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar-based perception has gained increasing attention in autonomous driving, yet the inherent sparsity of radars poses challenges. Radar raw data often contains excessive noise, whereas radar point clouds retain only limited information. In this work, we holistically treat the sparse nature of radar data by introducing an adaptive subsampling method together with a tailored network architecture that exploits the sparsity patterns to discover global and local dependencies in the radar signal. Our subsampling module selects a subset of pixels from range-doppler (RD) spectra that contribute most to the downstream perception tasks. To improve the feature extraction on sparse subsampled data, we propose a new way of applying graph neural networks on radar data and design a novel two-branch backbone to capture both global and local neighbor information. An attentive fusion module is applied to combine features from both branches. Experiments on the RADIal dataset show that our SparseRadNet exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in object detection and achieves close to SOTA accuracy in freespace segmentation, meanwhile using sparse subsampled input data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polytopal mesh agglomeration via geometrical deep learning for three-dimensional heterogeneous domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10587v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agglomeration techniques are important to reduce the computational costs of numerical simulations and stand at the basis of multilevel algebraic solvers. To automatically perform the agglomeration of polyhedral grids, we propose a novel Geometrical Deep Learning-based algorithm that can exploit the geometrical and physical information of the underlying computational domain to construct the agglomerated grid and simultaneously guarantee the agglomerated grid's quality. In particular, we propose a bisection model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to partition a suitable connectivity graph of computational three-dimensional meshes. The new approach has a high online inference speed and can simultaneously process the graph structure of the mesh, the geometrical information of the mesh (e.g. elements' volumes, centers' coordinates), and the physical information of the domain (e.g. physical parameters). Taking advantage of this new approach, our algorithm can agglomerate meshes of a domain composed of heterogeneous media in an automatic way. The proposed GNN techniques are compared with the k-means algorithm and METIS: standard approaches for graph partitioning that are meant to process only the connectivity information on the mesh. We demonstrate that the performance of our algorithms outperforms available approaches in terms of quality metrics and runtimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm also shows a good level of generalization when applied to more complex geometries, such as three-dimensional geometries reconstructed from medical images. Finally, the capabilities of the model in performing agglomeration of heterogeneous domains are tested in the framework of problems containing microstructures and on a complex geometry such as the human brain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Backdoor: Fundamentals, Methodologies, Applications, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10573v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced various downstream graph-relevant tasks, encompassing recommender systems, molecular structure prediction, social media analysis, etc. Despite the boosts of GNN, recent research has empirically demonstrated its potential vulnerability to backdoor attacks, wherein adversaries employ triggers to poison input samples, inducing GNN to adversary-premeditated malicious outputs. This is typically due to the controlled training process, or the deployment of untrusted models, such as delegating model training to third-party service, leveraging external training sets, and employing pre-trained models from online sources. Although there's an ongoing increase in research on GNN backdoors, comprehensive investigation into this field is lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose the first survey dedicated to GNN backdoors. We begin by outlining the fundamental definition of GNN, followed by the detailed summarization and categorization of current GNN backdoor attacks and defenses based on their technical characteristics and application scenarios. Subsequently, the analysis of the applicability and use cases of GNN backdoors is undertaken. Finally, the exploration of potential research directions of GNN backdoors is presented. This survey aims to explore the principles of graph backdoors, provide insights to defenders, and promote future security research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lift Your Molecules: Molecular Graph Generation in Latent Euclidean Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10513v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new framework for molecular graph generation with 3D molecular generative models. Our Synthetic Coordinate Embedding (SyCo) framework maps molecular graphs to Euclidean point clouds via synthetic conformer coordinates and learns the inverse map using an E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN). The induced point cloud-structured latent space is well-suited to apply existing 3D molecular generative models. This approach simplifies the graph generation problem - without relying on molecular fragments nor autoregressive decoding - into a point cloud generation problem followed by node and edge classification tasks. Further, we propose a novel similarity-constrained optimization scheme for 3D diffusion models based on inpainting and guidance. As a concrete implementation of our framework, we develop EDM-SyCo based on the E(3) Equivariant Diffusion Model (EDM). EDM-SyCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in distribution learning of molecular graphs, outperforming the best non-autoregressive methods by more than 30% on ZINC250K and 16% on the large-scale GuacaMol dataset while improving conditional generation by up to 3.9 times.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geodesic Distance Between Graphs: A Spectral Metric for Assessing the Stability of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10500v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a spectral framework for assessing the generalization and stability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing a Graph Geodesic Distance (GGD) metric. For two different graphs with the same number of nodes, our framework leverages a spectral graph matching procedure to find node correspondence so that the geodesic distance between them can be subsequently computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem associated with their Laplacian matrices. For graphs with different sizes, a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme is introduced to reduce the size of the bigger graph while preserving the original spectral properties. We show that the proposed GGD metric can effectively quantify dissimilarities between two graphs by encapsulating their differences in key structural (spectral) properties, such as effective resistances between nodes, cuts, the mixing time of random walks, etc. Through extensive experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art metrics, such as the latest Tree-Mover's Distance (TMD) metric, the proposed GGD metric shows significantly improved performance for stability evaluation of GNNs especially when only partial node features are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Graph Selective Prompt Learning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10498v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompt learning/tuning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained models for graph representation learning. As a kind of universal graph prompt learning method, Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) has achieved remarkable success in adapting pre-trained models for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By fixing the parameters of a pre-trained GNN model, the aim of GPF is to modify the input graph data by adding some (learnable) prompt vectors into graph node features to better align with the downstream tasks on the smaller dataset. However, existing GPFs generally suffer from two main limitations. First, GPFs generally focus on node prompt learning which ignore the prompting for graph edges. Second, existing GPFs generally conduct the prompt learning on all nodes equally which fails to capture the importances of different nodes and may perform sensitively w.r.t noisy nodes in aligning with the downstream tasks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new unified Graph Selective Prompt Feature learning (GSPF) for GNN fine-tuning. The proposed GSPF integrates the prompt learning on both graph node and edge together, which thus provides a unified prompt model for the graph data. Moreover, it conducts prompt learning selectively on nodes and edges by concentrating on the important nodes and edges for prompting which thus make our model be more reliable and compact. Experimental results on many benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSPF method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Event Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10492v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key elements of human events are extracted as quadruples that consist of subject, relation, object, and timestamp. This representation can be extended to a quintuple by adding a fifth element: a textual summary that briefly describes the event. These quadruples or quintuples, when organized within a specific domain, form a temporal knowledge graph (TKG). Current learning frameworks focus on a few TKG-related tasks, such as predicting an object given a subject and a relation or forecasting the occurrences of multiple types of events (i.e., relation) in the next time window. They typically rely on complex structural and sequential models like graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to update intermediate embeddings. However, these methods often neglect the contextual information inherent in each quintuple, which can be effectively captured through concise textual descriptions. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can streamline the design of TKG learning frameworks while maintaining competitive accuracy in prediction and forecasting tasks. We develop multiple prompt templates to frame the object prediction (OP) task as a standard question-answering (QA) task, suitable for instruction fine-tuning with an encoder-decoder generative LLM. For multi-event forecasting (MEF), we design simple yet effective prompt templates for each TKG quintuple. This novel approach removes the need for GNNs and RNNs, instead utilizing an encoder-only LLM to generate fixed intermediate embeddings, which are subsequently processed by a prediction head with a self-attention mechanism to forecast potential future relations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

However, many PINN-like methods are poorly scalable and are limited to in-sample scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel discrete approach termed Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (PIGNN) to solve forward and inverse nonlinear PDEs. In particular, our approach seamlessly integrates the strength of graph neural networks (GNN), physical equations and finite difference to approximate solutions of physical systems. Our approach is compared with the PINN baseline on three well-known nonlinear PDEs (heat, Burgers and FitzHugh-Nagumo). We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method to work with irregular meshes, longer time steps, arbitrary spatial resolutions, varying initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) by conducting extensive numerical experiments. Numerical results also illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, time extrapolability, generalizability and scalability. The main advantage of our approach is that models trained in small domains with simple settings have excellent fitting capabilities and can be directly applied to more complex situations in large domains.</p></details> |  |

Given a collection of observed temporal graphs, is it possible to predict the evolution of an unseen network from the same domain? To answer this question, we first present the Temporal Graph Scaling (TGS) dataset, a large collection of temporal graphs consisting of eighty-four ERC20 token transaction networks collected from 2017 to 2023. Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 15 figures, under review of NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We explore two widely utilized types of graph neural networks: graph convolutional neural networks and message passing graph neural networks. Prior to this study, existing bounds on the generalization error in the over-parametrized regime were uninformative, limiting our understanding of over-parameterized network performance. Our novel approach involves deriving upper bounds within the mean-field regime for evaluating the generalization error of these graph neural networks. We establish upper bounds with a convergence rate of $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of graph samples. These upper bounds offer a theoretical assurance of the networks' performance on unseen data in the challenging over-parameterized regime and overall contribute to our understanding of their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2024</p></details> |

Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

In this problem, each cache is only allowed to access measurements from a small subset of sensors within its vicinity to reduce both cache size and data acquisition overhead. To enable reliable data recovery with limited access to measurements, we propose a distributed sparse data recovery method, called the collaborative sparse recovery by anchor alignment (CoSR-AA) algorithm, where collaboration among caches is enabled by aligning their locally recovered data at a few anchor nodes. The proposed algorithm is based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm but with message exchange that is reduced by considering the proposed anchor alignment strategy. Then, by the deep unfolding of the ADMM iterations, we further propose the Deep CoSR-AA algorithm that can be used to significantly reduce the number of iterations. We obtain a graph neural network architecture where message exchange is done more efficiently by an embedded autoencoder. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative recovery algorithms in terms of the improved reconstruction quality and the reduced communication overhead due to anchor alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1 wa...</summary><p>v1 was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing on Sept. 18, 2023</p></details> |

Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency. The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation. 4) Training Stop Criteria. Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks. To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies. Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research. The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this limitation, we propose a two-step approach consisting of (1) generating rule functions from knowledge and (2) using these rules to define rule based layers -- a new type of dynamic neural network layer. The focus of this work is on the second step, i.e., rule based layers that are designed to dynamically arrange learnable parameters in the weight matrices and bias vectors depending on the input samples. Indeed, we prove that our approach generalizes classical feed-forward layers such as fully connected and convolutional layers by choosing appropriate rules. As a concrete application we present rule based graph neural networks (RuleGNNs) that overcome some limitations of ordinary graph neural networks. Our experiments show that the predictive performance of RuleGNNs is comparable to state-of-the-art graph classifiers using simple rules based on Weisfeiler-Leman labeling and pattern counting. Moreover, we introduce new synthetic benchmark graph datasets to show how to integrate expert knowledge into RuleGNNs making them more powerful than ordinary graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |

Despite their success in a wide range of graph mining tasks, GNNs have raised serious concerns regarding their trustworthiness, including susceptibility to distribution shift, biases towards certain populations, and lack of explainability. Recently, integrating causal learning techniques into GNNs has sparked numerous ground-breaking studies since many GNN trustworthiness issues can be alleviated by capturing the underlying data causality rather than superficial correlations. In this survey, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on Causality-Inspired GNNs (CIGNNs). Specifically, we first employ causal tools to analyze the primary trustworthiness risks of existing GNNs, underscoring the necessity for GNNs to comprehend the causal mechanisms within graph data. Moreover, we introduce a taxonomy of CIGNNs based on the type of causal learning capability they are equipped with, i.e., causal reasoning and causal representation learning. Besides, we systematically introduce typical methods within each category and discuss how they mitigate trustworthiness risks. Finally, we summarize useful resources and discuss several future directions, hoping to shed light on new research opportunities in this emerging field.

While traditional heuristics are grounded in graph topology, they encounter challenges in generalizing across diverse graphs. Recent research efforts have aimed to leverage the potential of heuristics, yet a unified formulation accommodating both local and global heuristics remains undiscovered. Drawing insights from the fact that both local and global heuristics can be represented by adjacency matrix multiplications, we propose a unified matrix formulation to accommodate and generalize various heuristics. We further propose the Heuristic Learning Graph Neural Network (HL-GNN) to efficiently implement the formulation. HL-GNN adopts intra-layer propagation and inter-layer connections, allowing it to reach a depth of around 20 layers with lower time complexity than GCN. Extensive experiments on the Planetoid, Amazon, and OGB datasets underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of HL-GNN. It outperforms existing methods by a large margin in prediction performance. Additionally, HL-GNN is several orders of magnitude faster than heuristic-inspired methods while requiring only a few trainable parameters. The case study further demonstrates that the generalized heuristics and learned weights are highly interpretable.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Inspired by the learning to explain (L2X) paradigm, we propose L2XGNN, a framework for explainable GNNs which provides faithful explanations by design. L2XGNN learns a mechanism for selecting explanatory subgraphs (motifs) which are exclusively used in the GNNs message-passing operations. L2XGNN is able to select, for each input graph, a subgraph with specific properties such as being sparse and connected. Imposing such constraints on the motifs often leads to more interpretable and effective explanations. Experiments on several datasets suggest that L2XGNN achieves the same classification accuracy as baseline methods using the entire input graph while ensuring that only the provided explanations are used to make predictions. Moreover, we show that L2XGNN is able to identify motifs responsible for the graph's properties it is intended to predict.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness-Inspired Defense Against Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09836v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising results in tasks such as node classification and graph classification. However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing a significant threat to their real-world adoption. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, there is no work on defending against various types of backdoor attacks where generated triggers have different properties. Hence, we first empirically verify that prediction variance under edge dropping is a crucial indicator for identifying poisoned nodes. With this observation, we propose using random edge dropping to detect backdoors and theoretically show that it can efficiently distinguish poisoned nodes from clean ones. Furthermore, we introduce a novel robust training strategy to efficiently counteract the impact of the triggers. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our framework can effectively identify poisoned nodes, significantly degrade the attack success rate, and maintain clean accuracy when defending against various types of graph backdoor attacks with different properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-Training Identification of Graph Winning Tickets in Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08287v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel method to significantly enhance the computational efficiency of Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ASTGNNs) by introducing the concept of the Graph Winning Ticket (GWT), derived from the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH). By adopting a pre-determined star topology as a GWT prior to training, we balance edge reduction with efficient information propagation, reducing computational demands while maintaining high model performance. Both the time and memory computational complexity of generating adaptive spatial-temporal graphs is significantly reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Our approach streamlines the ASTGNN deployment by eliminating the need for exhaustive training, pruning, and retraining cycles, and demonstrates empirically across various datasets that it is possible to achieve comparable performance to full models with substantially lower computational costs. Specifically, our approach enables training ASTGNNs on the largest scale spatial-temporal dataset using a single A6000 equipped with 48 GB of memory, overcoming the out-of-memory issue encountered during original training and even achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we delve into the effectiveness of the GWT from the perspective of spectral graph theory, providing substantial theoretical support. This advancement not only proves the existence of efficient sub-networks within ASTGNNs but also broadens the applicability of the LTH in resource-constrained settings, marking a significant step forward in the field of graph neural networks.

However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks. The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository on Github, accessible at https://github.com/Zhuofeng-Li/TEG-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Spectral Graph Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Study on Effectiveness and Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09675v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), spectral GNNs have received increasing popularity by virtue of their specialty in capturing graph signals in the frequency domain, demonstrating promising capability in specific tasks. However, few systematic studies have been conducted on assessing their spectral characteristics. This emerging family of models also varies in terms of designs and settings, leading to difficulties in comparing their performance and deciding on the suitable model for specific scenarios, especially for large-scale tasks. In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the frequency perspective. We analyze and categorize over 30 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters. Then, we implement these spectral models under a unified framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. Thorough experiments are conducted on the spectral models with inclusive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering practical guidelines on evaluating and selecting spectral GNNs with desirable performance. Our implementation enables application on larger graphs with comparable performance and less overhead, which is available at: https://github.com/gdmnl/Spectral-GNN-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Complex Multi-step Attacks with Explainable Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11335v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex multi-step attacks have caused significant damage to numerous critical infrastructures. To detect such attacks, graph neural network based methods have shown promising results by modeling the system's events as a graph. However, existing methods still face several challenges when deployed in practice. First, there is a lack of sufficient real attack data especially considering the large volume of normal data. Second, the modeling of event graphs is challenging due to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature. Third, the lack of explanation in learning models undermines the trustworthiness of such methods in production environments. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose an attack detection method, Trace2Vec. The approach first designs an erosion function to augment rare attack samples, and integrates them into the event graphs. Next, it models the event graphs via a continuous-time dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network. Finally, it employs the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to identify events with greater contributions to the attack, thus enhancing the explainability of the detection result. We have implemented a prototype for Trace2Vec, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its superior detection and explanation performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author: Peng Gao (gao.itslab@gmail.com)</p></details> |

Recently, graph-based bot detection methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, our research finds many isolated and poorly linked nodes in social networks, as shown in Fig.1, which graph-based methods cannot effectively detect. To address this problem, our research focuses on effectively utilizing node semantics and network structure to jointly detect sparsely linked nodes. Given the excellent performance of language models (LMs) in natural language understanding (NLU), we propose a novel social bot detection framework LGB, which consists of two main components: language model (LM) and graph neural network (GNN). Specifically, the social account information is first extracted into unified user textual sequences, which is then used to perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the language model to improve its ability to understand social account semantics. Next, the semantically enriched node representation is fed into the pre-trained GNN to further enhance the node representation by aggregating information from neighbors. Finally, LGB fuses the information from both modalities to improve the detection performance of sparsely linked nodes. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LGB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models by up to 10.95%. LGB is already online: https://botdetection.aminer.cn/robotmain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Bayes Estimators for Irregular Spatial Data using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02600v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Bayes estimators are neural networks that approximate Bayes estimators in a fast and likelihood-free manner. Although they are appealing to use with spatial models, where estimation is often a computational bottleneck, neural Bayes estimators in spatial applications have, to date, been restricted to data collected over a regular grid. These estimators are also currently dependent on a prescribed set of spatial locations, which means that the neural network needs to be re-trained for new data sets; this renders them impractical in many applications and impedes their widespread adoption. In this work, we employ graph neural networks to tackle the important problem of parameter point estimation from data collected over arbitrary spatial locations. In addition to extending neural Bayes estimation to irregular spatial data, our architecture leads to substantial computational benefits, since the estimator can be used with any configuration or number of locations and independent replicates, thus amortising the cost of training for a given spatial model. We also facilitate fast uncertainty quantification by training an accompanying neural Bayes estimator that approximates a set of marginal posterior quantiles. We illustrate our methodology on Gaussian and max-stable processes. Finally, we showcase our methodology on a data set of global sea-surface temperature, where we estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process model in 2161 spatial regions, each containing thousands of irregularly-spaced data points, in just a few minutes with a single graphics processing unit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Molecular Concept Generation and Labeling with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09612v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly transforming scientific research. Explainable AI methods, such as concept-based models (CMs), are promising for driving new scientific discoveries because they make predictions based on meaningful concepts and offer insights into the prediction process. In molecular science, however, explainable CMs are not as common compared to black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), primarily due to their requirement for predefined concepts and manual label for each instance, which demand domain knowledge and can be labor-intensive. This paper introduces a novel framework for Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) generation and labeling. AutoMolCo leverages the knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate predictive molecular concepts and label them for each molecule. Such procedures are repeated through iterative interactions with LLMs to refine concepts, enabling simple linear models on the refined concepts to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The whole AutoMolCo framework is automated without any human knowledge inputs in either concept generation, labeling, or refinement, thereby surpassing the limitations of extant CMs while maintaining their explainability and allowing easy intervention. Through systematic experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets, we demonstrate that the AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial and promising for molecular science research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Reasoning about Knowledge Graphs with Region-based Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09529v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for knowledge graph (KG) completion need to capture semantic regularities and use these regularities to infer plausible knowledge that is not explicitly stated. Most embedding-based methods are opaque in the kinds of regularities they can capture, although region-based KG embedding models have emerged as a more transparent alternative. By modeling relations as geometric regions in high-dimensional vector spaces, such models can explicitly capture semantic regularities in terms of the spatial arrangement of these regions. Unfortunately, existing region-based approaches are severely limited in the kinds of rules they can capture. We argue that this limitation arises because the considered regions are defined as the Cartesian product of two-dimensional regions. As an alternative, in this paper, we propose RESHUFFLE, a simple model based on ordering constraints that can faithfully capture a much larger class of rule bases than existing approaches. Moreover, the embeddings in our framework can be learned by a monotonic Graph Neural Network (GNN), which effectively acts as a differentiable rule base. This approach has the important advantage that embeddings can be easily updated as new knowledge is added to the KG. At the same time, since the resulting representations can be used similarly to standard KG embeddings, our approach is significantly more efficient than existing approaches to differentiable reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We strengthen this result by proving that connectedness can still be determined when the subgraphs in the deck are given up to equivalence under the color refinement isomorphism test. Consequently, this implies that connectedness is recognizable by Reconstruction Graph Neural Networks, a recently introduced GNN architecture inspired by the reconstruction conjecture (Cotta, Morris, Ribeiro 2021).</p></details> | 9 pages |

The architecture integrates Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Learnable Random Walk Positional Encodings (LRWPE), enhancing the model's ability to understand complex molecular structures and their relationship with their respective docking scores. This approach significantly surpasses traditional HTVS methods and recent Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in both recovery and efficiency due to a wider coverage of the chemical space and enhanced performance. Our results demonstrate that ScoreFormer achieves competitive performance in docking score prediction and offers a substantial 1.65-fold reduction in inference time compared to existing models. We evaluated ScoreFormer across multiple datasets under various conditions, confirming its robustness and reliability in identifying potential drug candidates rapidly.</p></details> |  |

Pre-training Transformers on massive text datasets from the Internet has led to unmatched generalization for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. However, such language models remain fragile when tasked with algorithmic forms of reasoning, where computations must be precise and robust. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that combines the Transformer's language understanding with the robustness of graph neural network (GNN)-based neural algorithmic reasoners (NARs). Such NARs proved effective as generic solvers for algorithmic tasks, when specified in graph form. To make their embeddings accessible to a Transformer, we propose a hybrid architecture with a two-phase training procedure, allowing the tokens in the language model to cross-attend to the node embeddings from the NAR. We evaluate our resulting TransNAR model on CLRS-Text, the text-based version of the CLRS-30 benchmark, and demonstrate significant gains over Transformer-only models for algorithmic reasoning, both in and out of distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at CVPR 2024 Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning (MAR) Workshop. 10 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

They have shown impressive performance on several tasks, but their complexity limits applications to larger graphs. Previous approaches suggested processing only subsets of subgraphs, selected either randomly or via learnable sampling. However, they make suboptimal subgraph selections or can only cope with very small subset sizes, inevitably incurring performance degradation. This paper introduces a new Subgraph GNNs framework to address these issues. We employ a graph coarsening function to cluster nodes into super-nodes with induced connectivity. The product between the coarsened and the original graph reveals an implicit structure whereby subgraphs are associated with specific sets of nodes. By running generalized message-passing on such graph product, our method effectively implements an efficient, yet powerful Subgraph GNN. Controlling the coarsening function enables meaningful selection of any number of subgraphs while, contrary to previous methods, being fully compatible with standard training techniques. Notably, we discover that the resulting node feature tensor exhibits new, unexplored permutation symmetries. We leverage this structure, characterize the associated linear equivariant layers and incorporate them into the layers of our Subgraph GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple graph learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, as it can seamlessly handle any number of subgraphs, while consistently outperforming baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

However, existing methods, including deep learning methods, heavily rely on sequence-aware information, and do not fully leverage the potential of available 3D structural information. In addition, these methods may exhibit an inability to predict mutations in domains difficult to formulate sequence-based embeddings. In this study, we introduce a novel rationale-guided graph neural network AlphaGMut to evaluate mutation effects and to distinguish pathogenic mutations from neutral mutations. We compute the alpha shapes of protein structures to obtain atomic-resolution edge connectivities and map them to an accurate residue-level graph representation. We then compute structural-, topological-, biophysical-, and sequence properties of the mutation sites, which are assigned as node attributes in the graph. These node attributes could effectively guide the graph neural network to learn the difference between pathogenic and neutral mutations using k-hop message passing with a short training period. We demonstrate that AlphaGMut outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including DeepMind's AlphaMissense, in many performance metrics. In addition, AlphaGMut has the advantage of performing well in alignment-free settings, which provides broader prediction coverage and better generalization compared to current methods requiring deep sequence-aware information.</p></details> | 2 figures, 2 tables |

In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis to reevaluate the performance of three classic GNN models (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE) against GTs. Our findings suggest that the previously reported superiority of GTs may have been overstated due to suboptimal hyperparameter configurations in GNNs. Remarkably, with slight hyperparameter tuning, these classic GNN models achieve state-of-the-art performance, matching or even exceeding that of recent GTs across 17 out of the 18 diverse datasets examined. Additionally, we conduct detailed ablation studies to investigate the influence of various GNN configurations, such as normalization, dropout, residual connections, network depth, and jumping knowledge mode, on node classification performance. Our study aims to promote a higher standard of empirical rigor in the field of graph machine learning, encouraging more accurate comparisons and evaluations of model capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Tree Containment asks whether the given phylogenetic tree (for instance, constructed from a DNA fragment showing tree-like evolution) is contained in the given phylogenetic network. In the general case, this is an NP-complete problem. We propose to solve it approximately using Graph Neural Networks. In particular, we propose to combine the given network and the tree and apply a Graph Neural Network to this network-tree graph. This way, we achieve the capability of solving the tree containment instances representing a larger number of species than the instances contained in the training dataset (i.e., our algorithm has the inductive learning ability). Our algorithm demonstrates an accuracy of over $95\%$ in solving the tree containment problem on instances with up to 100 leaves.</p></details> |  |

Efficiently reusing these parts is key to reducing design and production costs for enterprises. Retrieval systems are vital for achieving CAD reuse, but the complex shapes of CAD models are difficult to accurately describe using text or keywords, making traditional retrieval methods ineffective. While existing representation learning approaches have been developed for CAD, manually labeling similar samples in these methods is expensive. Additionally, CAD models' unique parameterized data structure presents challenges for applying existing 3D shape representation learning techniques directly. In this work, we propose GC-CAD, a self-supervised contrastive graph neural network-based method for mechanical CAD retrieval that directly models parameterized CAD raw files. GC-CAD consists of two key modules: structure-aware representation learning and contrastive graph learning framework. The method leverages graph neural networks to extract both geometric and topological information from CAD models, generating feature representations. We then introduce a simple yet effective contrastive graph learning framework approach, enabling the model to train without manual labels and generate retrieval-ready representations. Experimental results on four datasets including human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements and up to 100 times efficiency improvement over the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have seen the adoption of subgraph GNNs, which partition an input graph into numerous subgraphs, subsequently applying GNNs to each to augment the graph's overall representation. Despite their ability to identify various substructures, subgraph GNNs are hindered by significant computational and memory costs. In this paper, we tackle a critical question: Is it possible for GNNs to count substructures both \textbf{efficiently} and \textbf{provably}? Our approach begins with a theoretical demonstration that the distance to rooted nodes in subgraphs is key to boosting the counting power of subgraph GNNs. To avoid the need for repetitively applying GNN across all subgraphs, we introduce precomputed structural embeddings that encapsulate this crucial distance information. Experiments validate that our proposed model retains the counting power of subgraph GNNs while achieving significantly faster performance.</p></details> | accepted in KDD 2024 |

Traditional trajectory planning methods typically involve multiple stages, including path planning, speed planning, and trajectory optimization. These methods require the manual design of numerous parameters for each stage, resulting in significant workload and computational burden. While end-to-end trajectory planning methods are simple and efficient, they often fail to ensure that the trajectory meets vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints in unstructured scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and numerical optimization. The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) initial trajectory prediction using the GNN, (2) trajectory optimization using numerical optimization. First, the graph neural network processes the environment information and predicts a rough trajectory, replacing traditional path and speed planning. This predicted trajectory serves as the initial solution for the numerical optimization stage, which optimizes the trajectory to ensure compliance with vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints. We conducted simulation experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and compared it with other mainstream planning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed method simplifies the trajectory planning process and significantly improves planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional GNNs, EFI-GNN is a multilayer linear network designed to model arbitrary-order feature interactions explicitly within graphs. To validate the efficacy of EFI-GNN, we conduct experiments using various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EFI-GNN has competitive performance with existing GNNs, and when a GNN is jointly trained with EFI-GNN, predictive performance sees an improvement. Furthermore, the predictions made by EFI-GNN are interpretable, owing to its linear construction.

Advances in jet tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in high-energy physics experiments.

A proposed mitigating strategy involves the direct integration of rules or relationships corresponding to the graph data into the model. However, within the domain of graph representation learning, the inherent complexity of graph data obstructs the derivation of a comprehensive causal structure that encapsulates universal rules or relationships governing the entire dataset. Instead, only specialized diminutive causal structures, delineating specific causal relationships within constrained subsets of graph data, emerge as discernible. Motivated by empirical insights, it is observed that GNN models exhibit a tendency to converge towards such specialized causal structures during the training process. Consequently, we posit that the introduction of these specific causal structures is advantageous for the training of GNN models. Building upon this proposition, we introduce a novel method that enables GNN models to glean insights from these specialized diminutive causal structures, thereby enhancing overall performance. Our method specifically extracts causal knowledge from the model representation of these diminutive causal structures and incorporates interchange intervention to optimize the learning process. Theoretical analysis serves to corroborate the efficacy of our proposed method. Furthermore, empirical experiments consistently demonstrate significant performance improvements across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

This may not be feasible from a single base pose and the robot must plan the sequence of base poses for grasping all objects, minimizing the total navigation and grasping time. This is a Combinatorial Optimization problem that can be solved using exact methods, which provide optimal solutions but are computationally expensive, or approximate methods, which offer computationally efficient but sub-optimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that learning-based methods can solve Combinatorial Optimization problems, providing near-optimal and computationally efficient solutions. In this work, we present BASENET - a learning-based approach to plan the sequence of base poses for the robot to grasp all the objects in the scene. We propose a Reinforcement Learning based solution that learns the base poses for grasping individual objects and the sequence in which the objects should be grasped to minimize the total navigation and grasping costs using Layered Learning. As the problem has a varying number of states and actions, we represent states and actions as a graph and use Graph Neural Networks for learning. We show that the proposed method can produce comparable solutions to exact and approximate methods with significantly less computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

While structure-based methods accurately model physical interactions between a drug and its protein target, cell-based assays such as Cell Painting can better capture complex DTI interactions. This paper introduces MOTI$\mathcal{VE}$, a Morphological cOmpound Target Interaction Graph dataset that comprises Cell Painting features for $11,000$ genes and $3,600$ compounds along with their relationships extracted from seven publicly available databases. We provide random, cold-source (new drugs), and cold-target (new genes) data splits to enable rigorous evaluation under realistic use cases. Our benchmark results show that graph neural networks that use Cell Painting features consistently outperform those that learn from graph structure alone, feature-based models, and topological heuristics. MOTI$\mathcal{VE}$ accelerates both graph ML research and drug discovery by promoting the development of more reliable DTI prediction models.

| **[Graph Condensation for Open-World Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17003v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning volume of graph data presents significant computational challenges in training graph neural networks (GNNs), critically impeding their efficiency in various applications. To tackle this challenge, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising acceleration solution, focusing on the synthesis of a compact yet representative graph for efficiently training GNNs while retaining performance. Despite the potential to promote scalable use of GNNs, existing GC methods are limited to aligning the condensed graph with merely the observed static graph distribution. This limitation significantly restricts the generalization capacity of condensed graphs, particularly in adapting to dynamic distribution changes. In real-world scenarios, however, graphs are dynamic and constantly evolving, with new nodes and edges being continually integrated. Consequently, due to the limited generalization capacity of condensed graphs, applications that employ GC for efficient GNN training end up with sub-optimal GNNs when confronted with evolving graph structures and distributions in dynamic real-world situations. To overcome this issue, we propose open-world graph condensation (OpenGC), a robust GC framework that integrates structure-aware distribution shift to simulate evolving graph patterns and exploit the temporal environments for invariance condensation. This approach is designed to extract temporal invariant patterns from the original graph, thereby enhancing the generalization capabilities of the condensed graph and, subsequently, the GNNs trained on it. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic evolving graphs demonstrate that OpenGC outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) GC methods in adapting to dynamic changes in open-world graph environments.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

However, for these approaches, there exists no theoretic expressivity study. In this work, we propose the Fragment-WL test, an extension to the well-known Weisfeiler & Leman (WL) test, which enables the theoretic analysis of these fragment-biased GNNs. Building on the insights gained from the Fragment-WL test, we develop a new GNN architecture and a fragmentation with infinite vocabulary that significantly boosts expressiveness. We show the effectiveness of our model on synthetic and real-world data where we outperform all GNNs on Peptides and have 12% lower error than all GNNs on ZINC and 34% lower error than other fragment-biased models. Furthermore, we show that our model exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to the latest transformer-based architectures, positioning it as a robust solution for a range of molecular modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the development of high-quality, diverse datasets for structural analysis still needs to be improved. Although traditional datasets, such as simulated jet engine bracket dataset, are useful, they are constrained by a small number of samples, which must be improved for developing robust data-driven surrogate models. This study presents the DeepJEB dataset, which has been created using deep generative models and automated engineering simulation pipelines, to overcome these challenges. Moreover, this study provides comprehensive 3D geometries and their corresponding structural analysis data. Key experiments validated the effectiveness of the DeepJEB dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in the prediction accuracy and reliability of surrogate models trained on this data. The enhanced dataset showed a broader design space and better generalization capabilities than traditional datasets. These findings highlight the potential of DeepJEB as a benchmark dataset for developing reliable surrogate models in structural engineering. The DeepJEB dataset supports advanced modeling techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and high-dimensional convolutional networks (CNNs), leveraging node-level field data for precise predictions. This dataset is set to drive innovation in engineering design applications, enabling more accurate and efficient structural performance predictions.

| **[Balancing Molecular Information and Empirical Data in the Prediction of Physico-Chemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08075v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, including 10 pages of main text and 2 pages of appendix</p></details> |
| **[Residual Connections and Normalization Can Provably Prevent Oversmoothing in GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02997v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Residual connections and normalization layers have become standard design choices for graph neural networks (GNNs), and were proposed as solutions to the mitigate the oversmoothing problem in GNNs. However, how exactly these methods help alleviate the oversmoothing problem from a theoretical perspective is not well understood. In this work, we provide a formal and precise characterization of (linearized) GNNs with residual connections and normalization layers. We establish that (a) for residual connections, the incorporation of the initial features at each layer can prevent the signal from becoming too smooth, and determines the subspace of possible node representations; (b) batch normalization prevents a complete collapse of the output embedding space to a one-dimensional subspace through the individual rescaling of each column of the feature matrix. This results in the convergence of node representations to the top-$k$ eigenspace of the message-passing operator; (c) moreover, we show that the centering step of a normalization layer -- which can be understood as a projection -- alters the graph signal in message-passing in such a way that relevant information can become harder to extract. We therefore introduce a novel, principled normalization layer called GraphNormv2 in which the centering step is learned such that it does not distort the original graph signal in an undesirable way. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Interpretable Are Interpretable Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07955v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable graph neural networks (XGNNs ) are widely adopted in various scientific applications involving graph-structured data. Existing XGNNs predominantly adopt the attention-based mechanism to learn edge or node importance for extracting and making predictions with the interpretable subgraph. However, the representational properties and limitations of these methods remain inadequately explored. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that formulates interpretable subgraph learning with the multilinear extension of the subgraph distribution, coined as subgraph multilinear extension (SubMT). Extracting the desired interpretable subgraph requires an accurate approximation of SubMT, yet we find that the existing XGNNs can have a huge gap in fitting SubMT. Consequently, the SubMT approximation failure will lead to the degenerated interpretability of the extracted subgraphs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new XGNN architecture called Graph Multilinear neT (GMT), which is provably more powerful in approximating SubMT. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that GMT outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 10% in terms of both interpretability and generalizability across 12 regular and geometric graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML2...</summary><p>ICML2024, 44 pages, 21 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Federated Incomplete Multi-View Clustering with Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08524v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated multi-view clustering offers the potential to develop a global clustering model using data distributed across multiple devices. However, current methods face challenges due to the absence of label information and the paramount importance of data privacy. A significant issue is the feature heterogeneity across multi-view data, which complicates the effective mining of complementary clustering information. Additionally, the inherent incompleteness of multi-view data in a distributed setting can further complicate the clustering process. To address these challenges, we introduce a federated incomplete multi-view clustering framework with heterogeneous graph neural networks (FIM-GNNs). In the proposed FIM-GNNs, autoencoders built on heterogeneous graph neural network models are employed for feature extraction of multi-view data at each client site. At the server level, heterogeneous features from overlapping samples of each client are aggregated into a global feature representation. Global pseudo-labels are generated at the server to enhance the handling of incomplete view data, where these labels serve as a guide for integrating and refining the clustering process across different data views. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on public benchmark datasets to verify the performance of the proposed FIM-GNNs in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAME-ON: Graph Attention Network based Multimodal Fusion for Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12478v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media in present times has a significant and growing influence. Fake news being spread on these platforms have a disruptive and damaging impact on our lives. Furthermore, as multimedia content improves the visibility of posts more than text data, it has been observed that often multimedia is being used for creating fake content. A plethora of previous multimodal-based work has tried to address the problem of modeling heterogeneous modalities in identifying fake content. However, these works have the following limitations: (1) inefficient encoding of inter-modal relations by utilizing a simple concatenation operator on the modalities at a later stage in a model, which might result in information loss; (2) training very deep neural networks with a disproportionate number of parameters on small but complex real-life multimodal datasets result in higher chances of overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose GAME-ON, a Graph Neural Network based end-to-end trainable framework that allows granular interactions within and across different modalities to learn more robust data representations for multimodal fake news detection. We use two publicly available fake news datasets, Twitter and Weibo, for evaluations. Our model outperforms on Twitter by an average of 11% and keeps competitive performance on Weibo, within a 2.6% margin, while using 65% fewer parameters than the best comparable state-of-the-art baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SNAM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Transductive Defense: a Two-Stage Defense for Graph Membership Inference Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07917v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become instrumental in diverse real-world applications, offering powerful graph learning capabilities for tasks such as social networks and medical data analysis. Despite their successes, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including membership inference attacks (MIA), which threaten privacy by identifying whether a record was part of the model's training data. While existing research has explored MIA in GNNs under graph inductive learning settings, the more common and challenging graph transductive learning setting remains understudied in this context. This paper addresses this gap and proposes an effective two-stage defense, Graph Transductive Defense (GTD), tailored to graph transductive learning characteristics. The gist of our approach is a combination of a train-test alternate training schedule and flattening strategy, which successfully reduces the difference between the training and testing loss distributions. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of our method (a decrease in attack AUROC by $9.42\%$ and an increase in utility performance by $18.08\%$ on average compared to LBP), highlighting its potential for seamless integration into various classification models with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design Your Own Universe: A Physics-Informed Agnostic Method for Enhancing Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14580v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed Graph Neural Networks have achieved remarkable performance in learning through graph-structured data by mitigating common GNN challenges such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and heterophily adaption. Despite these advancements, the development of a simple yet effective paradigm that appropriately integrates previous methods for handling all these challenges is still underway. In this paper, we draw an analogy between the propagation of GNNs and particle systems in physics, proposing a model-agnostic enhancement framework. This framework enriches the graph structure by introducing additional nodes and rewiring connections with both positive and negative weights, guided by node labeling information. We theoretically verify that GNNs enhanced through our approach can effectively circumvent the over-smoothing issue and exhibit robustness against over-squashing. Moreover, we conduct a spectral analysis on the rewired graph to demonstrate that the corresponding GNNs can fit both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Empirical validations on benchmarks for homophilic, heterophilic graphs, and long-term graph datasets show that GNNs enhanced by our method significantly outperform their original counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Current bioinformatic methods struggle to handle the heterogeneous nature of this data, especially with missing modalities. We propose PARADIGM, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that learns from multimodal, heterogeneous datasets to improve clinical outcome prediction. PARADIGM generates embeddings from multi-resolution data using foundation models, aggregates them into patient-level representations, fuses them into a unified graph, and enhances performance for tasks like survival analysis. We train GNNs on pan-Squamous Cell Carcinomas and validate our approach on Moffitt Cancer Center lung SCC data. Multimodal GNN outperforms other models in patient survival prediction. Converging individual data modalities across varying scales provides a more insightful disease view. Our solution aims to understand the patient's circumstances comprehensively, offering insights on heterogeneous data integration and the benefits of converging maximum data views.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods insufficiently address the removal of size information from graph representations, resulting in sub-optimal performance and reliance on backbone models. In response, we propose DISGEN, a novel and model-agnostic framework designed to disentangle size factors from graph representations. DISGEN employs size- and task-invariant augmentations and introduces a decoupling loss that minimizes shared information in hidden representations, with theoretical guarantees for its effectiveness. Our empirical results show that DISGEN outperforms the state-of-the-art models by up to 6% on real-world datasets, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing the size generalizability of GNNs.

| **[Graph Reasoning for Explainable Cold Start Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07420v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold start problem, where new users or items have no interaction history, remains a critical challenge in recommender systems (RS). A common solution involves using Knowledge Graphs (KG) to train entity embeddings or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Since KGs incorporate auxiliary data and not just user/item interactions, these methods can make relevant recommendations for cold users or items. Graph Reasoning (GR) methods, however, find paths from users to items to recommend using relations in the KG and, in the context of RS, have been used for interpretability. In this study, we propose GRECS: a framework for adapting GR to cold start recommendations. By utilizing explicit paths starting for users rather than relying only on entity embeddings, GRECS can find items corresponding to users' preferences by navigating the graph, even when limited information about users is available. Our experiments show that GRECS mitigates the cold start problem and outperforms competitive baselines across 5 standard datasets while being explainable. This study highlights the potential of GR for developing explainable recommender systems better suited for managing cold users and items.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the impact of noisy labels in graph classification: A utility and privacy perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07314v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks based on message-passing mechanisms have achieved advanced results in graph classification tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades when noisy labels are present in the training data. Most existing noisy labeling approaches focus on the visual domain or graph node classification tasks and analyze the impact of noisy labels only from a utility perspective. Unlike existing work, in this paper, we measure the effects of noise labels on graph classification from data privacy and model utility perspectives. We find that noise labels degrade the model's generalization performance and enhance the ability of membership inference attacks on graph data privacy. To this end, we propose the robust graph neural network approach with noisy labeled graph classification. Specifically, we first accurately filter the noisy samples by high-confidence samples and the first feature principal component vector of each class. Then, the robust principal component vectors and the model output under data augmentation are utilized to achieve noise label correction guided by dual spatial information. Finally, supervised graph contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the embedding quality of the model and protect the privacy of the training graph data. The utility and privacy of the proposed method are validated by comparing twelve different methods on eight real graph classification datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the RGLC method achieves at most and at least 7.8% and 0.8% performance gain at 30% noisy labeling rate, respectively, and reduces the accuracy of privacy attacks to below 60%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Mining under Data scarcity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04825v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multitude of deep learning models have been proposed for node classification in graphs. However, they tend to perform poorly under labeled-data scarcity. Although Few-shot learning for graphs has been introduced to overcome this problem, the existing models are not easily adaptable for generic graph learning frameworks like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our work proposes an Uncertainty Estimator framework that can be applied on top of any generic GNN backbone network (which are typically designed for supervised/semi-supervised node classification) to improve the node classification performance. A neural network is used to model the Uncertainty Estimator as a probability distribution rather than probabilistic discrete scalar values. We train these models under the classic episodic learning paradigm in the $n$-way, $k$-shot fashion, in an end-to-end setting. Our work demonstrates that implementation of the uncertainty estimator on a GNN backbone network improves the classification accuracy under Few-shot setting without any meta-learning specific architecture. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets under different Few-shot settings and different GNN-based backbone networks. Our method outperforms the baselines, which demonstrates the efficacy of the Uncertainty Estimator for Few-shot node classification on graphs with a GNN.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Large Language Model Meets Graph Neural Network in Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05894v4)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In service-oriented architectures, accurately predicting the Quality of Service (QoS) is crucial for maintaining reliability and enhancing user satisfaction. However, significant challenges remain due to existing methods always overlooking high-order latent collaborative relationships between users and services and failing to dynamically adjust feature learning for every specific user-service invocation, which are critical for learning accurate features. Additionally, reliance on RNNs for capturing QoS evolution hampers models' ability to detect long-term trends due to difficulties in managing long-range dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose the \underline{T}arget-Prompt \underline{O}nline \underline{G}raph \underline{C}ollaborative \underline{L}earning (TOGCL) framework for temporal-aware QoS prediction. TOGCL leverages a dynamic user-service invocation graph to model historical interactions, providing a comprehensive representation of user-service relationships. Building on this graph, it develops a target-prompt graph attention network to extract online deep latent features of users and services at each time slice, simultaneously considering implicit collaborative relationships between target users/services and their neighbors, as well as relevant historical QoS values. Additionally, a multi-layer Transformer encoder is employed to uncover temporal feature evolution patterns of users and services, leading to temporal-aware QoS prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on the WS-DREAM dataset demonstrate that our proposed TOGCL framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, achieving improvements of up to 38.80\%. These results underscore the effectiveness of the TOGCL framework for precise temporal QoS prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Hence, the reverse process of message passing can produce the distinguishable node representations by inverting the forward message propagation. The distinguishable representations can help us to better classify neighboring nodes with different labels, such as in heterophilic graphs. In this work, we apply the design principle of the reverse process to the three variants of the GNNs. Through the experiments on heterophilic graph data, where adjacent nodes need to have different representations for successful classification, we show that the reverse process significantly improves the prediction performance in many cases. Additional analysis reveals that the reverse mechanism can mitigate the over-smoothing over hundreds of layers.

However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms heavily relies on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum unit processing (QPU) whose topology is in form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding Problem. Existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when confronted with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm ensuring solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate that the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In details, CHARME yields superior solutions compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies correct biases mainly by employing handcrafted features or applying data-driven methods intuitively, overlooking the complicated dependencies between weather factors and between areas. To address this issue, we propose WeatherGNN, a local NWP bias-correction method that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to exploit meteorological dependencies and spatial dependencies under the guidance of domain knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a factor GNN to capture area-specific meteorological dependencies adaptively based on spatial heterogeneity and a fast hierarchical GNN to capture dynamic spatial dependencies efficiently guided by Tobler's first and second laws of geography. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that WeatherGNN achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline with an average of 4.75 \% on RMSE.</p></details> | IJCAI 2024 |

However, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" multisets and graphs might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. In this work, we propose to fully analyze the separation quality of multiset models and MPNNs via a novel adaptation of Lipschitz and H\"{o}lder continuity to parametric functions. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-H\"{o}lder continuous, with a H\"{o}lder exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth. Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful MPNNs. To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz continuous. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works ignore the order-invariant nature of the bundle and adopt sequential modeling methods as the solution, which might introduce inductive bias and cause a large latency in prediction. To address this problem, we propose to perform the bundle generation via non-autoregressive mechanism and design a novel encoder-decoder framework named BundleNAT, which can effectively output the targeted bundle in one-shot without relying on any inherent order. In detail, instead of learning sequential dependency, we propose to adopt pre-training techniques and graph neural network to fully embed user-based preference and item-based compatibility information, and use a self-attention based encoder to further extract global dependency pattern. We then design a permutation-equivariant decoding architecture that is able to directly output the desired bundle in a one-shot manner. Experiments on three real-world datasets from Youshu and Netease show the proposed BundleNAT significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in average by up to 35.92%, 10.97% and 23.67% absolute improvements in Precision, Precision+, and Recall, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Processing & Management</p></details> |
| **[Open Ad Hoc Teamwork with Cooperative Game Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15259v4)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ad hoc teamwork poses a challenging problem, requiring the design of an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination or joint training. Open ad hoc teamwork (OAHT) further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. One promising solution in practice to this problem is leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks to handle an unrestricted number of agents with various agent-types, named graph-based policy learning (GPL). However, its joint Q-value representation over a coordination graph lacks convincing explanations. In this paper, we establish a new theory to understand the representation of the joint Q-value for OAHT and its learning paradigm, through the lens of cooperative game theory. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm named CIAO, based on GPL's framework, with additional provable implementation tricks that can facilitate learning. The demos of experimental results are available on https://sites.google.com/view/ciao2024, and the code of experiments is published on https://github.com/hsvgbkhgbv/CIAO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2024, 29 pages</p></details> |
| **[Self-explainable Graph Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease And Related Dementias Risk Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06584v4)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the US, underlining the importance of accurate ADRD risk prediction. While recent advancement in ADRD risk prediction have primarily relied on imaging analysis, yet not all patients undergo medical imaging before an ADRD diagnosis. Merging machine learning with claims data can reveal additional risk factors and uncover interconnections among diverse medical codes. Objective: Our goal is to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with claims data for ADRD risk prediction. Addressing the lack of human-interpretable reasons behind these predictions, we introduce an innovative method to evaluate relationship importance and its influence on ADRD risk prediction, ensuring comprehensive interpretation. Methods: We employed Variationally Regularized Encoder-decoder Graph Neural Network (VGNN) for estimating ADRD likelihood. We created three scenarios to assess the model's efficiency, using Random Forest and Light Gradient Boost Machine as baselines. We further used our relation importance method to clarify the key relationships for ADRD risk prediction. Results: VGNN surpassed other baseline models by 10% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic. The integration of the GNN model and relation importance interpretation could potentially play an essential role in providing valuable insight into factors that may contribute to or delay ADRD progression. Conclusions: Employing a GNN approach with claims data enhances ADRD risk prediction and provides insights into the impact of interconnected medical code relationships. This methodology not only enables ADRD risk modeling but also shows potential for other image analysis predictions using claims data.</p></details> |  |

This study presents the first attempt to model 4D pMRI using a GNN-based spatiotemporal model PerfGAT, integrating spatial information and temporal kinetics to predict Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status in glioma patients. Specifically, we propose a graph structure learning approach based on edge attention and negative graphs to optimize temporal correlations modeling. Moreover, we design a dual-attention feature fusion module to integrate spatiotemporal features while addressing tumor-related brain regions. Further, we develop a class-balanced augmentation methods tailored to spatiotemporal data, which could mitigate the common label imbalance issue in clinical datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, promising to model pMRI effectively for patient characterization.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Networks Under Fire](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06417v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictions made by graph neural networks (GNNs) usually lack interpretability due to their complex computational behavior and the abstract nature of graphs. In an attempt to tackle this, many GNN explanation methods have emerged. Their goal is to explain a model's predictions and thereby obtain trust when GNN models are deployed in decision critical applications. Most GNN explanation methods work in a post-hoc manner and provide explanations in the form of a small subset of important edges and/or nodes. In this paper we demonstrate that these explanations can unfortunately not be trusted, as common GNN explanation methods turn out to be highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations. That is, even small perturbations of the original graph structure that preserve the model's predictions may yield drastically different explanations. This calls into question the trustworthiness and practical utility of post-hoc explanation methods for GNNs. To be able to attack GNN explanation models, we devise a novel attack method dubbed \textit{GXAttack}, the first \textit{optimization-based} adversarial attack method for post-hoc GNN explanations under such settings. Due to the devastating effectiveness of our attack, we call for an adversarial evaluation of future GNN explainers to demonstrate their robustness.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new universal architecture based on Graph Neural Network, the Message Passing Transformer, which incorporates a Message Passing framework, employs an Encoder-Processor-Decoder structure, and applies Graph Fourier Loss as loss function for model optimization. To take advantage of the past message passing state information, we propose Hadamard-Product Attention to update the node attribute in the Processor, Hadamard-Product Attention is a variant of Dot-Product Attention that focuses on more fine-grained semantics and emphasizes on assigning attention weights over each feature dimension rather than each position in the sequence relative to others. We further introduce Graph Fourier Loss (GFL) to balance high-energy and low-energy components. To improve time performance, we precompute the graph's Laplacian eigenvectors before the training process. Our architecture achieves significant accuracy improvements in long-term rollouts for both Lagrangian and Eulerian dynamical systems over current methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Homomorphism Counts for Graph Neural Networks: All About That Basis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08595v5)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large body of work has investigated the properties of graph neural networks and identified several limitations, particularly pertaining to their expressive power. Their inability to count certain patterns (e.g., cycles) in a graph lies at the heart of such limitations, since many functions to be learned rely on the ability of counting such patterns. Two prominent paradigms aim to address this limitation by enriching the graph features with subgraph or homomorphism pattern counts. In this work, we show that both of these approaches are sub-optimal in a certain sense and argue for a more fine-grained approach, which incorporates the homomorphism counts of all structures in the ``basis'' of the target pattern. This yields strictly more expressive architectures without incurring any additional overhead in terms of computational complexity compared to existing approaches. We prove a series of theoretical results on node-level and graph-level motif parameters and empirically validate them on standard benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Forty-First International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

| **[Combinatorial Optimization with Automated Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02872v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, such as maximum cut and maximum independent set. The core idea behind these methods is to represent a CO problem as a graph and then use GNNs to learn the node/graph embedding with combinatorial information. Although these methods have achieved promising results, given a specific CO problem, the design of GNN architectures still requires heavy manual work with domain knowledge. Existing automated GNNs are mostly focused on traditional graph learning problems, which is inapplicable to solving NP-hard CO problems. To this end, we present a new class of \textbf{AUTO}mated \textbf{G}NNs for solving \textbf{NP}-hard problems, namely \textbf{AutoGNP}. We represent CO problems by GNNs and focus on two specific problems, i.e., mixed integer linear programming and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. The idea of AutoGNP is to use graph neural architecture search algorithms to automatically find the best GNNs for a given NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Compared with existing graph neural architecture search algorithms, AutoGNP utilizes two-hop operators in the architecture search space. Moreover, AutoGNP utilizes simulated annealing and a strict early stopping policy to avoid local optimal solutions. Empirical results on benchmark combinatorial problems demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We introduce a graph neural network (GNN) approach that emulates the problem's combinatorially-complex optimal online algorithm, which selects actions (e.g., which nodes to match) by computing each action's value-to-go (VTG) -- the expected weight of the final matching if the algorithm takes that action, then acts optimally in the future. We train a GNN to estimate VTG and show empirically that this GNN returns high-weight matchings across a variety of tasks. Moreover, we identify a common family of graph distributions in spatial crowdsourcing applications, such as rideshare, under which VTG can be efficiently approximated by aggregating information within local neighborhoods in the graphs. This structure matches the local behavior of GNNs, providing theoretical justification for our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Decision-focused Graph Neural Networks for Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03647v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been notable interest in investigating combinatorial optimization (CO) problems by neural-based framework. An emerging strategy to tackle these challenging problems involves the adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs) as an alternative to traditional algorithms, a subject that has attracted considerable attention. Despite the growing popularity of GNNs and traditional algorithm solvers in the realm of CO, there is limited research on their integrated use and the correlation between them within an end-to-end framework. The primary focus of our work is to formulate a more efficient and precise framework for CO by employing decision-focused learning on graphs. Additionally, we introduce a decision-focused framework that utilizes GNNs to address CO problems with auxiliary support. To realize an end-to-end approach, we have designed two cascaded modules: (a) an unsupervised trained graph predictive model, and (b) a solver for quadratic binary unconstrained optimization. Empirical evaluations are conducted on various classical tasks, including maximum cut, maximum independent set, and minimum vertex cover. The experimental results on classical CO problems (i.e. MaxCut, MIS, and MVC) demonstrate the superiority of our method over both the standalone GNN approach and classical methods.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks for (Mixed-Integer) Quadratic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05938v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic programming (QP) is the most widely applied category of problems in nonlinear programming. Many applications require real-time/fast solutions, though not necessarily with high precision. Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective precondition. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. Despite notable empirical observations, theoretical foundations are still lacking. In this work, we investigate the expressive or representative power of GNNs, a crucial aspect of neural network theory, specifically in the context of QP tasks, with both continuous and mixed-integer settings. We prove the existence of message-passing GNNs that can reliably represent key properties of quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective value, and optimal solution. Our theory is validated by numerical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Scaling Laws on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02054v2)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep graph models (e.g., graph neural networks and graph transformers) have become important techniques for leveraging knowledge across various types of graphs. Yet, the scaling properties of deep graph models have not been systematically investigated, casting doubt on the feasibility of achieving large graph models through enlarging the model and dataset sizes. In this work, we delve into neural scaling laws on graphs from both model and data perspectives. We first verify the validity of such laws on graphs, establishing formulations to describe the scaling behaviors. For model scaling, we investigate the phenomenon of scaling law collapse and identify overfitting as the potential reason. Moreover, we reveal that the model depth of deep graph models can impact the model scaling behaviors, which differ from observations in other domains such as CV and NLP. For data scaling, we suggest that the number of graphs can not effectively metric the graph data volume in scaling law since the sizes of different graphs are highly irregular. Instead, we reform the data scaling law with the number of edges as the metric to address the irregular graph sizes. We further demonstrate the reformed law offers a unified view of the data scaling behaviors for various fundamental graph tasks including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. This work provides valuable insights into neural scaling laws on graphs, which can serve as an essential step toward large graph models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Security Vulnerability Detection with Multitask Self-Instructed Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05892v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software security vulnerabilities allow attackers to perform malicious activities to disrupt software operations. Recent Transformer-based language models have significantly advanced vulnerability detection, surpassing the capabilities of static analysis based deep learning models. However, language models trained solely on code tokens do not capture either the explanation of vulnerability type or the data flow structure information of code, both of which are crucial for vulnerability detection. We propose a novel technique that integrates a multitask sequence-to-sequence LLM with pro-gram control flow graphs encoded as a graph neural network to achieve sequence-to-classification vulnerability detection. We introduce MSIVD, multitask self-instructed fine-tuning for vulnerability detection, inspired by chain-of-thought prompting and LLM self-instruction. Our experiments demonstrate that MSIVD achieves superior performance, outperforming the highest LLM-based vulnerability detector baseline (LineVul), with a F1 score of 0.92 on the BigVul dataset, and 0.48 on the PreciseBugs dataset. By training LLMs and GNNs simultaneously using a combination of code and explanatory metrics of a vulnerable program, MSIVD represents a promising direction for advancing LLM-based vulnerability detection that generalizes to unseen data. Based on our findings, we further discuss the necessity for new labelled security vulnerability datasets, as recent LLMs have seen or memorized prior datasets' held-out evaluation data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Graph Convolutions for Mobile Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05850v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To compete with existing mobile architectures, MobileViG introduces Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA), a fast token-mixing operator based on the principles of GNNs. However, MobileViG scales poorly with model size, falling at most 1% behind models with similar latency. This paper introduces Mobile Graph Convolution (MGC), a new vision graph neural network (ViG) module that solves this scaling problem. Our proposed mobile vision architecture, MobileViGv2, uses MGC to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. MGC improves on SVGA by increasing graph sparsity and introducing conditional positional encodings to the graph operation. Our smallest model, MobileViGv2-Ti, achieves a 77.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 2% higher than MobileViG-Ti, with 0.9 ms inference latency on the iPhone 13 Mini NPU. Our largest model, MobileViGv2-B, achieves an 83.4% top-1 accuracy, 0.8% higher than MobileViG-B, with 2.7 ms inference latency. Besides image classification, we show that MobileViGv2 generalizes well to other tasks. For object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, MobileViGv2-M outperforms MobileViG-M by 1.2 $AP^{box}$ and 0.7 $AP^{mask}$, and MobileViGv2-B outperforms MobileViG-B by 1.0 $AP^{box}$ and 0.7 $AP^{mask}$. For semantic segmentation on ADE20K, MobileViGv2-M achieves 42.9% $mIoU$ and MobileViGv2-B achieves 44.3% $mIoU$.

Quantum capability learning with physics-aware neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05636v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize diverse fields, including quantum chemistry, materials science, and machine learning. However, contemporary quantum computers experience errors that often cause quantum programs run on them to fail. Until quantum computers can reliably execute large quantum programs, stakeholders will need fast and reliable methods for assessing a quantum computer's capability-i.e., the programs it can run and how well it can run them. Previously, off-the-shelf neural network architectures have been used to model quantum computers' capabilities, but with limited success, because these networks fail to learn the complex quantum physics that determines real quantum computers' errors. We address this shortcoming with a new quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture for learning capability models. Our architecture combines aspects of graph neural networks with efficient approximations to the physics of errors in quantum programs. This approach achieves up to $\sim50\%$ reductions in mean absolute error on both experimental and simulated data, over state-of-the-art models based on convolutional neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Cooperative Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01267v2)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are popular architectures for graph machine learning, based on iterative computation of node representations of an input graph through a series of invariant transformations. A large class of graph neural networks follow a standard message-passing paradigm: at every layer, each node state is updated based on an aggregate of messages from its neighborhood. In this work, we propose a novel framework for training graph neural networks, where every node is viewed as a player that can choose to either 'listen', 'broadcast', 'listen and broadcast', or to 'isolate'. The standard message propagation scheme can then be viewed as a special case of this framework where every node 'listens and broadcasts' to all neighbors. Our approach offers a more flexible and dynamic message-passing paradigm, where each node can determine its own strategy based on their state, effectively exploring the graph topology while learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the new message-passing scheme which is further supported by an extensive empirical analysis on a synthetic dataset and on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Forty-First International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

| **[Rethinking the Capacity of Graph Neural Networks for Branching Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07099v2)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to predict properties and heuristics of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and hence accelerate MILP solvers. This paper investigates the capacity of GNNs to represent strong branching (SB), the most effective yet computationally expensive heuristic employed in the branch-and-bound algorithm. In the literature, message-passing GNN (MP-GNN), as the simplest GNN structure, is frequently used as a fast approximation of SB and we find that not all MILPs's SB can be represented with MP-GNN. We precisely define a class of "MP-tractable" MILPs for which MP-GNNs can accurately approximate SB scores. Particularly, we establish a universal approximation theorem: for any data distribution over the MP-tractable class, there always exists an MP-GNN that can approximate the SB score with arbitrarily high accuracy and arbitrarily high probability, which lays a theoretical foundation of the existing works on imitating SB with MP-GNN. For MILPs without the MP-tractability, unfortunately, a similar result is impossible, which can be illustrated by two MILP instances with different SB scores that cannot be distinguished by any MP-GNN, regardless of the number of parameters. Recognizing this, we explore another GNN structure called the second-order folklore GNN (2-FGNN) that overcomes this limitation, and the aforementioned universal approximation theorem can be extended to the entire MILP space using 2-FGNN, regardless of the MP-tractability. A small-scale numerical experiment is conducted to directly validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prioritizing Potential Wetland Areas via Region-to-Region Knowledge Transfer and Adaptive Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05578v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wetlands are important to communities, offering benefits ranging from water purification, and flood protection to recreation and tourism. Therefore, identifying and prioritizing potential wetland areas is a critical decision problem. While data-driven solutions are feasible, this is complicated by significant data sparsity due to the low proportion of wetlands (3-6\%) in many areas of interest in the southwestern US. This makes it hard to develop data-driven models that can help guide the identification of additional wetland areas. To solve this limitation, we propose two strategies: (1) The first of these is knowledge transfer from regions with rich wetlands (such as the Eastern US) to sparser regions (such as the Southwestern area with few wetlands). Recognizing that these regions are likely to be very different from each other in terms of soil characteristics, population distribution, and land use, we propose a domain disentanglement strategy that identifies and transfers only the applicable aspects of the learned model. (2) We complement this with a spatial data enrichment strategy that relies on an adaptive propagation mechanism. This mechanism differentiates between node pairs that have positive and negative impacts on each other for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To summarize, given two spatial cells belonging to different regions, we identify domain-specific and domain-shareable features, and, for each region, we rely on adaptive propagation to enrich features with the features of surrounding cells. We conduct rigorous experiments to substantiate our proposed method's effectiveness, robustness, and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, an ablation study demonstrates that each module is essential in prioritizing potential wetlands, which justifies our assumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Entropy in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06632v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are Graph Neural Networks where the convolutions are applied over a graph. In contrast to Convolutional Neural Networks, GCN's are designed to perform inference on graphs, where the number of nodes can vary, and the nodes are unordered. In this study, we address two important challenges related to GCNs: i) oversmoothing; and ii) the utilization of node relational properties (i.e., heterophily and homophily). Oversmoothing is the degradation of the discriminative capacity of nodes as a result of repeated aggregations. Heterophily is the tendency for nodes of different classes to connect, whereas homophily is the tendency of similar nodes to connect. We propose a new strategy for addressing these challenges in GCNs based on Transfer Entropy (TE), which measures of the amount of directed transfer of information between two time varying nodes. Our findings indicate that using node heterophily and degree information as a node selection mechanism, along with feature-based TE calculations, enhances accuracy across various GCN models. Our model can be easily modified to improve classification accuracy of a GCN model. As a trade off, this performance boost comes with a significant computational overhead when the TE is computed for many graph nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 In...</summary><p>28 International Conference Information Visualisation</p></details> |
