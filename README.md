| **[PMM-Net: Single-stage Multi-agent Trajectory Prediction with Patching-based Embedding and Explicit Modal Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19544v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians plays a pivotal role for embodied intelligent applications. The inherent indeterminacy of human behavior and complex social interaction among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than common time-series forecasting. In this letter, we aim to explore a distinct formulation for multi-agent trajectory prediction framework. Specifically, we proposed a patching-based temporal feature extraction module and a graph-based social feature extraction module, enabling effective feature extraction and cross-scenario generalization. Moreover, we reassess the role of social interaction and present a novel method based on explicit modality modulation to integrate temporal and social features, thereby constructing an efficient single-stage inference pipeline. Results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Utilizing Image Transforms and Diffusion Models for Generative Modeling of Short and Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19538v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lately, there has been a surge in interest surrounding generative modeling of time series data. Most existing approaches are designed either to process short sequences or to handle long-range sequences. This dichotomy can be attributed to gradient issues with recurrent networks, computational costs associated with transformers, and limited expressiveness of state space models. Towards a unified generative model for varying-length time series, we propose in this work to transform sequences into images. By employing invertible transforms such as the delay embedding and the short-time Fourier transform, we unlock three main advantages: i) We can exploit advanced diffusion vision models; ii) We can remarkably process short- and long-range inputs within the same framework; and iii) We can harness recent and established tools proposed in the time series to image literature. We validate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks, including unconditional generation, interpolation, and extrapolation. We show that our approach achieves consistently state-of-the-art results against strong baselines. In the unconditional generation tasks, we show remarkable mean improvements of 58.17% over previous diffusion models in the short discriminative score and 132.61% in the (ultra-)long classification scores.

| **[Beyond Conformal Predictors: Adaptive Conformal Inference with Confidence Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15548v3)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction (CP) is a robust framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification, but it requires exchangeable data to ensure valid prediction sets at a user-specified significance level. When this assumption is violated, as in time-series or other structured data, the validity guarantees of CP no longer hold. Adaptive conformal inference (ACI) was introduced to address this limitation by adjusting the significance level dynamically, ensuring finite-sample coverage guarantees even for non-exchangeable data. In this paper, we show that ACI does not require the use of conformal predictors; instead, it can be implemented with the more general confidence predictors, which are computationally simpler and still maintain the crucial property of nested prediction sets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that confidence predictors can perform comparably to, or even better than, conformal predictors, particularly in terms of computational efficiency. These findings suggest that confidence predictors represent a viable and efficient alternative to conformal predictors in non-exchangeable data settings, although further studies are needed to identify when one method is superior.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 5 figures.

| **[LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods often struggle with inefficiency and the handling of high-dimensional data. To address these research gap, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. On this basis, we propose two adaptive modules for enhancing the algebraic characterization of acyclicity with new capabilities: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML generates causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring the creation of DAGs while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing the dynamic causal structure of high-dimensional data and enhancing interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods, and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery. Our code will be available soon.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Variational Schr√∂dinger Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04795v4)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[MC-QDSNN: Quantized Deep evolutionary SNN with Multi-Dendritic Compartment Neurons for Stress Detection using Physiological Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04992v3)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network for analyzing and inferring time series data. LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Robust Time Series Causal Discovery for Agent-Based Model Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19412v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Model (ABM) validation is crucial as it helps ensuring the reliability of simulations, and causal discovery has become a powerful tool in this context. However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures. The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches. By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented. These improvements increase the reliability of model-driven decision making processes in complex systems analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMSPLIT: A Communication-Aware Split Learning Design for Heterogeneous IoT Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19375v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The significance of distributed learning and inference algorithms in Internet of Things (IoT) network is growing since they flexibly distribute computation load between IoT devices and the infrastructure, enhance data privacy, and minimize latency. However, a notable challenge stems from the influence of communication channel conditions on their performance. In this work, we introduce COMSPLIT: a novel communication-aware design for split learning (SL) and inference paradigm tailored to processing time series data in IoT networks. COMSPLIT provides a versatile framework for deploying adaptable SL in IoT networks affected by diverse channel conditions. In conjunction with the integration of an early-exit strategy, and addressing IoT scenarios containing devices with heterogeneous computational capabilities, COMSPLIT represents a comprehensive design solution for communication-aware SL in IoT networks. Numerical results show superior performance of COMSPLIT compared to vanilla SL approaches (that assume ideal communication channel), demonstrating its ability to offer both design simplicity and adaptability to different channel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[A Stock Price Prediction Approach Based on Time Series Decomposition and Multi-Scale CNN using OHLCT Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19291v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, government policies, and market sentiment, which together make price movements complex and difficult to predict. Despite many studies aimed at enhancing stock price prediction models, challenges such as data noise, model overfitting, and lack of interpretability are still encountered. To address these issues and improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a novel method, named Sequence-based Multiscale Fusion Regression Convolutional Neural Network (SMSFR-CNN), for predicting stock price movements in the China A-share market. By utilizing CNN to learn sequential features and combining them with image features, we improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction on the A-share market stock dataset. This approach reduces the search space for image features, stabilizes, and accelerates the training process. Extensive comparative experiments on 4,454 A-share stocks show that the proposed model achieves 61.15% for positive predictive value and 63.37% for negative predictive value of the stock price trend over the next 5 days, resulting in a total profit of 165.09%.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[TEAM: Topological Evolution-aware Framework for Traffic Forecasting--Extended Version](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19192v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the global trend towards urbanization, people increasingly move to and live in cities that then continue to grow. Traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent transportation systems of cities as well as in spatio-temporal data mining. State-of-the-art forecasting is achieved by deep-learning approaches due to their ability to contend with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, existing methods assume the input is fixed-topology road networks and static traffic time series. These assumptions fail to align with urbanization, where time series are collected continuously and road networks evolve over time. In such settings, deep-learning models require frequent re-initialization and re-training, imposing high computational costs. To enable much more efficient training without jeopardizing model accuracy, we propose the Topological Evolution-aware Framework (TEAM) for traffic forecasting that incorporates convolution and attention. This combination of mechanisms enables better adaptation to newly collected time series, while being able to maintain learned knowledge from old time series. TEAM features a continual learning module based on the Wasserstein metric that acts as a buffer that can identify the most stable and the most changing network nodes. Then, only data related to stable nodes is employed for re-training when consolidating a model. Further, only data of new nodes and their adjacent nodes as well as data pertaining to changing nodes are used to re-train the model. Empirical studies with two real-world traffic datasets offer evidence that TEAM is capable of much lower re-training costs than existing methods are, without jeopardizing forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

| **[Wildfire Risk Prediction: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01607v4)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wildfires have significant impacts on global vegetation, wildlife, and humans. They destroy plant communities and wildlife habitats and contribute to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and other pollutants. The prediction of wildfires relies on various independent variables combined with regression or machine learning methods. In this technical review, we describe the options for independent variables, data processing techniques, models, independent variables collinearity and importance estimation methods, and model performance evaluation metrics. First, we divide the independent variables into 4 aspects, including climate and meteorology conditions, socio-economical factors, terrain and hydrological features, and wildfire historical records. Second, preprocessing methods are described for different magnitudes, different spatial-temporal resolutions, and different formats of data. Third, the collinearity and importance evaluation methods of independent variables are also considered. Fourth, we discuss the application of statistical models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in wildfire risk prediction. In this subsection, compared with other reviews, this manuscript particularly discusses the evaluation metrics and recent advancements in deep learning methods. Lastly, addressing the limitations of current research, this paper emphasizes the need for more effective deep learning time series forecasting algorithms, the utilization of three-dimensional data including ground and trunk fuel, extraction of more accurate historical fire point data, and improved model evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting is a critical task in decision making across various domains. While numerical data provides a foundation, it often lacks crucial context necessary for accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge or constraints, which can be efficiently communicated through natural language. However, the ability of existing forecasting models to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. By presenting this benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal forecasting, promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at https://servicenow.github.io/context-is-key-forecasting/v0/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review.

| **[Data Augmentation of Multivariate Sensor Time Series using Autoregressive Models and Application to Failure Prognostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16419v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel data augmentation solution for non-stationary multivariate time series and its application to failure prognostics. The method extends previous work from the authors which is based on time-varying autoregressive processes. It can be employed to extract key information from a limited number of samples and generate new synthetic samples in a way that potentially improves the performance of PHM solutions. This is especially valuable in situations of data scarcity which are very usual in PHM, especially for failure prognostics. The proposed approach is tested based on the CMAPSS dataset, commonly employed for prognostics experiments and benchmarks. An AutoML approach from PHM literature is employed for automating the design of the prognostics solution. The empirical evaluation provides evidence that the proposed method can substantially improve the performance of PHM solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT of paper to appear at 2024 Conference of PHM Society</p></details> |
| **[Limit Theorems for the Symbolic Correlation Integral and the Renyi-2 Entropy under Short-range Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18726v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The symbolic correlation integral provides a way to measure the complexity of time series and dynamical systems. In the present article we prove limit results for an estimator of this quantity which is based on U-statistics under the assumption of short-range dependence. To this end, we slightly generalize classical limit results in the framework of 1-approximating functionals. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the limit variance. A simulation study with ARMA and ARCH time series as well as a real world data example are also provided. In the latter we show how our method could be used to analyze EEG data in the context of epileptic seizures.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18712v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While time series diffusion models have received considerable focus from many recent works, the performance of existing models remains highly unstable. Factors limiting time series diffusion models include insufficient time series datasets and the absence of guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval- Augmented Time series Diffusion model (RATD). The framework of RATD consists of two parts: an embedding-based retrieval process and a reference-guided diffusion model. In the first part, RATD retrieves the time series that are most relevant to historical time series from the database as references. The references are utilized to guide the denoising process in the second part. Our approach allows leveraging meaningful samples within the database to aid in sampling, thus maximizing the utilization of datasets. Meanwhile, this reference-guided mechanism also compensates for the deficiencies of existing time series diffusion models in terms of guidance. Experiments and visualizations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in complicated prediction tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Large Language Models for Financial Aid in Financial Time-series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19025v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Considering the difficulty of financial time series forecasting in financial aid, much of the current research focuses on leveraging big data analytics in financial services. One modern approach is to utilize "predictive analysis", analogous to forecasting financial trends. However, many of these time series data in Financial Aid (FA) pose unique challenges due to limited historical datasets and high dimensional financial information, which hinder the development of effective predictive models that balance accuracy with efficient runtime and memory usage. Pre-trained foundation models are employed to address these challenging tasks. We use state-of-the-art time series models including pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2 as the backbone), transformers, and linear models to demonstrate their ability to outperform traditional approaches, even with minimal ("few-shot") or no fine-tuning ("zero-shot"). Our benchmark study, which includes financial aid with seven other time series tasks, shows the potential of using LLMs for scarce financial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub link https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Financial-Time-Series</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs with Semantic Space Alignment for Enhanced Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18686v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention and introduced novel perspectives in time series classification. However, existing approaches often overlook the crucial dynamic temporal information inherent in time series data and face challenges in aligning this data with textual semantics. To address these limitations, we propose HiTime, a hierarchical multi-modal model that seamlessly integrates temporal information into LLMs for multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Our model employs a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data through both data-specific and task-specific embeddings. To facilitate semantic space alignment between time series and text, we introduce a dual-view contrastive alignment module that bridges the gap between modalities. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid prompting strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained LLM in a parameter-efficient manner. By effectively incorporating dynamic temporal features and ensuring semantic alignment, HiTime enables LLMs to process continuous time series data and achieves state-of-the-art classification performance through text generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiTime significantly enhances time series classification accuracy compared to most competitive baseline methods. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating temporal features into LLMs, paving the way for advanced time series analysis. The code is publicly available for further research and validation. Our codes are publicly available1.</p></details> |  |

Pre-trained on large-scale real-world data, TripCast notably outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in in-domain forecasting scenarios and demonstrates strong scalability and transferability in out-domain forecasting scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Attention Neural Network Performance for Marijuana Consumption Classification through Large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) Analysis of Functional MR Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18506v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present research, the effectiveness of large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) as a tool for gauging brain network connectivity was examined to differentiate between marijuana users and typical controls by utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Inferring Latent Graphs from Stationary Signals Using a Graphical Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18445v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are an intuitive way to represent relationships between variables in fields such as finance and neuroscience. However, these graphs often need to be inferred from data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to infer a latent graph by treating the observed multidimensional data as graph-referenced stationary signals. Specifically, we introduce the graphical autoregressive model (GAR), where the inverse covariance matrix of the observed signals is expressed as a second-order polynomial of the normalized graph Laplacian of the latent graph. The GAR model extends the autoregressive model from time series analysis to general undirected graphs, offering a new approach to graph inference. To estimate the latent graph, we develop a three-step procedure based on penalized maximum likelihood, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Simulation studies and an application to S&P 500 stock price data show that the GAR model can outperform Gaussian graphical models when it fits the observed data well. Our results suggest that the GAR model offers a promising new direction for inferring latent graphs across diverse applications.

We aim to provide consistent fertility forecasts for Australian women characterized by age, region, and birthplace. Age-specific fertility rates at the national and sub-national levels obtained from census data between 1981-2011 are jointly modeled and forecast by the grouped functional time series method. Forecasts for women of each region and birthplace are reconciled following the chosen hierarchies to ensure that results at various disaggregation levels consistently sum up to the respective national total. Coupling the region of residence disaggregation structure with the trace minimization reconciliation method produces the most accurate point and interval forecasts. In addition, age-specific fertility rates disaggregated by the birthplace of women show significant heterogeneity that supports the application of the grouped forecasting method.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/TimeXer.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data of its decomposed trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and highlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting.

| **[System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13254v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optical next generation reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial neural networks with internal dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises its physical openness, posing challenges for realizations in physical systems. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delayed inputs. Much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, we show that the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and large-scale Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, increased interpretability and fewer hyperparameters compared to conventional optical RC based on scattering media, while achieving better forecasting performance. Our optical NGRC framework may inspire the realization of NGRC in other physical RC systems, new applications beyond time-series processing, and the development of deep and parallel architectures broadly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting X-formers with Structured Matrix for Long Sequence Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12462v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models for long sequence time series forecasting problems have gained significant attention due to their exceptional forecasting precision. However, the self-attention mechanism introduces challenges in terms of computational efficiency due to its quadratic time complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel architectural framework that enhances Transformer models through the integration of Surrogate Attention Blocks (SAB) and Surrogate Feed-Forward Neural Network Blocks (SFB). They replace the self-attention and feed-forward layer by leveraging structured matrices that reduce both time and space complexity while maintaining the expressive power of the original self-attention mechanism and feed-forward network. The equivalence of this substitution is fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments on nine Transformer variants across five distinct time series tasks demonstrate an average performance improvement of 9.45%, alongside a 46% reduction in model size. These results confirm the efficacy of our surrogate-based approach in maintaining prediction accuracy while significantly boosting computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent deep learning advancements, increased model complexity, and larger model sizes, many state-of-the-art models often perform worse or on par with simpler models. One of those cases is a recently proposed model, FITS, claiming competitive performance with significantly reduced parameter counts. By training a one-layer neural network in the complex frequency domain, we are able to replicate these results. Our experiments on a wide range of real-world datasets further reveal that FITS especially excels at capturing periodic and seasonal patterns, but struggles with trending, non-periodic, or random-resembling behavior. With our two novel hybrid approaches, where we attempt to remedy the weaknesses of FITS by combining it with DLinear, we achieve the best results of any known open-source model on multivariate regression and promising results in multiple/linear regression on price datasets, on top of vastly improving upon what FITS achieves as a standalone model.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv:2307.03756v3 45 pages, 36 figures</p></details> |

| **[CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02131v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024, the project can be found at https://github.com/RafaDD/CondTSF</p></details> |

After World War II, the Federal Republic of Germany was formed in 1949. Since then every plenary session of the German Bundestag was logged and even has been digitized over the course of the last few years. We analyze these texts using a time series variant of the topic model LDA to investigate which events had a lasting effect on the political discourse and how the political topics changed over time. This allows us to detect changes in word frequency (and thus key discussion points) in political discourse.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

We rely on an architecture called Barlow Twins, borrowed from an understanding of the human visual cortical system and originally envisioned for the image domain and adapt it for learning path invariance in seismic event time series. Our model improves the performance on event characterization tasks such as source discrimination across catalogs by 10-12% and provides more reliable predictive uncertainty estimates. We suggest that dataset scale and diversity more than architecture may determine aspects of the current ceiling on performance. We leverage decision trees, linear models, and visualization to understanding the dependencies in learned representations.</p></details> |  |

However, in a temporal setting, multi-modal data are often inherently asynchronous. EHR can be continuously collected but CXR is generally taken with a much longer interval due to its high cost and radiation dose. When clinical prediction is needed, the last available CXR image might have been outdated, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this challenge, we propose DDL-CXR, a method that dynamically generates an up-to-date latent representation of the individualized CXR images. Our approach leverages latent diffusion models for patient-specific generation strategically conditioned on a previous CXR image and EHR time series, providing information regarding anatomical structures and disease progressions, respectively. In this way, the interaction across modalities could be better captured by the latent CXR generation process, ultimately improving the prediction performance. Experiments using MIMIC datasets show that the proposed model could effectively address asynchronicity in multimodal fusion and consistently outperform existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS-24</p></details> |

Traditional methods typically focus on identifying anomalies in immediate subsequent steps, often underestimating the significance of temporal dynamics such as delay time and horizons of anomalies, which generally require extensive post-analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach for time series anomaly prediction, incorporating temporal information directly into the prediction results. We propose a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive experiments using several state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and accurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for traditional analysis methods. The sheer scale of this data exceeds the capabilities of manual exploration, necessitating the utilization of advanced computational techniques. In response to this challenge, we developed a novel approach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical G-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly advanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity from time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive performance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean square error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance of 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE) is 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating metallicity values. Our work underscores the importance of deep learning in astronomical research, particularly with large datasets from missions like Gaia. By harnessing the power of deep learning methods, we can provide precision in analyzing vast datasets, contributing to more precise and comprehensive insights into complex astronomical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>Senso...</summary><p>Sensors 2024, 24(16), 5203; (23 pages)</p></details> |

By leveraging unsupervised methods with supervised optimization, our approach prioritizes interpretability while ensuring robust and generalizable performance on unseen data. Through experimentation, a combination of binary segmentation for change point detection and statistical process control for anomaly detection emerges as the most effective strategy, specifically when ensembled in a novel sequential manner. Results indicate the clear wasted potential when filtering is not applied. The automatic load estimation is also fairly accurate, with approximately 90% of estimates falling within a 10% error margin, with only a single significant failure in both the minimum and maximum load estimates across 60 measurements in the test set.

Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

Most existing methods manually build specific CL Strategies (CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually developing CLS usually requires excessive prior knowledge about the data, and massive experiments to determine the detailed CL configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns CLS for time series datasets and tasks, namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled search space of size over $3\times10^{12}$, covering data augmentation, embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction, and contrastive losses. Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the suitable CLS for the given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets. We also provide empirical analysis as a guide for the future design of CLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024. Fixed typos</p></details> |

Capturing patterns both within and between temporal and multivariate components is crucial for reliable predictions. We introduce xLSTM-Mixer, a model designed to effectively integrate temporal sequences, joint time-variate information, and multiple perspectives for robust forecasting. Our approach begins with a linear forecast shared across variates, which is then refined by xLSTM blocks. These blocks serve as key elements for modeling the complex dynamics of challenging time series data. xLSTM-Mixer ultimately reconciles two distinct views to produce the final forecast. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate xLSTM-Mixer's superior long-term forecasting performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. A thorough model analysis provides further insights into its key components and confirms its robustness and effectiveness.

Traditional models for company growth often focus too much on theory, overlooking practical forecasting, or they rely solely on time series forecasting techniques, ignoring interpretability and the inherent mechanisms of company growth. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based prediction framework that incorporates an econophysics model for company growth. Our model captures both the intrinsic growth mechanisms of companies led by scaling laws and the fluctuations influenced by random factors and individual decisions, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared with methods that use time series techniques alone. Its advantages are more pronounced in long-range prediction tasks. By explicitly modeling the baseline growth and volatility components, our model is more interpretable.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Current methods can only detect COPD from prominent features in spirogram (Volume-Flow time series) but cannot predict future COPD risk from subtle data patterns. We propose a deep learning-based method, DeepSpiro, for early prediction of future COPD risk. DeepSpiro consists of four key components: SpiroSmoother for stabilizing the Volume-Flow curve, SpiroEncoder for capturing volume evolution through key patches of varying lengths, SpiroExplainer for integrating heterogeneous data and explaining predictions through volume attention, and SpiroPredictor for predicting the disease risk of undiagnosed high-risk patients based on key patch concavity, with prediction horizons of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, or even longer. Evaluated on the UK Biobank dataset, DeepSpiro achieved an AUC of 0.8328 for COPD detection and demonstrated strong predictive performance for future COPD risk (p-value < 0.001). DeepSpiro effectively predicts the long-term progression of the disease.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, existing approaches rely solely on time-domain features ignoring frequency components providing complementary information. This paper proposes Time Frequency Domain Adaptation (TFDA), a method to cope with the source-free time-series domain adaptation problems. TFDA is developed with a dual branch network structure fully utilizing both time and frequency features in delivering final predictions. It induces pseudo-labels based on a neighborhood concept where predictions of a sample group are aggregated to generate reliable pseudo labels. The concept of contrastive learning is carried out in both time and frequency domains with pseudo label information and a negative pair exclusion strategy to make valid neighborhood assumptions. In addition, the time-frequency consistency technique is proposed using the self-distillation strategy while the uncertainty reduction strategy is implemented to alleviate uncertainties due to the domain shift problem. Last but not least, the curriculum learning strategy is integrated to combat noisy pseudo labels. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of our approach over prior arts with noticeable margins in benchmark problems.</p></details> |  |

TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 24 tables</p></details> |
| **[Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20423v3)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocate the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocity of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</p></details> |  |

Predicted stock returns can be incorporated into portfolio trading algorithms to make informed buy or sell decisions which can optimize returns. In such portfolio trading applications, the predictive performance of a time series forecasting model is crucial. In this work, we propose the use of the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) algorithm to progressively evolve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for stock return predictions. RNNs are evolved independently for each stocks and portfolio trading decisions are made based on the predicted stock returns. The portfolio used for testing consists of the 30 companies in the Dow-Jones Index (DJI) with each stock have the same weight. Results show that using these evolved RNNs and a simple daily long-short strategy can generate higher returns than both the DJI index and the S&P 500 Index for both 2022 (bear market) and 2023 (bull market).</p></details> |  |
| **[LiNo: Advancing Recursive Residual Decomposition of Linear and Nonlinear Patterns for Robust Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17159v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polyspectral Mean Estimation of General Nonlinear Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15187v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order spectra (or polyspectra), defined as the Fourier Transform of a stationary process' autocumulants, are useful in the analysis of nonlinear and non Gaussian processes. Polyspectral means are weighted averages over Fourier frequencies of the polyspectra, and estimators can be constructed from analogous weighted averages of the higher-order periodogram (a statistic computed from the data sample's discrete Fourier Transform). We derive the asymptotic distribution of a class of polyspectral mean estimators, obtaining an exact expression for the limit distribution that depends on both the given weighting function as well as on higher-order spectra. Secondly, we use bispectral means to define a new test of the linear process hypothesis. Simulations document the finite sample properties of the asymptotic results. Two applications illustrate our results' utility: we test the linear process hypothesis for a Sunspot time series, and for the Gross Domestic Product we conduct a clustering exercise based on bispectral means with different weight functions.</p></details> |  |

The data collected using this equipment can be used clinical staff to gain insight into the condition of the patients and provide adequate treatment, but it also provides ample opportunity for applications in machine learning and data science. While this data can frequently be used directly, complex problems may require additional annotations to provide context and meaning before it could be used to train the machine learning models. Annotating time-series datasets in clinical setting is a complex problem due to a large volume and complexity of the data, time-consuming nature of the process and the fact that clinicians' time is in both high demand and short supply. In this study, we present an evaluation of a bespoke tool designed to annotate large, clinical time-series datasets with staff from intensive care units. The software incorporates two modes for annotation: by annotating individual admissions and by generating rulesets which are applied to the entire dataset. Our study was split into two stages focusing on individual and semi-automated annotation and included 28 annotators across both stages who utilised 50 clinical parameters to guide their annotations. We experienced significant challenges in recruitment and engagement of the participants in the annotation activities and developed interventions which improved the participation over the course of the study. During the semi-automated annotation, we observed preferences for different parameter types (measured vs. observed), as well as relative agreement of participants across shared admissions to the decision-tree model trained using their rulesets.</p></details> |  |

One way of capturing causal relationships is by utilizing Bayesian networks. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph, in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model, which is utilized in the present contribution to formulate a score-based learning approach. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut ("lazy constraint") method. Comparing the novel approach to the state of the art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce excellent results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances of up to 25 time-series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bio-science and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the opportunities in developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle modest instances.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Enhancing Algorithm Performance Understanding through tsMorph: Generating Semi-Synthetic Time Series for Robust Forecasting Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01344v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a subject of significant scientific and industrial importance. Despite the widespread utilization of forecasting methods, there is a dearth of research aimed at comprehending the conditions under which these methods yield favorable or unfavorable performances. Empirical studies, although common, are challenged by the limited availability of time series datasets, restricting the extraction of reliable insights. To address this limitation, we present tsMorph, a tool for generating semi-synthetic time series through dataset morphing. tsMorph works by creating a sequence of datasets from two original datasets. The characteristics of the generated datasets progressively depart from those of one of the datasets and converge toward the attributes of the other dataset. This method provides a valuable alternative for obtaining substantial datasets. In this paper, we show the benefits of tsMorph by assessing the predictive performance of the Long Short-Term Memory Network and DeepAR forecasting algorithms. The time series used for the experiments comes from the NN5 Competition. The experimental results provide important insights. Notably, the performances of the two algorithms improve proportionally with the frequency of the time series. These experiments confirm that tsMorph can be an effective tool for better understanding the behavior of forecasting algorithms, delivering a pathway to overcoming the limitations posed by empirical studies and enabling more extensive and reliable experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Governing equation discovery of a complex system from snapshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16694v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems in physics, chemistry, and biology that evolve over time with inherent randomness are typically described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A fundamental challenge in science and engineering is to determine the governing equations of a complex system from snapshot data. Traditional equation discovery methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as the availability of the trajectory information or time-series data, and the presumption that the underlying system is deterministic. In this work, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-free framework, called Sparse Identification of Differential Equations from Snapshots (SpIDES), that discovers the governing equations of a complex system from snapshots by utilizing the advanced machine learning techniques to perform three essential steps: probability flow reconstruction, probability density estimation, and Bayesian sparse identification. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of SpIDES by successfully identifying the governing equation of an over-damped Langevin system confined within two potential wells. By extracting interpretable drift and diffusion terms from the SDEs, our framework provides deeper insights into system dynamics, enhances predictive accuracy, and facilitates more effective strategies for managing and simulating stochastic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Sparse Sampling: A Framework for Variable-Length Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06412v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the majority of time series classification research has focused on modeling fixed-length sequences, variable-length time series classification (VTSC) remains critical in healthcare, where sequence length may vary among patients and events. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{S}$tochastic $\textbf{S}$parse $\textbf{S}$ampling (SSS), a novel VTSC framework developed for medical time series. SSS manages variable-length sequences by sparsely sampling fixed windows to compute local predictions, which are then aggregated and calibrated to form a global prediction. We apply SSS to the task of seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, a critical VTSC problem requiring identification of seizure-inducing brain regions from variable-length electrophysiological time series. We evaluate our method on the Epilepsy iEEG Multicenter Dataset, a heterogeneous collection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings obtained from four independent medical centers. SSS demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across most medical centers, and superior performance on all out-of-distribution (OOD) unseen medical centers. Additionally, SSS naturally provides post-hoc insights into local signal characteristics related to the SOZ, by visualizing temporally averaged local predictions throughout the signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Are uGLAD? Time will tell!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11647v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We frequently encounter multiple series that are temporally correlated in our surroundings, such as EEG data to examine alterations in brain activity or sensors to monitor body movements. Segmentation of multivariate time series data is a technique for identifying meaningful patterns or changes in the time series that can signal a shift in the system's behavior. However, most segmentation algorithms have been designed primarily for univariate time series, and their performance on multivariate data remains largely unsatisfactory, making this a challenging problem. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for multivariate time series segmentation using conditional independence (CI) graphs. CI graphs are probabilistic graphical models that represents the partial correlations between the nodes. We propose a domain agnostic multivariate segmentation framework $\texttt{tGLAD}$ which draws a parallel between the CI graph nodes and the variables of the time series. Consider applying a graph recovery model $\texttt{uGLAD}$ to a short interval of the time series, it will result in a CI graph that shows partial correlations among the variables. We extend this idea to the entire time series by utilizing a sliding window to create a batch of time intervals and then run a single $\texttt{uGLAD}$ model in multitask learning mode to recover all the CI graphs simultaneously. As a result, we obtain a corresponding temporal CI graphs representation. We then designed a first-order and second-order based trajectory tracking algorithms to study the evolution of these graphs across distinct intervals. Finally, an `Allocation' algorithm is used to determine a suitable segmentation of the temporal graph sequence. $\texttt{tGLAD}$ provides a competitive time complexity of $O(N)$ for settings where number of variables $D<<N$. We demonstrate successful empirical results on a Physical Activity Monitoring data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias correction of quadratic spectral estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12386v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The three cardinal, statistically consistent, families of non-parametric estimators to the power spectral density of a time series are lag-window, multitaper and Welch estimators. However, when estimating power spectral densities from a finite sample each can be subject to non-ignorable bias. Astfalck et al. (2024) developed a method that offers significant bias reduction for finite samples for Welch's estimator, which this article extends to the larger family of quadratic estimators, thus offering similar theory for bias correction of lag-window and multitaper estimators as well as combinations thereof. Importantly, this theory may be used in conjunction with any and all tapers and lag-sequences designed for bias reduction, and so should be seen as an extension to valuable work in these fields, rather than a supplanting methodology. The order of computation is larger than O(n log n) typical in spectral analyses, but not insurmountable in practice. Simulation studies support the theory with comparisons across variations of quadratic estimators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Biometrika, Miscelanea</p></details> |

Specifically, we propose a quadratic-form cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic to test the stability of regression coefficients in high-dimensional linear models. The test controls type-I error at any desired level and is robust to temporally dependent observations. We establish its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis, and demonstrate that it is asymptotically powerful against multiple change-point alternatives and achieves the optimal detection boundary for a wide class of high-dimensional models. We further develop an adaptive procedure to estimate the tuning parameters of the test, making our method practical in applications. Additionally, we extend our approach to localize change-points in the regression time series and establish sharp error bounds for our change-point estimator. Extensive numerical experiments and a real data application in macroeconomics are conducted to demonstrate the promising performance and practical utility of the proposed test.</p></details> |  |
| **[QIXAI: A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Enhancing Classical and Quantum Model Transparency and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16537v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive performance of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is often hindered by their lack of interpretability, rendering them "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where trust and accountability are crucial. This paper introduces the QIXAI Framework (Quantum-Inspired Explainable AI), a novel approach for enhancing neural network interpretability through quantum-inspired techniques. By utilizing principles from quantum mechanics, such as Hilbert spaces, superposition, entanglement, and eigenvalue decomposition, the QIXAI framework reveals how different layers of neural networks process and combine features to make decisions. We critically assess model-agnostic methods like SHAP and LIME, as well as techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), highlighting their limitations in providing a comprehensive view of neural network operations. The QIXAI framework overcomes these limitations by offering deeper insights into feature importance, inter-layer dependencies, and information propagation. A CNN for malaria parasite detection is used as a case study to demonstrate how quantum-inspired methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Mutual Information (MI) provide interpretable explanations of model behavior. Additionally, we explore the extension of QIXAI to other architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, and its application to generative models and time-series analysis. The framework applies to both quantum and classical systems, demonstrating its potential to improve interpretability and transparency across a range of models, advancing the broader goal of developing trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Forecasts are useful to state government agencies to properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses effectively. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of EMS opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for each month. A variety of additional covariates were tested to determine their impact on the model's performance. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to optimize training time and accuracy. Our results show that when special precautions are taken to address data sparsity, useful predictions can be generated with limited error by utilizing yearly trends and covariance with additional data sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-TS Integrator: Integrating LLM for Enhanced Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16489v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series~(TS) modeling is essential in dynamic systems like weather prediction and anomaly detection. Recent studies utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for TS modeling, leveraging their powerful pattern recognition capabilities. These methods primarily position LLMs as the predictive backbone, often omitting the mathematical modeling within traditional TS models, such as periodicity. However, disregarding the potential of LLMs also overlooks their pattern recognition capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{LLM-TS Integrator}, a novel framework that effectively integrates the capabilities of LLMs into traditional TS modeling. Central to this integration is our \textit{mutual information} module. The core of this \textit{mutual information} module is a traditional TS model enhanced with LLM-derived insights for improved predictive abilities. This enhancement is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between traditional model's TS representations and LLM's textual representation counterparts, bridging the two modalities. Moreover, we recognize that samples vary in importance for two losses: traditional prediction and mutual information maximization. To address this variability, we introduce the \textit{sample reweighting} module to improve information utilization. This module assigns dual weights to each sample: one for prediction loss and another for mutual information loss, dynamically optimizing these weights via bi-level optimization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across five mainstream TS tasks, including short-term and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

The outbreak of such diseases can pose a significant threat to human health. However, early detection and tracking of these outbreaks have the potential to reduce the mortality impact. To address these threats, public health authorities have endeavored to establish comprehensive mechanisms for collecting disease data. Many countries have implemented infectious disease surveillance systems, with the detection of epidemics being a primary objective. The clinical healthcare system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional groups, and collaborating governmental entities all play pivotal roles within this system. Moreover, nowadays, search engines and social media platforms can serve as valuable tools for monitoring disease trends. The Internet and social media have become significant platforms where users share information about their preferences and relationships. This real-time information can be harnessed to gauge the influence of ideas and societal opinions, making it highly useful across various domains and research areas, such as marketing campaigns, financial predictions, and public health, among others. This article provides a review of the existing standard methods developed by researchers for detecting outbreaks using time series data. These methods leverage various data sources, including conventional data sources and social media data or Internet data sources. The review particularly concentrates on works published within the timeframe of 2015 to 2022.</p></details> | 40 pages, 2 figures |

Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite some progress, research on predicting future anomalies is still relatively scarce. Predicting anomalies is particularly challenging due to the diverse reaction time and the lack of labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRC to integrate reconstructive and contrastive learning for joint learning of anomaly prediction and detection, with multi-scale structure and adaptive dominant period mask to deal with the diverse reaction time. MultiRC also generates negative samples to provide essential training momentum for the anomaly prediction tasks and prevent model degradation. We evaluate seven benchmark datasets from different fields. For both anomaly prediction and detection tasks, MultiRC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In particular, this method can be used to estimate the state of a dynamical system from observational data gathered by sensors. However, when the number of observations are limited, DEIM returns large estimation errors. Sparse DEIM (S-DEIM) was recently developed to address this problem by introducing a kernel vector which previous DEIM-based methods had ignored. Unfortunately, estimating the optimal kernel vector in S-DEIM is a difficult task. Here, we introduce a data-driven method to estimate this kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this machine learning approach together with S-DEIM leads to nearly optimal state estimations.</p></details> |  |

The main problem in this scenario is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., training models with new samples inevitably leads to the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Among existing methods, the replay-based methods achieve satisfactory performance but compromise privacy, while exemplar-free methods protect privacy but suffer from low accuracy. However, more critically, owing to their reliance on gradient-based update techniques, these existing methods fundamentally cannot solve the catastrophic forgetting problem. In TSC scenarios with continuously arriving data and temporally shifting distributions, these methods become even less practical. In this paper, we propose a Time Series Analytic Continual Learning framework, called TS-ACL. Inspired by analytical learning, TS-ACL transforms neural network updates into gradient-free linear regression problems, thereby fundamentally mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, employing a pre-trained and frozen feature extraction encoder, TS-ACL only needs to update its analytic classifier recursively in a lightweight manner that is highly suitable for real-time applications and large-scale data processing. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate that the model obtained recursively through the TS-ACL is exactly equivalent to a model trained on the complete dataset in a centralized manner, thereby establishing the property of absolute knowledge memory. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our TS-ACL.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Prior research on developing deep learning models for time-series forecasting has often concentrated on isolated aspects, such as long-term point forecasting or short-term probabilistic estimations. This narrow focus may result in skewed methodological choices and hinder the adaptability of these models to uncharted scenarios. While there is a rising trend in developing universal forecasting models, a thorough understanding of their advantages and drawbacks, especially regarding essential forecasting needs like point and distributional forecasts across short and long horizons, is still lacking. In this paper, we present ProbTS, a benchmark tool designed as a unified platform to evaluate these fundamental forecasting needs and to conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of numerous cutting-edge studies from recent years. We dissect the distinctive data characteristics arising from disparate forecasting requirements and elucidate how these characteristics can skew methodological preferences in typical research trajectories, which often fail to fully accommodate essential forecasting needs. Building on this, we examine the latest models for universal time-series forecasting and discover that our analyses of methodological strengths and weaknesses are also applicable to these universal models. Finally, we outline the limitations inherent in current research and underscore several avenues for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |

Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which underline feature or temporal importance, often require expert knowledge. In contrast, natural language explanations (NLEs) are more accessible to laypeople. However, evaluating forecast NLEs is difficult due to the complex causal relationships in time series data. To address this, we introduce two new performance metrics based on simulatability, assessing how well a human surrogate can predict model forecasts using the explanations. Experiments show these metrics differentiate good from poor explanations and align with human judgments. Utilizing these metrics, we further evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for time series data, finding that numerical reasoning, rather than model size, is the main factor influencing explanation quality.</p></details> |  |

Yet, ITS often relies on data from traffic sensors or vehicle devices, where certain cities might not have all those smart devices or enabling infrastructures. Also, recent studies have employed meta-learning to generalize spatial-temporal traffic networks, utilizing data from multiple cities for effective traffic forecasting for data-scarce target cities. However, collecting data from multiple cities can be costly and time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Single Source Meta-Transfer Learning (SSMT) which relies only on a single source city for traffic prediction. Our method harnesses this transferred knowledge to enable few-shot traffic forecasting, particularly when the target city possesses limited data. Specifically, we use memory-augmented attention to store the heterogeneous spatial knowledge from the source city and selectively recall them for the data-scarce target city. We extend the idea of sinusoidal positional encoding to establish meta-learning tasks by leveraging diverse temporal traffic patterns from the source city. Moreover, to capture a more generalized representation of the positions we introduced a meta-positional encoding that learns the most optimal representation of the temporal pattern across all the tasks. We experiment on five real-world benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing methods in time series traffic prediction.</p></details> | ICPR 2024 |
| **[changepointGA: An R package for Fast Changepoint Detection via Genetic Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15571v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genetic algorithm (GA) are stochastic search techniques designed to address combinatorial optimization problems by mimicking the principles of natural selection and evolution. GAs have proven effective in both single and multiple changepoint analyses within time series data, where each chromosome encodes the hyperparameters, number, and locations of changepoints, along with the associated model parameters. Starting with a population of potential changepoint configurations, GAs utilize genetic operators -- selection, crossover, and mutation -- to evolve toward solutions with enhanced fitness. This paper presents the R package changepointGA, which encodes changepoint chromosomes in an integer format. Furthermore, changepointGA facilitates the dynamic and simultaneous estimation of changepoint models hyperparameters, changepoint configurations, and model parameters, leading to more robust and accurate analyses. Several simulation studies and real-world applications are discussed to illustrate the package capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Gasoline Consumption Forecasting: A Novel Hybrid Model Integrating Transformers, LSTM, and CNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16336v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iran, endowed with abundant hydrocarbon resources, plays a crucial role in the global energy landscape. Gasoline, as a critical fuel, significantly supports the nation's transportation sector. Accurate forecasting of gasoline consumption is essential for strategic resource management and environmental planning. This research introduces a novel approach to predicting monthly gasoline consumption using a hybrid Transformer-LSTM-CNN model, which integrates the strengths of Transformer networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This advanced architecture offers a superior alternative to conventional methods such as artificial neural networks and regression models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies in time series data. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of Transformers, the temporal memory of LSTMs, and the local pattern detection of CNNs, our hybrid model delivers improved prediction accuracy. Implemented using Python, the model provides precise future gasoline consumption forecasts and evaluates the environmental impact through the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines gasoline consumption trends from 2007 to 2021, which rose from 64.5 million liters per day in 2007 to 99.80 million liters per day in 2021. Our proposed model forecasts consumption levels up to 2031, offering a valuable tool for policymakers and energy analysts. The results highlight the superiority of this hybrid model in improving the accuracy of gasoline consumption forecasts, reinforcing the need for advanced machine learning techniques to optimize resource management and mitigate environmental risks in the energy sector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomization Inference for Before-and-After Studies with Multiple Units: An Application to a Criminal Procedure Reform in Uruguay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15477v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the immediate impact of a new code of criminal procedure on crime. In November 2017, Uruguay switched from an inquisitorial system (where a single judge leads the investigation and decides the appropriate punishment for a particular crime) to an adversarial system (where the investigation is now led by prosecutors and the judge plays an overseeing role). To analyze the short-term effects of this reform, we develop a randomization-based approach for before-and-after studies with multiple units. Our framework avoids parametric time series assumptions and eliminates extrapolation by basing statistical inferences on finite-sample methods that rely only on the time periods closest to the time of the policy intervention. A key identification assumption underlying our method is that there would have been no time trends in the absence of the intervention, which is most plausible in a small window around the time of the reform. We also discuss several falsification methods to assess the plausibility of this assumption. Using our proposed inferential approach, we find statistically significant short-term causal effects of the crime reform. Our unbiased estimate shows an average increase of approximately 25 police reports per day in the week following the implementation of the new adversarial system in Montevideo, representing an 8 percent increase compared to the previous week under the old system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Sub-Image Search For Variable-Size Patches Identification Based On Virtual Time Series Transformation And Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15425v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses two tasks: (i) fixed-size objects such as hay bales are to be identified in an aerial image for a given reference image of the object, and (ii) variable-size patches such as areas on fields requiring spot spraying or other handling are to be identified in an image for a given small-scale reference image. Both tasks are related. The second differs in that identified sub-images similar to the reference image are further clustered before patches contours are determined by solving a traveling salesman problem. Both tasks are complex in that the exact number of similar sub-images is not known a priori. The main discussion of this paper is presentation of an acceleration mechanism for sub-image search that is based on a transformation of an image to multivariate time series along the RGB-channels and subsequent segmentation to reduce the 2D search space in the image. Two variations of the acceleration mechanism are compared to exhaustive search on diverse synthetic and real-world images. Quantitatively, proposed method results in solve time reductions of up to 2 orders of magnitude, while qualitatively delivering comparative visual results. Proposed method is neural network-free and does not use any image pre-processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Contrastive Learning for Time Series Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15416v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding events in time series is an important task in a variety of contexts. However, human analysis and labeling are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is advantageous to learn embeddings for moments in time series in an unsupervised way, which allows for good performance in classification or detection tasks after later minimal human labeling. In this paper, we propose dynamic contrastive learning (DynaCL), an unsupervised contrastive representation learning framework for time series that uses temporal adjacent steps to define positive pairs. DynaCL adopts N-pair loss to dynamically treat all samples in a batch as positive or negative pairs, enabling efficient training and addressing the challenges of complicated sampling of positives. We demonstrate that DynaCL embeds instances from time series into semantically meaningful clusters, which allows superior performance on downstream tasks on a variety of public time series datasets. Our findings also reveal that high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics do not guarantee that the representations are useful in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Singular Value Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03619v2)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous functional data are commonly seen in time series and longitudinal data analysis. To capture the statistical structures of such data, we propose the framework of Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), a unified framework with structure-adaptive interpretability for the analysis of heterogeneous functional data. We establish the mathematical foundation of FSVD by proving its existence and providing its fundamental properties using operator theory. We then develop an implementation approach for noisy and irregularly observed functional data based on a novel joint kernel ridge regression scheme and provide theoretical guarantees for its convergence and estimation accuracy. The framework of FSVD also introduces the concepts of intrinsic basis functions and intrinsic basis vectors, which represent two fundamental statistical structures for random functions and connect FSVD to various tasks including functional principal component analysis, factor models, functional clustering, and functional completion. We compare the performance of FSVD with existing methods in several tasks through extensive simulation studies. To demonstrate the value of FSVD in real-world datasets, we apply it to extract temporal patterns from a COVID-19 case count dataset and perform data completion on an electronic health record dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More literature review added</p></details> |

In the last three years, hundreds of papers and over fifty new deep-learning models have been described for time series models. These mainly focus on the key aspect of time dependence, whereas in some scientific time series, the situation is more complex with multiple locations, each location having multiple observed and target time-dependent streams and multiple exogenous (known) properties that are either constant or time-dependent. Here, we analyze the hydrology time series using the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets on catchment rainfall and runoff. Together, these have up to 6 observed streams and up to 209 static parameters defined at each of about 8000 locations. This analysis is fully open source with a Jupyter Notebook running on Google Colab for both an LSTM-based analysis and the data engineering preprocessing. Our goal is to investigate the importance of exogenous data, which we look at using eight different choices on representative hydrology tasks. Increasing the exogenous information significantly improves the data representation, with the mean square error decreasing to 60% of its initial value in the largest dataset examined. We present the initial results of studies of other deep-learning neural network architectures where the approaches that can use the full observed and exogenous observations outperform less flexible methods, including Foundation models. Using the natural annual periodic exogenous time series produces the largest impact, but the static and other periodic exogenous streams are also important. Our analysis is intended to be valuable as an educational resource and benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Future-Guided Learning: A Predictive Approach To Enhance Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15217v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time-series forecasting is essential across a multitude of scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle with challenges such as capturing long-term dependencies and adapting to drift in data distributions over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our approach involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on present data. When discrepancies arise between the forecasting and detection models, the forecasting model undergoes more substantial updates, effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data distribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes. This feedback loop, drawing upon principles of predictive coding, enables the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters, improving accuracy by focusing on features that remain relevant despite changes in the underlying data. We validate our method on a variety of tasks such as seizure prediction in biomedical signal analysis and forecasting in dynamical systems, achieving a 40\% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and a 10\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE), respectively. By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism that adapts to data distribution drift, Future-Guided Learning offers a promising avenue for advancing time-series forecasting with deep learning.</p></details> |  |

To address this, hyperspectral data from specialized cameras can be very useful in addition to RGB images. However, due to hardware constraints, high spectral data often come with lower spatial resolution. Additionally, incorporating such data into a learning-based segmentation framework is challenging due to the numerous data channels involved. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an innovative Siamese framework that uses time series-based compression to effectively and scalably integrate the additional spectral data into the segmentation task. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness through competitive benchmarks on aerial datasets in various environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP) 2024.

In this paper, we propose a targeted method that incorporates the clinical domain knowledge into LLMs to improve their ability to detect anomalies. We introduce the Metabolism Pathway-driven Prompting (MPP) method, which integrates the information about metabolic pathways to better capture the structural and temporal changes in biological samples. We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</p></details> |  |

LCGA summarizes similar patterns of change over time into a few distinct categories called trajectory groups, which are then included as "treatments" in the MSM. MSMs are a class of causal models that correctly handle treatment-confounder feedback. The parameters of LCGA-MSMs can be consistently estimated using different estimators, such as inverse probability weighting (IPW), g-computation, and pooled longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (pooled LTMLE). These three estimators of the parameters of LCGA-MSMs are currently implemented in our package. In the context of a time-dependent outcome, we previously proposed a combination of LCGA and history-restricted MSMs (LCGA-HRMSMs). Our package provides additional functions to estimate the parameters of such models. Version 0.1.3 of the package is currently available on CRAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

The inherent indeterminacy of human behavior and complex social interaction among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than common time-series forecasting. In this letter, we aim to explore a distinct formulation for multi-agent trajectory prediction framework. Specifically, we proposed a patching-based temporal feature extraction module and a graph-based social feature extraction module, enabling effective feature extraction and cross-scenario generalization. Moreover, we reassess the role of social interaction and present a novel method based on explicit modality modulation to integrate temporal and social features, thereby constructing an efficient single-stage inference pipeline. Results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v5)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> |  |

Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories.

These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

| **[PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-based Multiagent Trajectory Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10060v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

| **[Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16710v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human mobility trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16096v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur long periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

In practice, different driving scenarios present varying levels of difficulty for trajectory prediction models. However, most existing research focuses on the average precision of prediction results, while ignoring the underlying distribution of the input scenarios. This paper proposes a critical example mining method that utilizes a data-driven approach to estimate the rareness of the trajectories. By combining the rareness estimation of observations with whole trajectories, the proposed method effectively identifies a subset of data that is relatively hard to predict BEFORE feeding them to a specific prediction model. The experimental results show that the mined subset has higher prediction error when applied to different downstream prediction models, which reaches +108.1% error (greater than two times compared to the average on dataset) when mining 5% samples. Further analysis indicates that the mined critical examples include uncommon cases such as sudden brake and cancelled lane-change, which helps to better understand and improve the performance of prediction models.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |
| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally From An Ongoing Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. The results demonstrated the significant superiority of the proposed methods over the baselines in terms of the closed-loop metrics.

| **[Deep Active Learning with Manifold-preserving Trajectory Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15605v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) is for optimizing the selection of unlabeled data for annotation (labeling), aiming to enhance model performance while minimizing labeling effort. The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The trajectory planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is formulated as a game with coupled safety constraints. We then define interaction-fair trajectories and prove that they correspond to the variational equilibrium (VE) of this game. We propose a semi-decentralized planner for the vehicles to seek VE-based fair trajectories, which can significantly improve computational efficiency through parallel computing among CAVs and enhance the safety of planned trajectories by ensuring equilibrium concordance among CAVs. Finally, experimental results show the advantages of the approach, including fast computation speed, high scalability, equilibrium concordance, and safety.</p></details> |  |

The driving risk can be quantified as the product of the probability that an event (such as collision) will occur and the consequence of that event. However, the probability of events occurring is often difficult to predict due to the uncertainty of drivers' or vehicles' behavior. Traditional methods generally employ kinematic-based approaches to predict the future trajectories of entities, which often yield unrealistic prediction results. In this paper, the Enhanced Driving Risk Field (EDRF) model is proposed, integrating deep learning-based multimodal trajectory prediction results with Gaussian distribution models to quantitatively capture the uncertainty of traffic entities' behavior. The applications of the EDRF are also proposed. It is applied across various tasks (traffic risk monitoring, ego-vehicle risk analysis, and motion and trajectory planning) through the defined concept Interaction Risk (IR). Adequate example scenarios are provided for each application to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.</p></details> |  |

| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIMformer: Single-Layer Vanilla Transformer Can Learn Free-Space Trajectory Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14629v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-space trajectory similarity calculation, e.g., DTW, Hausdorff, and Frechet, often incur quadratic time complexity, thus learning-based methods have been proposed to accelerate the computation. The core idea is to train an encoder to transform trajectories into representation vectors and then compute vector similarity to approximate the ground truth. However, existing methods face dual challenges of effectiveness and efficiency: 1) they all utilize Euclidean distance to compute representation similarity, which leads to the severe curse of dimensionality issue -- reducing the distinguishability among representations and significantly affecting the accuracy of subsequent similarity search tasks; 2) most of them are trained in triplets manner and often necessitate additional information which downgrades the efficiency; 3) previous studies, while emphasizing the scalability in terms of efficiency, overlooked the deterioration of effectiveness when the dataset size grows. To cope with these issues, we propose a simple, yet accurate, fast, scalable model that only uses a single-layer vanilla transformer encoder as the feature extractor and employs tailored representation similarity functions to approximate various ground truth similarity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly mitigates the curse of dimensionality issue and outperforms the state-of-the-arts in effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, issues such as service interruptions and network instability often lead to sparsely recorded trajectories, resulting in a loss of detailed movement data. As a result, recovering these trajectories to restore missing information becomes essential. Despite progress, several challenges remain unresolved. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data hampers the performance of existing deep learning methods, which rely heavily on abundant data for supervised training. Second, current methods struggle to generalize across sparse trajectories with varying sampling intervals, necessitating separate re-training for each interval and increasing computational costs. Third, external factors crucial for the recovery of missing points are not fully incorporated. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called PTR. This framework mitigates the issue of limited dense trajectory data by leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). PTR incorporates an explicit trajectory prompt and is trained on datasets with multiple sampling intervals, enabling it to generalize effectively across different intervals in sparse trajectories. To capture external factors, we introduce an implicit trajectory prompt that models road conditions, providing richer information for recovering missing points. Additionally, we present a trajectory embedder that encodes trajectory points and transforms the embeddings of both observed and missing points into a format comprehensible to PLMs. Experimental results on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of PTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Enhanced Multi-View Trajectory Representation Learning: Bridging the Gap through Self-Supervised Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13196v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling trajectory data with generic-purpose dense representations has become a prevalent paradigm for various downstream applications, such as trajectory classification, travel time estimation and similarity computation. However, existing methods typically rely on trajectories from a single spatial view, limiting their ability to capture the rich contextual information that is crucial for gaining deeper insights into movement patterns across different geospatial contexts. To this end, we propose MVTraj, a novel multi-view modeling method for trajectory representation learning. MVTraj integrates diverse contextual knowledge, from GPS to road network and points-of-interest to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory data. To align the learning process across multiple views, we utilize GPS trajectories as a bridge and employ self-supervised pretext tasks to capture and distinguish movement patterns across different spatial views. Following this, we treat trajectories from different views as distinct modalities and apply a hierarchical cross-modal interaction module to fuse the representations, thereby enriching the knowledge derived from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MVTraj significantly outperforms existing baselines in tasks associated with various spatial views, validating its effectiveness and practical utility in spatio-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are difficult to realize safe navigation, considering uncertainties, complex environmental structures, and robot swarms. This paper introduces an extended state model predictive control planner with a safe probability field to address the multi-robot navigation problem in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Initially, the safe probability field offers an innovative approach to model the uncertainty of external dynamic obstacles, combining it with an unconstrained optimization method to generate safe trajectories for multi-robot online. Subsequently, the extended state model predictive controller can accurately track these generated trajectories while considering the robots' inherent model constraints and state uncertainty, thus ensuring the practical feasibility of the planned trajectories. Simulation experiments show a success rate four times higher than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Physical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to operate in real-time, enabling safe navigation for multi-robot in uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Truncating Trajectories in Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation: an Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13463v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy evaluation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is at the core of many MC Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (e.g., policy gradient methods). In this context, the designer of the learning system specifies an interaction budget that the agent usually spends by collecting trajectories of fixed length within a simulator. However, is this data collection strategy the best option? To answer this question, in this paper, we propose as a quality index a surrogate of the mean squared error of a return estimator that uses trajectories of different lengths, i.e., \emph{truncated}. Specifically, this surrogate shows the sub-optimality of the fixed-length trajectory schedule. Furthermore, it suggests that adaptive data collection strategies that spend the available budget sequentially can allocate a larger portion of transitions in timesteps in which more accurate sampling is required to reduce the error of the final estimate. Building on these findings, we present an adaptive algorithm called Robust and Iterative Data collection strategy Optimization (RIDO). The main intuition behind RIDO is to split the available interaction budget into mini-batches. At each round, the agent determines the most convenient schedule of trajectories that minimizes an empirical and robust version of the surrogate of the estimator's error. After discussing the theoretical properties of our method, we conclude by assessing its performance across multiple domains. Our results show that RIDO can adapt its trajectory schedule toward timesteps where more sampling is required to increase the quality of the final estimation.</p></details> |  |

Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive "pseudo-bearing" measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness. To validate our approach, we derived the optimal rotation speed and conducted extensive simulations and field missions with our GyroCopter to track and localize multiple RF sources. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential as a practical and rapid solution for RF source localization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For a demonstration video, see https://youtu.be/OkmmQjD74Us</p></details> |

However, existing approaches only operate on static structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic in nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models (GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of 3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it requires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical symmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We theoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels can lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition kernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention. Furthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional generation, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the forward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in various scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate that GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly higher quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024. 29 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

| **[How does Your RL Agent Explore? An Optimal Transport Analysis of Occupancy Measure Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09113v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising successes of RL are propelled by combining smart algorithmic strategies and deep architectures to optimize the distribution of returns and visitations over the state-action space. A quantitative framework to compare the learning processes of these eclectic RL algorithms is currently absent but desired in practice. We address this gap by representing the learning process of an RL algorithm as a sequence of policies generated during training, and then studying the policy trajectory induced in the manifold of state-action occupancy measures. Using an optimal transport-based metric, we measure the length of the paths induced by the policy sequence yielded by an RL algorithm between an initial policy and a final optimal policy. Hence, we first define the 'Effort of Sequential Learning' (ESL). ESL quantifies the relative distance that an RL algorithm travels compared to the shortest path from the initial to the optimal policy. Further, we connect the dynamics of policies in the occupancy measure space and regret (another metric to understand the suboptimality of an RL algorithm), by defining the 'Optimal Movement Ratio' (OMR). OMR assesses the fraction of movements in the occupancy measure space that effectively reduce an analogue of regret. Finally, we derive approximation guarantees to estimate ESL and OMR with finite number of samples and without access to an optimal policy. Through empirical analyses across various environments and algorithms, we demonstrate that ESL and OMR provide insights into the exploration processes of RL algorithms and hardness of different tasks in discrete and continuous MDPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Manifold Optimization for Fast and Adaptive Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12193v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast kinodynamic motion planning is crucial for systems to effectively adapt to dynamically changing environments. Despite some efforts, existing approaches still struggle with rapid planning in high-dimensional, complex problems. Not surprisingly, the primary challenge arises from the high-dimensionality of the search space, specifically the trajectory space. We address this issue with a two-step method: initially, we identify a lower-dimensional trajectory manifold {\it offline}, comprising diverse trajectories specifically relevant to the task at hand while meeting kinodynamic constraints. Subsequently, we search for solutions within this manifold {\it online}, significantly enhancing the planning speed. To encode and generate a manifold of continuous-time, differentiable trajectories, we propose a novel neural network model, {\it Differentiable Motion Manifold Primitives (DMMP)}, along with a practical training strategy. Experiments with a 7-DoF robot arm tasked with dynamic throwing to arbitrary target positions demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in planning speed, task success, and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an appealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively combining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current approaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed, single-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle positions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances. However, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently reconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical solution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation framework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging high-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal data sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural network models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both scene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and trajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via multimodal representations. The transformer network then generates near-optimal initial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing convergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 80% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to traditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenario variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to 2025 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.

| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contour Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures.

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines the Dreamer algorithm's ability to generate anticipatory trajectories with the adaptive learning strengths of the Online Decision Transformer. Our methodology enables parallel training where Dreamer-produced trajectories enhance the contextual decision-making of the transformer, creating a bidirectional enhancement loop. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a suite of challenging benchmarks, achieving notable improvements in sample efficiency and reward maximization over existing methods. Our results indicate that the proposed integrated framework not only accelerates learning but also showcases robustness in diverse and dynamic scenarios, marking a significant step forward in model-based reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as inpreceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing control methods still face two limitations: Firstly, control conditions (such as depth maps, 3D Mesh) are difficult for ordinary users to obtain directly. Secondly, it's challenging to drive multiple objects through complex motions with multiple trajectories simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce DragEntity, a video generation model that utilizes entity representation for controlling the motion of multiple objects. Compared to previous methods, DragEntity offers two main advantages: 1) Our method is more user-friendly for interaction because it allows users to drag entities within the image rather than individual pixels. 2) We use entity representation to represent any object in the image, and multiple objects can maintain relative spatial relationships. Therefore, we allow multiple trajectories to control multiple objects in the image with different levels of complexity simultaneously. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of DragEntity, demonstrating its excellent performance in fine-grained control in video generation.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 Oral |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, it is not always possible to count probe traffic volume in a spatial dataset when probe trajectories cannot be fully reconstructed from raw probe point location data due to sparse recording intervals, lack of pseudonyms or timestamps. As a result, the application of such probe point location data has been limited in traffic volume estimation. To relax these constraints, we present the exact distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume in a road segment based on probe point location data without trajectory reconstruction. The distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume can exhibit multimodality, without necessarily being line-symmetric with respect to the true probe traffic volume. As more probes are present, the distribution approaches a normal distribution. The conformity of the distribution was visualised through numerical simulations. Sometimes, there exists a local optimal cordon length that maximises estimation precision. The theoretical variance of estimated probe traffic volume can address heteroscedasticity in the modelling of traffic volume estimates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Here we examine a zoo of diffusion-based inpainting methods on a specific dataset of corrupted images, which represent incomplete Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation readily reproduces the built-in correlations of fBm paths in different memory regimes (i.e., for sub-, Brownian and super-diffusion trajectories), providing a robust tool for the statistical imputation at high missing ratio. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to memorize samples from the training database, we demonstrate that diffusion behaves qualitatively different from the database search and thus generalize rather than memorize the training dataset. As a biological application, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model for the imputation of microscopy-derived distance matrices of chromosomal segments (FISH data) - incomplete due to experimental imperfections - and demonstrate its superiority over the standard approaches used in bioinformatics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation. Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and moving-body videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

Conventional stochastic trajectory prediction methods utilize latent variables to represent the multi-modality of vessel motion, however, tends to overlook the complexity and dynamics inherent in maritime behavior. In contrast, we explicitly simulate the transition of vessel motion from uncertainty towards a state of certainty, effectively handling future indeterminacy in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a novel framework (\textit{DiffuTraj}) to conceptualize the trajectory prediction task as a guided reverse process of motion pattern uncertainty diffusion, in which we progressively remove uncertainty from maritime regions to delineate the intended trajectory. Specifically, we encode the previous states of the target vessel, vessel-vessel interactions, and the environment context as guiding factors for trajectory generation. Subsequently, we devise a transformer-based conditional denoiser to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, enabling the generation of trajectories better aligned for particular maritime environment.

This paper explores the indirect method of trajectory optimization, emphasizing its application in creating optimal periodic gaits for legged systems and contrasting it with the more commonly used direct method. While the direct method provides considerable flexibility in its implementation, it is limited by its input space parameterization. In contrast, the indirect method improves accuracy by defining control inputs as functions of the system's states and costates. We tackle the convergence challenges associated with indirect shooting methods, particularly through the systematic development of gait libraries by utilizing numerical continuation methods. Our contributions include: (1) the formalization of a general periodic trajectory optimization problem that extends existing first-order necessary conditions for a broader range of cost functions and operating conditions; (2) a methodology for efficiently generating libraries of optimal trajectories (gaits) utilizing a single shooting approach combined with numerical continuation methods, including a novel approach for reconstructing Lagrange multipliers and costates from passive gaits; and (3) a comparative analysis of the indirect and direct shooting methods using a compass-gait walker as a case study, demonstrating the former's superior accuracy in generating optimal gaits. The findings underscore the potential of the indirect method for generating families of optimal gaits, thereby advancing the field of trajectory optimization in legged robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP) framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, under review</p></details> |

We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |
| **[Encoding Agent Trajectories as Representations with Sequence Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09204v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal data faces many analogous challenges to natural language text including the ordering of locations (words) in a sequence, long range dependencies between locations, and locations having multiple meanings. In this work, we propose a novel model for representing high dimensional spatiotemporal trajectories as sequences of discrete locations and encoding them with a Transformer-based neural network architecture. Similar to language models, our Sequence Transformer for Agent Representation Encodings (STARE) model can learn representations and structure in trajectory data through both supervisory tasks (e.g., classification), and self-supervisory tasks (e.g., masked modelling). We present experimental results on various synthetic and real trajectory datasets and show that our proposed model can learn meaningful encodings that are useful for many downstream tasks including discriminating between labels and indicating similarity between locations. Using these encodings, we also learn relationships between agents and locations present in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to be presented at GeoAI workshop at ACM SigSpatial 2024</p></details> |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning domain/task-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer models? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. By utilizing the pre-trained diffusion as a prior, source domain trajectories can be transformed to match with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process implicitly corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in the source data, and allowing flexible incorporation with various downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |

We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v4)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

Leveraging a novel annotation pipeline, we are able to scale the annotated trajectories and generate a trajectory dataset with minimized difficulty bias. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLMs on AgentBank to get a series of agent models, Samoyed. Our comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of scaling the interaction trajectory data to acquire generalized agent capabilities.

| **[Reliable Probabilistic Human Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06905v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, like vehicles or robots, require reliable, accurate, fast, resource-efficient, scalable, and low-latency trajectory predictions to get initial knowledge about future locations and movements of surrounding objects for safe human-machine interaction. Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keepout constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements. Finally, collaborative control scenarios involving multi-agent space systems are considered to demonstrate the technical merits of the proposed work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE ACC 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |

Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits. We deploy our approach on Husky UGV mobile platform, which move through the office corridors under proposed MPC local trajectory planner.

While prior works mostly rely on human feedback in the form of comparisons, language is a preferable modality that provides more informative insights into user preferences. In this work, we aim to incorporate comparative language feedback to iteratively improve robot trajectories and to learn reward functions that encode human preferences. To achieve this goal, we learn a shared latent space that integrates trajectory data and language feedback, and subsequently leverage the learned latent space to improve trajectories and learn human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate comparative language feedback into reward learning. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned latent space and the success of our learning algorithms. We also conduct human subject studies that show our reward learning algorithm achieves a 23.9% higher subjective score on average and is 11.3% more time-efficient compared to preference-based reward learning, underscoring the superior performance of our method.

In this paper, we study the problem of computing joint torques and grasping forces for time-optimal motion of an object, while ensuring that the grasp is not lost and any constraints on the motion of the object, either due to dynamics, environment contact, or no-slip requirements, are also satisfied. We present a second-order cone program (SOCP) formulation of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem that considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the hand-object and object-environment contacts. Since SOCPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved optimally in polynomial time using interior point methods, we can solve the trajectory optimization problem efficiently. We present simulation results on three examples, including a non-prehensile manipulation task, which shows the generality and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME).

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p></details> |  |

| **[Sparse Decomposition of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19723v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) exhibit superior performance in graph representation learning, but their inference cost can be high, due to an aggregation operation that can require a memory fetch for a very large number of nodes. This inference cost is the major obstacle to deploying GNN models with \emph{online prediction} to reflect the potentially dynamic node features. To address this, we propose an approach to reduce the number of nodes that are included during aggregation. We achieve this through a sparse decomposition, learning to approximate node representations using a weighted sum of linearly transformed features of a carefully selected subset of nodes within the extended neighbourhood. The approach achieves linear complexity with respect to the average node degree and the number of layers in the graph neural network. We introduce an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters for the sparse decomposition, ensuring an accurate approximation of the original GNN model, and present effective strategies to reduce the training time and improve the learning process. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method outperforms other baselines designed for inference speedup, achieving significant accuracy gains with comparable inference times for both node classification and spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeMuVGN: Effective Software Defect Prediction Model by Learning Multi-view Software Dependency via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19550v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software defect prediction (SDP) aims to identify high-risk defect modules in software development, optimizing resource allocation. While previous studies show that dependency network metrics improve defect prediction, most methods focus on code-based dependency graphs, overlooking developer factors. Current metrics, based on handcrafted features like ego and global network metrics, fail to fully capture defect-related information. To address this, we propose DeMuVGN, a defect prediction model that learns multi-view software dependency via graph neural networks. We introduce a Multi-view Software Dependency Graph (MSDG) that integrates data, call, and developer dependencies. DeMuVGN also leverages the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance and enhance defect module identification. In a case study of eight open-source projects across 20 versions, DeMuVGN demonstrates significant improvements: i) models based on multi-view graphs improve F1 scores by 11.1% to 12.1% over single-view models; ii) DeMuVGN improves F1 scores by 17.4% to 45.8% in within-project contexts and by 17.9% to 41.0% in cross-project contexts. Additionally, DeMuVGN excels in software evolution, showing more improvement in later-stage software versions. Its strong performance across different projects highlights its generalizability. We recommend future research focus on multi-view dependency graphs for defect prediction in both mature and newly developed projects.</p></details> |  |

As special cases, we show that R-CBMs are capable of both representing standard CBMs and message-passing GNNs. To evaluate the effectiveness and versatility of these models, we designed a class of experimental problems, ranging from image classification to link prediction in knowledge graphs. In particular we show that R-CBMs (i) match generalization performance of existing relational black-boxes, (ii) support the generation of quantified concept-based explanations, (iii) effectively respond to test-time interventions, and (iv) withstand demanding settings including out-of-distribution scenarios, limited training data regimes, and scarce concept supervisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Enhanced Hierarchical Planning Framework for Multi-Robot Autonomous Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19373v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous exploration of environments by multi-robot systems is a critical task with broad applications in rescue missions, exploration endeavors, and beyond. Current approaches often rely on either greedy frontier selection or end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, yet these methods are frequently hampered by limitations such as short-sightedness, overlooking long-term implications, and convergence difficulties stemming from the intricate high-dimensional learning space. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative integration strategy that combines the low-dimensional action space efficiency of frontier-based methods with the far-sightedness and optimality of DRL-based approaches. We propose a three-tiered planning framework that first identifies frontiers in free space, creating a sparse map representation that lightens data transmission burdens and reduces the DRL action space's dimensionality. Subsequently, we develop a multi-graph neural network (mGNN) that incorporates states of potential targets and robots, leveraging policy-based reinforcement learning to compute affinities, thereby superseding traditional heuristic utility values. Lastly, we implement local routing planning through subsequence search, which avoids exhaustive sequence traversal. Extensive validation across diverse scenarios and comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared to baseline approaches, our framework achieves environmental exploration with fewer time steps and a notable reduction of over 30% in data transmission, showcasing its superiority in terms of efficiency and performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6figures |
| **[Double Difference Earthquake Location with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19323v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Double difference earthquake relocation is an essential component of many earthquake catalog development workflows. This technique produces high-resolution relative relocations between events by minimizing differential measurements of the arrival times of waves from nearby sources, which highlights the resolution of faults and improves interpretation of seismic activity. The inverse problem is typically solved iteratively using conjugate-gradient minimization, however the cost scales significantly with the total number of sources and stations considered. Here we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based earthquake double-difference relocation framework, Graph Double Difference (GraphDD), that is trained to minimize the double-difference residuals of a catalog to locate earthquakes. Through batching and sampling the method can scale to arbitrarily large catalogs. Our architecture uses one graph to represent the stations, a second graph to represent the sources, and creates the Cartesian product graph between the two graphs to capture the relationships between the stations and sources (e.g., the residuals and travel time partial derivatives). This key feature allows a natural architecture that can be used to minimize the double-difference residuals. We implement our model on several distinct test cases including seismicity from northern California, Turkiye, and northern Chile, which have highly variable data quality, and station and source distributions. We obtain high resolution relocations in these tests, and our model shows adaptability to variable types of loss functions and location objectives, including learning station corrections and mapping into the reference frame of a different catalog. Our results suggest that a GNN approach to double-difference relocation is a promising direction for scaling to very large catalogs and gaining new insights into the relocation problem.</p></details> |  |

Information over-squashing in language tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04267v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how information propagates in decoder-only Transformers, which are the architectural backbone of most existing frontier large language models (LLMs). We rely on a theoretical signal propagation analysis -- specifically, we analyse the representations of the last token in the final layer of the Transformer, as this is the representation used for next-token prediction. Our analysis reveals a representational collapse phenomenon: we prove that certain distinct sequences of inputs to the Transformer can yield arbitrarily close representations in the final token. This effect is exacerbated by the low-precision floating-point formats frequently used in modern LLMs. As a result, the model is provably unable to respond to these sequences in different ways -- leading to errors in, e.g., tasks involving counting or copying. Further, we show that decoder-only Transformer language models can lose sensitivity to specific tokens in the input, which relates to the well-known phenomenon of over-squashing in graph neural networks. We provide empirical evidence supporting our claims on contemporary LLMs. Our theory also points to simple solutions towards ameliorating these issues.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies have integrated textual information into propagation networks, they have yet to fully leverage the advancements in Transformer-based language models for high-quality contextual text representations. This work investigates the impact of incorporating textual features into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fake news detection. Our experiments demonstrate that contextual representations improve performance by 9.3% in Macro F1 over static ones and 33.8% over GNNs without textual features. However, noisy data augmentation degrades performance and increases instability. We expect our methodology to open avenues for further research, and all code is made publicly available.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, existing video prediction approaches typically do not explicitly account for the 3D information from videos, such as robot actions and objects' 3D states, limiting their use in real-world robotic applications. In this work, we introduce a framework to learn object dynamics directly from multi-view RGB videos by explicitly considering the robot's action trajectories and their effects on scene dynamics. We utilize the 3D Gaussian representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to train a particle-based dynamics model using Graph Neural Networks. This model operates on sparse control particles downsampled from the densely tracked 3D Gaussian reconstructions. By learning the neural dynamics model on offline robot interaction data, our method can predict object motions under varying initial configurations and unseen robot actions. The 3D transformations of Gaussians can be interpolated from the motions of control particles, enabling the rendering of predicted future object states and achieving action-conditioned video prediction. The dynamics model can also be applied to model-based planning frameworks for object manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments on various kinds of deformable materials, including ropes, clothes, and stuffed animals, demonstrating our framework's ability to model complex shapes and dynamics.

In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient data-driven approach to accelerate the generation of effective preconditioners. We, therefore, replace the typically hand-engineered preconditioners by the output of graph neural networks. Our method generates an incomplete factorization of the matrix and is, therefore, referred to as neural incomplete factorization (NeuralIF). Optimizing the condition number of the linear system directly is computationally infeasible. Instead, we utilize a stochastic approximation of the Frobenius loss which only requires matrix-vector multiplications for efficient training. At the core of our method is a novel message-passing block, inspired by sparse matrix theory, that aligns with the objective of finding a sparse factorization of the matrix. We evaluate our proposed method on both synthetic problem instances and on problems arising from the discretization of the Poisson equation on varying domains. Our experiments show that by using data-driven preconditioners within the conjugate gradient method we are able to speed up the convergence of the iterative procedure.

| **[Leveraging Graph Neural Networks and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Control in Supply Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18631v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inventory control in modern supply chains has attracted significant attention due to the increasing number of disruptive shocks and the challenges posed by complex dynamics, uncertainties, and limited collaboration. Traditional methods, which often rely on static parameters, struggle to adapt to changing environments. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for state representation to address these limitations. Our approach redefines the action space by parameterizing heuristic inventory control policies, making it adaptive as the parameters dynamically adjust based on system conditions. By leveraging the inherent graph structure of supply chains, our framework enables agents to learn the system's topology, and we employ a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme that allows agents to learn collaboratively while overcoming information-sharing constraints. Additionally, we incorporate global mean pooling and regularization techniques to enhance performance. We test the capabilities of our proposed approach on four different supply chain configurations and conduct a sensitivity analysis. This work paves the way for utilizing MARL-GNN frameworks to improve inventory management in complex, decentralized supply chain environments.</p></details> |  |

As IoT devices proliferate and rapidly evolve, their highly heterogeneous hardware architectures and complex compilation settings, coupled with the demand for large-scale function retrieval in practical applications, put forward higher requirements for BCSD methods. In this paper, we propose IRBinDiff, which mitigates compilation differences by leveraging LLVM-IR with higher-level semantic abstraction, and integrates a pre-trained language model with a graph neural network to capture both semantic and structural information from different perspectives. By introducing momentum contrastive learning, it effectively enhances retrieval capabilities in large-scale candidate function sets, distinguishing between subtle function similarities and differences. Our extensive experiments, conducted under varied compilation settings, demonstrate that IRBinDiff outperforms other leading BCSD methods in both One-to-one comparison and One-to-many search scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

The effectiveness of existing GNNs in GAD has been mainly attributed to the simultaneous learning of node representations and the classifier in an end-to-end manner. Meanwhile, graph pre-training, the two-stage learning paradigm such as DGI and GraphMAE, has shown potential in leveraging unlabeled graph data to enhance downstream tasks, yet its impact on GAD remains under-explored. In this work, we show that graph pre-training models are strong graph anomaly detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that pre-training is highly competitive, markedly outperforming the state-of-the-art end-to-end training models when faced with limited supervision. To understand this phenomenon, we further uncover pre-training enhances the detection of distant, under-represented, unlabeled anomalies that go beyond 2-hop neighborhoods of known anomalies, shedding light on its superior performance against end-to-end models. Moreover, we extend our examination to the potential of pre-training in graph-level anomaly detection. We envision this work to stimulate a re-evaluation of pre-training's role in GAD and offer valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretability enhancement procedure for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. Given a black-box baseline GNN model, the end result is an interpretable GNN model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures identified by the interpretable GNNs are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the interpretable GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers, with geometry extrapolations demonstrated for ramp and wall-mounted cube configurations.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference process is often not easily interpretable. Current explanation techniques are limited to understanding Graph Neural Network (GNN) behaviors in classification tasks, leaving an explanation gap for graph regression models. In this work, we propose a novel explanation method to interpret the graph regression models (XAIG-R). Our method addresses the distribution shifting problem and continuously ordered decision boundary issues that hinder existing methods away from being applied in regression tasks. We introduce a novel objective based on the graph information bottleneck theory (GIB) and a new mix-up framework, which can support various GNNs and explainers in a model-agnostic manner. Additionally, we present a self-supervised learning strategy to tackle the continuously ordered labels in regression tasks. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets and a real-life dataset introduced by us, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in interpreting GNN models in regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems. Our work provides useful recommendations for software, system and hardware designers. PyGim is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/PyGim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient End-to-end Language Model Fine-tuning on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04737v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has attracted significant attention due to its wide range of real-world applications. The rapid evolution of language models (LMs) has revolutionized the way we process textual data, which indicates a strong potential to replace shallow text embedding generally used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, we find that existing LM approaches that exploit text information in graphs suffer from inferior computation and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce LEADING, a novel and efficient approach for end-to-end fine-tuning of language models on TAGs. To enhance data efficiency, LEADING efficiently transfers rich knowledge from LMs to downstream graph learning tasks with limited labeled data by employing end-to-end training of LMs and GNNs in a semi-supervised learning setting. To address associated computation efficiency issues, it introduces two techniques: neighbor decoupling targeting LMs and implicit graph modeling targeting GNNs, respectively. Our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the ogbn-arxiv leaderboard, while maintaining computation cost and memory overhead comparable to graph-less fine-tuning of LMs. Through comprehensive experiments, we showcase its superior computation and data efficiency, presenting a promising solution for various LMs and graph learning tasks on TAGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18032v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

While structure-based methods accurately model physical interactions between a drug and its protein target, cell-based assays such as Cell Painting can better capture complex DTI interactions. This paper introduces MOTIVE, a Morphological cOmpound Target Interaction Graph dataset comprising Cell Painting features for 11,000 genes and 3,600 compounds, along with their relationships extracted from seven publicly available databases. We provide random, cold-source (new drugs), and cold-target (new genes) data splits to enable rigorous evaluation under realistic use cases. Our benchmark results show that graph neural networks that use Cell Painting features consistently outperform those that learn from graph structure alone, feature-based models, and topological heuristics. MOTIVE accelerates both graph ML research and drug discovery by promoting the development of more reliable DTI prediction models.

Conventional GNNs, constructed with the Artificial Neuron Network (ANN), have achieved impressive performance at the cost of high computation and energy consumption. In parallel, spiking GNNs with brain-like spiking neurons are drawing increasing research attention owing to the energy efficiency. So far, existing spiking GNNs consider graphs in Euclidean space, ignoring the structural geometry, and suffer from the high latency issue due to Back-Propagation-Through-Time (BPTT) with the surrogate gradient. In light of the aforementioned issues, we are devoted to exploring spiking GNN on Riemannian manifolds, and present a Manifold-valued Spiking GNN (MSG). In particular, we design a new spiking neuron on geodesically complete manifolds with the diffeomorphism, so that BPTT regarding the spikes is replaced by the proposed differentiation via manifold. Theoretically, we show that MSG approximates a solver of the manifold ordinary differential equation. Extensive experiments on common graphs show the proposed MSG achieves superior performance to previous spiking GNNs and energy efficiency to conventional GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024, 30 pages</p></details> |

Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) represent higher-order structures using simplicial complexes to break this limitation albeit still lacking time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture on simplicial complexes named Binarized Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (Bi-SCNN) based on the combination of simplicial convolution with a binary-sign forward propagation strategy. The usage of the Hodge Laplacian on a binary-sign forward propagation enables Bi-SCNN to efficiently and effectively represent simplicial features that have higher-order structures than traditional graph node representations. Compared to the previous Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks, the reduced model complexity of Bi-SCNN shortens the execution time without sacrificing the prediction performance and is less prone to the over-smoothing effect. Experimenting with real-world citation and ocean-drifter data confirmed that our proposed Bi-SCNN is efficient and accurate.</p></details> |  |

However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, we describe a few-shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.), showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image-driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic-scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self-assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub-models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.</p></details> |  |

Given the heterogeneity and redundancy problems that graph data often have, traditional GNN methods may be overly dependent on the initial structure and attribute information of the graph, which limits their ability to accurately simulate more complex relationships and patterns in the graph. Therefore, this study proposes a graph neural network model under a self-supervised learning framework, which can flexibly combine different types of additional information of the attribute graph and its nodes, so as to better mine the deep features in the graph data. By introducing a self-supervisory mechanism, it is expected to improve the adaptability of existing models to the diversity and complexity of graph data and improve the overall performance of the model.</p></details> |  |

Most existing OOD detection methods on graphs primarily focus on identifying instances in test data domains caused by either semantic shifts (changes in data classes) or covariate shifts (changes in data features), while leaving the simultaneous occurrence of both distribution shifts under-explored. In this work, we address both types of shifts simultaneously and introduce a novel challenge for OOD detection on graphs: graph-level semantic OOD detection under covariate shift. In this scenario, variations between the training and test domains result from the concurrent presence of both covariate and semantic shifts, where only graphs associated with unknown classes are identified as OOD samples (OODs). To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel two-phase framework called Graph Disentangled Diffusion Augmentation (GDDA). The first phase focuses on disentangling graph representations into domain-invariant semantic factors and domain-specific style factors. In the second phase, we introduce a novel distribution-shift-controlled score-based generative diffusion model that generates latent factors outside the training semantic and style spaces. Additionally, auxiliary pseudo-in-distribution (InD) and pseudo-OOD graph representations are employed to enhance the effectiveness of the energy-based semantic OOD detector. Extensive empirical studies on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

We propose Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning (SIGL), a scalable method that combines implicit neural representations (INRs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate a graphon from observed graphs. Unlike existing methods, which face important limitations like fixed resolution and scalability issues, SIGL learns a continuous graphon at arbitrary resolutions. GNNs are used to determine the correct node ordering, improving graph alignment. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic consistency of our estimator, showing that more expressive INRs and GNNs lead to consistent estimators. We evaluate SIGL in synthetic and real-world graphs, showing that it outperforms existing methods and scales effectively to larger graphs, making it ideal for tasks like graph data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

Prior efforts demonstrated that utilizing flexibility from dynamic topologies will improve grid efficiency. However, this will convert the linear OPF into a mixed-integer linear programming network-reconfigured OPF (NR-OPF) problem, substantially increasing the computing time. Thus, a machine learning (ML)-based approach, particularly utilizing graph neural network (GNN), is proposed to accelerate the solution process. The GNN model is trained offline to predict the best topology before entering the optimization stage. In addition, this paper proposes an offline pre-ML filter layer to reduce GNN model size and training time while improving its accuracy. A fast online post-ML selection layer is also proposed to analyze GNN predictions and then select a subset of predicted NR solutions with high confidence. Case studies have demonstrated superior performance of the proposed GNN-accelerated NR-OPF method augmented with the proposed pre-ML and post-ML layers.</p></details> |  |

However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index.

One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a poster at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Graph Rewiring with Expander Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02362v3)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) emerged to model evolutionary behaviour of such graphs by leveraging the message passing primitive at the core of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It is well-known that GNNs are vulnerable to several issues directly related to the input graph topology, such as under-reaching and over-squashing - we argue that these issues can often get exacerbated in temporal graphs, particularly as the result of stale nodes and edges. While graph rewiring techniques have seen frequent usage in GNNs to make the graph topology more favourable for message passing, they have not seen any mainstream usage on TGNNs. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs, to the best of our knowledge. TGR constructs message passing highways between temporally distant nodes in a continuous-time dynamic graph by utilizing expander graph propagation, a prominent framework used for graph rewiring on static graphs which makes minimal assumptions on the underlying graph structure. On the challenging TGB benchmark, TGR achieves state-of-the-art results on tgbl-review, tgbl-coin, tgbl-comment and tgbl-flight datasets at the time of writing. For tgbl-review, TGR has 50.5% improvement in MRR over the base TGN model and 22.2% improvement over the base TNCN model. The significant improvement over base models demonstrates clear benefits of temporal graph rewiring.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Edge Signals: Orientation Equivariance and Invariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16935v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications in traffic, civil engineering, or electrical engineering revolve around edge-level signals. Such signals can be categorized as inherently directed, for example, the water flow in a pipe network, and undirected, like the diameter of a pipe. Topological methods model edge signals with inherent direction by representing them relative to a so-called orientation assigned to each edge. These approaches can neither model undirected edge signals nor distinguish if an edge itself is directed or undirected. We address these shortcomings by (i) revising the notion of orientation equivariance to enable edge direction-aware topological models, (ii) proposing orientation invariance as an additional requirement to describe signals without inherent direction, and (iii) developing EIGN, an architecture composed of novel direction-aware edge-level graph shift operators, that provably fulfills the aforementioned desiderata. It is the first general-purpose topological GNN for edge-level signals that can model directed and undirected signals while distinguishing between directed and undirected edges. A comprehensive evaluation shows that EIGN outperforms prior work in edge-level tasks, for example, improving in RMSE on flow simulation tasks by up to 43.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Message Passing for Glycan Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13467v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glycans are the most complex biological sequence, with monosaccharides forming extended, non-linear sequences. As post-translational modifications, they modulate protein structure, function, and interactions. Due to their diversity and complexity, predictive models of glycan properties and functions are still insufficient. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed to process and analyze graph-structured data. These architectures leverage the connectivity and relational information in graphs to learn effective representations of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. Iteratively aggregating information from neighboring nodes, GNNs capture complex patterns within graph data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as link prediction or graph classification across domains. This work presents a new model architecture based on combinatorial complexes and higher-order message passing to extract features from glycan structures into a latent space representation. The architecture is evaluated on an improved GlycanML benchmark suite, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. We envision that these improvements will spur further advances in computational glycosciences and reveal the roles of glycans in biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MLSB Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[GLBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07457v3)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way we interact with graphs, leading to a new paradigm called GraphLLM. Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols. To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios. The data and code of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/NineAbyss/GLBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic graph neural networks for enhanced volatility prediction in financial markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16858v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volatility forecasting is essential for risk management and decision-making in financial markets. Traditional models like Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) effectively capture volatility clustering but often fail to model complex, non-linear interdependencies between multiple indices. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent global financial markets as dynamic graphs. The Temporal Graph Attention Network (Temporal GAT) combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to capture the temporal and structural dynamics of volatility spillovers. By utilizing correlation-based and volatility spillover indices, the Temporal GAT constructs directed graphs that enhance the accuracy of volatility predictions. Empirical results from a 15-year study of eight major global indices show that the Temporal GAT outperforms traditional GARCH models and other machine learning methods, particularly in short- to mid-term forecasts. The sensitivity and scenario-based analysis over a range of parameters and hyperparameters further demonstrate the significance of the proposed technique. Hence, this work highlights the potential of GNNs in modeling complex market behaviors, providing valuable insights for financial analysts and investors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Enhancing and Accelerating Few-Shot Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16845v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in node classification. However, GNNs perform poorly in the Few-Shot Node Classification (FSNC) task that requires robust generalization to make accurate predictions for unseen classes with limited labels. To tackle the challenge, we propose the integration of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)--a technique designed to enhance model generalization by finding a flat minimum of the loss landscape--into GNN training. The standard SAM approach, however, consists of two forward-backward steps in each training iteration, doubling the computational cost compared to the base optimizer (e.g., Adam). To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel algorithm, Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FGSAM), that integrates the rapid training of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with the superior performance of GNNs. Specifically, we utilize GNNs for parameter perturbation while employing MLPs to minimize the perturbed loss so that we can find a flat minimum with good generalization more efficiently. Moreover, our method reutilizes the gradient from the perturbation phase to incorporate graph topology into the minimization process at almost zero additional cost. To further enhance training efficiency, we develop FGSAM+ that executes exact perturbations periodically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the standard SAM with lower computational costs in FSNC tasks. In particular, our FGSAM+ as a SAM variant offers a faster optimization than the base optimizer in most cases. In addition to FSNC, our proposed methods also demonstrate competitive performance in the standard node classification task for heterophilic graphs, highlighting the broad applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/draym28/FGSAM_NeurIPS24.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS24; The first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16822v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual nodesattributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to integrate multiple GNNs and leverage LLM's strengths, resulting in better performance. Experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust, superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EnsemGNN-E267/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fair Graph Representation Learning in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11493v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning from network data, the fairness of GNN models has raised great attention lately. Fair GNNs aim to ensure that node representations can be accurately classified, but not easily associated with a specific group. Existing advanced approaches essentially enhance the generalisation of node representation in combination with data augmentation strategy, and do not directly impose constraints on the fairness of GNNs. In this work, we identify that a fundamental reason for the unfairness of GNNs in social network learning is the phenomenon of social homophily, i.e., users in the same group are more inclined to congregate. The message-passing mechanism of GNNs can cause users in the same group to have similar representations due to social homophily, leading model predictions to establish spurious correlations with sensitive attributes. Inspired by this reason, we propose a method called Equity-Aware GNN (EAGNN) towards fair graph representation learning. Specifically, to ensure that model predictions are independent of sensitive attributes while maintaining prediction performance, we introduce constraints for fair representation learning based on three principles: sufficiency, independence, and separation. We theoretically demonstrate that our EAGNN method can effectively achieve group fairness. Extensive experiments on three datasets with varying levels of social homophily illustrate that our EAGNN method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across two fairness metrics and offers competitive effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[GALA: Graph Diffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw for Source-free Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16606v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free domain adaptation is a crucial machine learning topic, as it contains numerous applications in the real world, particularly with respect to data privacy. Existing approaches predominantly focus on Euclidean data, such as images and videos, while the exploration of non-Euclidean graph data remains scarce. Recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches can suffer from serious performance decline due to domain shift and label scarcity in source-free adaptation scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel method named Graph Diffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw (GALA), tailored for source-free graph domain adaptation. To achieve domain alignment, GALA employs a graph diffusion model to reconstruct source-style graphs from target data. Specifically, a score-based graph diffusion model is trained using source graphs to learn the generative source styles. Then, we introduce perturbations to target graphs via a stochastic differential equation instead of sampling from a prior, followed by the reverse process to reconstruct source-style graphs. We feed the source-style graphs into an off-the-shelf GNN and introduce class-specific thresholds with curriculum learning, which can generate accurate and unbiased pseudo-labels for target graphs. Moreover, we develop a simple yet effective graph-mixing strategy named graph jigsaw to combine confident graphs and unconfident graphs, which can enhance generalization capabilities and robustness via consistency learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of GALA.</p></details> | IEEE TPAMI |

GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian's rank than random sampling while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving graph rank and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Insights into Line Graph Transformation on Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16138v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Line graph transformation has been widely studied in graph theory, where each node in a line graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph. This has inspired a series of graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to transformed line graphs, which have proven effective in various graph representation learning tasks. However, there is limited theoretical study on how line graph transformation affects the expressivity of GNN models. In this study, we focus on two types of graphs known to be challenging to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests: Cai-F\"urer-Immerman (CFI) graphs and strongly regular graphs, and show that applying line graph transformation helps exclude these challenging graph properties, thus potentially assist WL tests in distinguishing these graphs. We empirically validate our findings by conducting a series of experiments that compare the accuracy and efficiency of graph isomorphism tests and GNNs on both line-transformed and original graphs across these graph structure types.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, code available at https://github.com/lukeyf/graphs-and-lines</p></details> |

By leveraging the vast open-world knowledge within LLMs, we can more effectively interpret and utilize textual data to better characterize heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often have different labels. However, existing approaches for heterophilic graphs overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into their heterophilic contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual content of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance node classification on heterophilic graphs.</p></details> | Under review |

The AI "apps" are selected on the basis of contextual information such as network conditions, topology, traffic statistics, and design goals. The mapping between context and AI model parameters is ideally done in a zero-shot fashion via an automatic model selection (AMS) mapping that leverages only contextual information without requiring any current data. This paper introduces a general methodology for the online optimization of AMS mappings. Optimizing an AMS mapping is challenging, as it requires exposure to data collected from many different contexts. Therefore, if carried out online, this initial optimization phase would be extremely time consuming. A possible solution is to leverage a digital twin of the physical system to generate synthetic data from multiple simulated contexts. However, given that the simulator at the digital twin is imperfect, a direct use of simulated data for the optimization of the AMS mapping would yield poor performance when tested in the real system. This paper proposes a novel method for the online optimization of AMS mapping that corrects for the bias of the simulator by means of limited real data collected from the physical system. Experimental results for a graph neural network-based power control app demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for a journal publication</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Goal Tracking of Multiple Mobile Robots Based on Geometric Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07105v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple mobile robots play a significant role in various spatially distributed tasks, highlighting the importance of collaborative path planning to enhance operational efficiency. In unfamiliar and non-repetitive scenarios, reconstructing the global map can be time-inefficient and sometimes unrealistic. Therefore, research has focused on achieving real-time collaborative planning by utilizing sensor data from multiple robots located at different positions, without relying on a global map. This paper introduces a Multi-Robot Collaborative Path Planning method based on a Geometric Graph Neural Network (MRPP-GeoGNN). First, the features of each neighboring robot's sensory data are extracted, and the relative positions of neighboring robots are integrated into each interaction layer to incorporate obstacle information along with location details. Subsequently, GeoGNN maps the amalgamated local environment features to multiple forward directions for the robot's actual movement. An expert data generation method is devised for the robot to advance step by step in the physical environment, generating different expert data in ROS to train the network. We conducted both simulations and physical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrate approximately a 5% improvement in accuracy compared to the model based solely on CNN using expert datasets. In the ROS simulation test, the success rate is enhanced by about 4% compared to CNN, and the flow time increase is reduced by approximately 8%, surpassing other GNN models. The physical experimental results indicate that the proposed method enables the robot to navigate successfully in the actual environment and achieve the shortest average path length compared to the benchmark method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Temporal GCN for Smart Grid State Estimation Under Topology Inaccuracies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16008v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Estimation is a crucial task in power systems. Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated significant potential in state estimation for power systems by effectively analyzing measurement data and capturing the complex interactions and interrelations among the measurements through the system's graph structure. However, the information about the system's graph structure may be inaccurate due to noise, attack or lack of accurate information about the topology of the system. This paper studies these scenarios under topology uncertainties and evaluates the impact of the topology uncertainties on the performance of a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) for state estimation in power systems. In order to make the model resilient to topology uncertainties, modifications in the TGCN model are proposed to incorporate a knowledge graph, generated based on the measurement data. This knowledge graph supports the assumed uncertain system graph. Two variations of the TGCN architecture are introduced to integrate the knowledge graph, and their performances are evaluated and compared to demonstrate improved resilience against topology uncertainties. The evaluation results indicate that while the two proposed architecture show different performance, they both improve the performance of the TGCN state estimation under topology uncertainties.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

This paper introduces a novel approach to Deformable Object Manipulation (DOM) by emphasizing the identification and manipulation of Structures of Interest (SOIs) in deformable fabric bags. We propose a bimanual manipulation framework that leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based latent dynamics model to succinctly represent and predict the behavior of these SOIs. Our approach involves constructing a graph representation from partial point cloud data of the object and learning the latent dynamics model that effectively captures the essential deformations of the fabric bag within a reduced computational space. By integrating this latent dynamics model with Model Predictive Control (MPC), we empower robotic manipulators to perform precise and stable manipulation tasks focused on the SOIs. We have validated our framework through various empirical experiments demonstrating its efficacy in bimanual manipulation of fabric bags. Our contributions not only address the complexities inherent in DOM but also provide new perspectives and methodologies for enhancing robotic interactions with deformable objects by concentrating on their critical structural elements.

| **[Focus Where It Matters: Graph Selective State Focused Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15849v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) lack scalability and lose individual node characteristics due to over-smoothing, especially in the case of deeper networks. This results in sub-optimal feature representation, affecting the model's performance on tasks involving dynamically changing graphs. To address this issue, we present Graph Selective States Focused Attention Networks (GSANs) based neural network architecture for graph-structured data. The GSAN is enabled by multi-head masked self-attention (MHMSA) and selective state space modeling (S3M) layers to overcome the limitations of GNNs. In GSAN, the MHMSA allows GSAN to dynamically emphasize crucial node connections, particularly in evolving graph environments. The S3M layer enables the network to adjust dynamically in changing node states and improving predictions of node behavior in varying contexts without needing primary knowledge of the graph structure. Furthermore, the S3M layer enhances the generalization of unseen structures and interprets how node states influence link importance. With this, GSAN effectively outperforms inductive and transductive tasks and overcomes the issues that traditional GNNs experience. To analyze the performance behavior of GSAN, a set of state-of-the-art comparative experiments are conducted on graphs benchmark datasets, including $Cora$, $Citeseer$, $Pubmed$ network citation, and $protein-protein-interaction$ datasets, as an outcome, GSAN improved the classification accuracy by $1.56\%$, $8.94\%$, $0.37\%$, and $1.54\%$ on $F1-score$ respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15640v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are useful for representing various realworld objects. However, graph neural networks (GNNs) tend to suffer from over-smoothing, where the representations of nodes of different classes become similar as the number of layers increases, leading to performance degradation. A method that does not require protracted tuning of the number of layers is needed to effectively construct a graph attention network (GAT), a type of GNN. Therefore, we introduce a method called "DeepGAT" for predicting the class to which nodes belong in a deep GAT. It avoids over-smoothing in a GAT by ensuring that nodes in different classes are not similar at each layer. Using DeepGAT to predict class labels, a 15-layer network is constructed without the need to tune the number of layers. DeepGAT prevented over-smoothing and achieved a 15-layer GAT with similar performance to a 2-layer GAT, as indicated by the similar attention coefficients. DeepGAT enables the training of a large network to acquire similar attention coefficients to a network with few layers. It avoids the over-smoothing problem and obviates the need to tune the number of layers, thus saving time and enhancing GNN performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, uniformly expanding the scope results in subpar performance since real-world web graphs often exhibit homophily disparity between nodes. An ideal way is personalized scopes, allowing nodes to have varying scope sizes. Existing methods typically add node-adaptive weights for each hop. Although expressive, they inevitably suffer from severe overfitting. To address this issue, we formalize personalized scoping as a separate scope classification problem that overcomes GNN overfitting in node classification. Specifically, we predict the optimal GNN depth for each node. Our theoretical and empirical analysis suggests that accurately predicting the depth can significantly enhance generalization. We further propose Adaptive Scope (AS), a lightweight approach that only participates in GNN inference. AS encodes structural patterns and predicts the depth to select the best model for each node's prediction. Experimental results show that AS is highly flexible with various GNN architectures across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, most GNN-based link prediction algorithms are incompetent to predict weak ties connecting different communities. Most link prediction algorithms are designed for networks with only one type of relation between nodes but neglect the fact that many complex systems, including transportation and social networks, consisting of multi-modalities of interactions that correspond to different nature of interactions and dynamics that can be modeled as multiplex network, where different types of relation are represented in different layers. This paper proposes a Multi-Relations-aware Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) framework to learn effective node representations for multiplex networks and make more accurate link predictions, especially for weak ties. Specifically, our model utilizes an intra-layer node-level feature propagation process and an inter-layer representation merge process, which applies a simple yet effective logistic or semantic attention voting mechanism to adaptively aggregate information from different layers. Extensive experiments on four diversified multiplex networks show that MRGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art multiplex link prediction algorithms on overall prediction accuracy, and works pretty well on forecasting weak ties</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to update some comparison experiments</p></details> |

Machine Learning (ML) has recently played a key role in advancing HT research. Various novel techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown HT insertion and detection capabilities. HT insertion with ML techniques, specifically, has seen a spike in research activity due to the shortcomings of conventional HT benchmarks and the inherent human design bias that occurs when we create them. This work continues this innovation by presenting a tool called TrojanForge, capable of generating HT adversarial examples that defeat HT detectors; demonstrating the capabilities of GAN-like adversarial tools for automatic HT insertion. We introduce an RL environment where the RL insertion agent interacts with HT detectors in an insertion-detection loop where the agent collects rewards based on its success in bypassing HT detectors. Our results show that this process helps inserted HTs evade various HT detectors, achieving high attack success percentages.

However, well-trained neural networks can make prediction errors after deployment as the world changes. \textit{Model editing} involves updating the base model to correct prediction errors with less accessible training data and computational resources. Despite recent advances in model editors in computer vision and natural language processing, editable training in graph neural networks (GNNs) is rarely explored. The challenge with editable GNN training lies in the inherent information aggregation across neighbors, which can lead model editors to affect the predictions of other nodes unintentionally. In this paper, we first observe the gradient of cross-entropy loss for the target node and training nodes with significant inconsistency, which indicates that directly fine-tuning the base model using the loss on the target node deteriorates the performance on training nodes. Motivated by the gradient inconsistency observation, we propose a simple yet effective \underline{G}radient \underline{R}ewiring method for \underline{E}ditable graph neural network training, named \textbf{GRE}. Specifically, we first store the anchor gradient of the loss on training nodes to preserve the locality. Subsequently, we rewire the gradient of the loss on the target node to preserve performance on the training node using anchor gradient. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GRE on various model architectures and graph datasets in terms of multiple editing situations.

| **[Behavior-Inspired Neural Networks for Relational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14746v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From pedestrians to Kuramoto oscillators, interactions between agents govern how a multitude of dynamical systems evolve in space and time. Discovering how these agents relate to each other can improve our understanding of the often complex dynamics that underlie these systems. Recent works learn to categorize relationships between agents based on observations of their physical behavior. These approaches are limited in that the relationship categories are modelled as outcomes of categorical distribution, when in real world systems categories often intermingle and interact. In this work, we introduce a level of abstraction between the observable behavior of agents and the latent categories that determine their behavior. To do this, we learn a mapping from agent behavior to agent preferences for each latent category in a graph neural network. We integrate the physical proximity of agents and their preferences in a nonlinear opinion dynamics model which provides a mechanism to identify mutually exclusive latent categories, predict an agent's evolution in time, and control an agent's physical behavior. We demonstrate the utility of our model for learning interpretable categories, and its efficacy on long-horizon prediction across several benchmarks where we outperform existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/CS-SAIL/Tensor-MV-GCL.git.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have raised concerns about the statistical reliability of uncertainty estimates produced by GNNs. This paper addresses this crucial challenge by introducing a novel technique for quantifying uncertainty in non-exchangeable graph-structured data, while simultaneously reducing the size of label prediction sets in graph classification tasks. We propose Conformalized Tensor-based Topological Neural Networks (CF-T2NN), a new approach for rigorous prediction inference over graphs. CF-T2NN employs tensor decomposition and topological knowledge learning to navigate and interpret the inherent uncertainty in decision-making processes. This method enables a more nuanced understanding and handling of prediction uncertainties, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of neural network outcomes. Our empirical validation, conducted across 10 real-world datasets, demonstrates the superiority of CF-T2NN over a wide array of state-of-the-art methods on various graph benchmarks. This work not only enhances the GNN framework with robust uncertainty quantification capabilities but also sets a new standard for reliability and precision in graph-structured data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.12007</p></details> |

To address this need, we introduce Conditional Prediction ROC (CP-ROC) bands, offering uncertainty quantification for ROC curves and robustness to distributional shifts in test data. Although developed for Tensorized Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs), CP-ROC is adaptable to general Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and other machine learning models. We establish statistically guaranteed coverage for CP-ROC under a local exchangeability condition. This addresses uncertainty challenges for ROC curves under non-iid setting, ensuring reliability when test graph distributions differ from training data. Empirically, to establish local exchangeability for TGNNs, we introduce a data-driven approach to construct local calibration sets for graphs. Comprehensive evaluations show that CP-ROC significantly improves prediction reliability across diverse tasks. This method enhances uncertainty quantification efficiency and reliability for ROC curves, proving valuable for real-world applications with non-iid objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18772v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks, with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to improve supply chain visibility and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for this setting by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data and data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models successfully infer production functions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 6%-50% (across datasets), and forecast future transactions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11%-62%</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Graph Neural Networks with Large Language Models: A Counterfactual Perspective for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15165v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become successful in molecular property prediction tasks such as toxicity analysis. However, due to the black-box nature of GNNs, their outputs can be concerning in high-stakes decision-making scenarios, e.g., drug discovery. Facing such an issue, Graph Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) has emerged as a promising approach to improve GNN transparency. However, current GCE methods usually fail to take domain-specific knowledge into consideration, which can result in outputs that are not easily comprehensible by humans. To address this challenge, we propose a novel GCE method, LLM-GCE, to unleash the power of large language models (LLMs) in explaining GNNs for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we utilize an autoencoder to generate the counterfactual graph topology from a set of counterfactual text pairs (CTPs) based on an input graph. Meanwhile, we also incorporate a CTP dynamic feedback module to mitigate LLM hallucination, which provides intermediate feedback derived from the generated counterfactuals as an attempt to give more faithful guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LLM-GCE. Our code is released on https://github.com/YinhanHe123/new\_LLM4GNNExplanation.</p></details> |  |

While the field has seen tremendous advancement in the last few years, new applications and implementation scenarios present novel challenges and opportunities. These range from leveraging the conversational context, speaker, and emotion dynamics modelling, to interpreting common sense expressions, informal language, and sarcasm, addressing challenges of real-time ERC, recognizing emotion causes, different taxonomies across datasets, multilingual ERC, and interpretability. This survey starts by introducing ERC, elaborating on the challenges and opportunities of this task. It proceeds with a description of the emotion taxonomies and a variety of ERC benchmark datasets employing such taxonomies. This is followed by descriptions comparing the most prominent works in ERC with explanations of the neural architectures employed. Then, it provides advisable ERC practices towards better frameworks, elaborating on methods to deal with subjectivity in annotations and modelling and methods to deal with the typically unbalanced ERC datasets. Finally, it presents systematic review tables comparing several works regarding the methods used and their performance. Benchmarking these works highlights resorting to pre-trained Transformer Language Models to extract utterance representations, using Gated and Graph Neural Networks to model the interactions between these utterances, and leveraging Generative Large Language Models to tackle ERC within a generative framework. This survey emphasizes the advantage of leveraging techniques to address unbalanced data, the exploration of mixed emotions, and the benefits of incorporating annotation subjectivity in the learning phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Self-Supervised Pretraining on 3D Protein Structures using Subgraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14142v3)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning aims to learn informative protein embeddings capable of addressing crucial biological questions, such as protein function prediction. Although sequence-based transformer models have shown promising results by leveraging the vast amount of protein sequence data in a self-supervised way, there is still a gap in exploiting the available 3D protein structures. In this work, we propose a pre-training scheme going beyond trivial masking methods leveraging 3D and hierarchical structures of proteins. We propose a novel self-supervised method to pretrain 3D graph neural networks on 3D protein structures, by predicting the distances between local geometric centroids of protein subgraphs and the global geometric centroid of the protein. By considering subgraphs and their relationships to the global protein structure, our model can better learn the geometric properties of the protein structure. We experimentally show that our proposed pertaining strategy leads to significant improvements up to 6\%, in the performance of 3D GNNs in various protein classification tasks. Our work opens new possibilities in unsupervised learning for protein graph models while eliminating the need for multiple views, augmentations, or masking strategies which are currently used so far.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Equilibrium Algorithmic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15059v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) research has demonstrated that graph neural networks (GNNs) could learn to execute classical algorithms. However, most previous approaches have always used a recurrent architecture, where each iteration of the GNN matches an iteration of the algorithm. In this paper we study neurally solving algorithms from a different perspective: since the algorithm's solution is often an equilibrium, it is possible to find the solution directly by solving an equilibrium equation. Our approach requires no information on the ground-truth number of steps of the algorithm, both during train and test time. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the performance of GNNs on executing algorithms and is a step towards speeding up existing NAR models. Our empirical evidence, leveraging algorithms from the CLRS-30 benchmark, validates that one can train a network to solve algorithmic problems by directly finding the equilibrium. We discuss the practical implementation of such models and propose regularisations to improve the performance of these equilibrium reasoners.</p></details> |  |

Unexpected increases in passengers can cause overcrowded vehicles, longer boarding times, and service disruptions. Traditional time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA face limitations, particularly in short-term predictions and integration of spatial and temporal features. These models struggle with the dynamic nature of ridership patterns and often ignore spatial correlations between nearby stops. Deep Learning (DL) models present a promising alternative, demonstrating superior performance in short-term prediction tasks by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal features. However, challenges such as dynamic spatial feature extraction, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency, and ensuring scalability remain. This paper introduces DST-TransitNet, a hybrid DL model for system-wide station-level ridership prediction. This proposed model uses graph neural networks (GNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to dynamically integrate the changing temporal and spatial correlations within the stations. The model also employs a precise time series decomposition framework to enhance accuracy and interpretability. Tested on Bogota's BRT system data, with three distinct social scenarios, DST-TransitNet outperformed state-of-the-art models in precision, efficiency and robustness. Meanwhile, it maintains stability over long prediction intervals, demonstrating practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 22 figures.

However, their scalability remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with large-scale graphs. To tackle this challenge, coarsening-based methods are used to reduce the graph into a smaller one, resulting in faster computation. However, no previous research has tackled the computation cost during the inference. This motivated us to ponder whether we can trade off the improvement in training time of coarsening-based approaches with inference time. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs through subgraph-based techniques. We reduce the computational burden during the training and inference phases by using the coarsening algorithm to partition large graphs into smaller, manageable subgraphs. Previously, graph-level tasks had not been explored using this approach. We propose a novel approach for using the coarsening algorithm for graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph regression. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results demonstrate that our subgraph-based GNN method achieves competitive results in node classification, node regression, graph classification, and graph regression tasks compared to traditional GNN models. Furthermore, our approach significantly reduces the inference time, enabling the practical application of GNNs to large-scale graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Distance Matrix Enough for Geometric Deep Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05743v6)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often used for tasks involving the 3D geometry of a given graph, such as molecular dynamics simulation. While incorporating Euclidean distance into Message Passing Neural Networks (referred to as Vanilla DisGNN) is a straightforward way to learn the geometry, it has been demonstrated that Vanilla DisGNN is geometrically incomplete. In this work, we first construct families of novel and symmetric geometric graphs that Vanilla DisGNN cannot distinguish even when considering all-pair distances, which greatly expands the existing counterexample families. Our counterexamples show the inherent limitation of Vanilla DisGNN to capture symmetric geometric structures. We then propose $k$-DisGNNs, which can effectively exploit the rich geometry contained in the distance matrix. We demonstrate the high expressive power of $k$-DisGNNs from three perspectives: 1. They can learn high-order geometric information that cannot be captured by Vanilla DisGNN. 2. They can unify some existing well-designed geometric models. 3. They are universal function approximators from geometric graphs to scalars (when $k\geq 2$) and vectors (when $k\geq 3$). Most importantly, we establish a connection between geometric deep learning (GDL) and traditional graph representation learning (GRL), showing that those highly expressive GNN models originally designed for GRL can also be applied to GDL with impressive performance, and that existing complicated, equivariant models are not the only solution. Experiments verify our theory. Our $k$-DisGNNs achieve many new state-of-the-art results on MD17.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023.

We then propose a method for implementing MFCNs on high-dimensional point clouds that relies on approximating the manifold by a sparse graph. We prove that our method is consistent in the sense that it converges to a continuum limit as the number of data points tends to infinity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS Workshop on Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations (Extended Abstract Track)</p></details> |

However, existing GCL-based text classification methods often suffer from negative sampling bias, where similar nodes are incorrectly paired as negative pairs. This can lead to over-clustering, where instances of the same class are divided into different clusters. To address the over-clustering issue, we propose an innovative GCL-based method of graph contrastive learning via cluster-refined negative sampling for semi-supervised text classification, namely ClusterText. Firstly, we combine the pre-trained model Bert with graph neural networks to learn text representations. Secondly, we introduce a clustering refinement strategy, which clusters the learned text representations to obtain pseudo labels. For each text node, its negative sample set is drawn from different clusters. Additionally, we propose a self-correction mechanism to mitigate the loss of true negative samples caused by clustering inconsistency. By calculating the Euclidean distance between each text node and other nodes within the same cluster, distant nodes are still selected as negative samples. Our proposed ClusterText demonstrates good scalable computing, as it can effectively extract important information from from a large amount of data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ClusterText in text classification tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Are High-Degree Representations Really Unnecessary in Equivariant Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11443v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large number of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for unseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a perspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction tasks. This enables building a versatile and specialized LLM that can be adapted to novel MPP tasks without any fine-tuning through zero- and few-shot in-context learning (ICL). MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context reasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new benchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks. More importantly, with just two-shot examples, MolecularGPT can outperform standard supervised graph neural network methods on 4 out of 7 datasets. It also excels state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 15.7% increase on classification accuracy and decrease of 17.9 on regression metrics (e.g., RMSE) under zero-shot. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as effective few-shot molecular property predictors. The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/MolecularGPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Enhanced Retrieval for Question Answering of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06572v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation has revolutionized large language model (LLM) outputs by providing factual supports. Nevertheless, it struggles to capture all the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval methods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in isolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages that are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize such relatedness for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by exploiting the relatedness between passages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by connecting passages that are structure-related or keyword-related. A graph neural network (GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between passages and improve the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we extend our method to handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates the graphs of passages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of supporting passages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-Ret achieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single query of LLMs than strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret further improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.4% accuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.</p></details> | Under review |

However, naively plugging PH features into GNN layers always results in marginal improvement with low interpretability. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism for injecting global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, motivated by the observation that filtration operation in PH naturally aligns graph pooling in a cut-off manner. In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance. Experimentally, we apply our mechanism to a collection of graph pooling methods and observe consistent and substantial performance gain over several popular datasets, demonstrating its wide applicability and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Current solutions often train hybrid models on auxiliary data for both cold and warm users/items, potentially degrading the experience for the latter. This drawback limits their viability in practical scenarios where the satisfaction of existing warm users/items is paramount. Although graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at warm recommendations by effective collaborative signal modeling, they haven't been effectively leveraged for the cold-start issue within a user-item graph, which is largely due to the lack of initial connections for cold user/item entities. Addressing this requires a GNN adept at cold-start recommendations without sacrificing performance for existing ones. To this end, we introduce Graph Neural Patching for Cold-Start Recommendations (GNP), a customized GNN framework with dual functionalities: GWarmer for modeling collaborative signal on existing warm users/items and Patching Networks for simulating and enhancing GWarmer's performance on cold-start recommendations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets confirm GNP's superiority in recommending both warm and cold users/items.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by Australasian Database Conference 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2209.12215</p></details> |

By employing vector quantization, we compress continuous node embeddings from multiple layers of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) into discrete codes, applicable under both self-supervised and supervised learning paradigms. These node IDs capture high-level abstractions of graph data and offer interpretability that traditional GNN embeddings lack. Extensive experiments on 34 datasets, encompassing node classification, graph classification, link prediction, and attributed graph clustering tasks, demonstrate that the generated node IDs significantly enhance speed and memory efficiency while achieving competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Networks Under Fire](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06417v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictions made by graph neural networks (GNNs) usually lack interpretability due to their complex computational behavior and the abstract nature of graphs. In an attempt to tackle this, many GNN explanation methods have emerged. Their goal is to explain a model's predictions and thereby obtain trust when GNN models are deployed in decision critical applications. Most GNN explanation methods work in a post-hoc manner and provide explanations in the form of a small subset of important edges and/or nodes. In this paper we demonstrate that these explanations can unfortunately not be trusted, as common GNN explanation methods turn out to be highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations. That is, even small perturbations of the original graph structure that preserve the model's predictions may yield drastically different explanations. This calls into question the trustworthiness and practical utility of post-hoc explanation methods for GNNs. To be able to attack GNN explanation models, we devise a novel attack method dubbed \textit{GXAttack}, the first \textit{optimization-based} adversarial white-box attack method for post-hoc GNN explanations under such settings. Due to the devastating effectiveness of our attack, we call for an adversarial evaluation of future GNN explainers to demonstrate their robustness.

Real-world graph data often exhibits a long-tail distribution with sparse labels, emphasizing the importance of GNNs' ability in few-shot node classification, which entails categorizing nodes with limited data. Traditional episodic meta-learning approaches have shown promise in this domain, but they face an inherent limitation: it might lead the model to converge to suboptimal solutions because of random and uniform task assignment, ignoring task difficulty levels. This could lead the meta-learner to face complex tasks too soon, hindering proper learning. Ideally, the meta-learner should start with simple concepts and advance to more complex ones, like human learning. So, we introduce CPT, a novel two-stage curriculum learning method that aligns task difficulty with the meta-learner's progressive competence, enhancing overall performance. Specifically, in CPT's initial stage, the focus is on simpler tasks, fostering foundational skills for engaging with complex tasks later. Importantly, the second stage dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on the meta-learner's growing competence, aiming for optimal knowledge acquisition. Extensive experiments on popular node classification datasets demonstrate significant improvements of our strategy over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2206.11972 by other authors</p></details> |

However, the explanation of the predicted facts has not caught the necessary attention. Proper explanations for the results of GNN-based KGC models increase model transparency and help researchers develop more reliable models. Existing practices for explaining KGC tasks rely on instance/subgraph-based approaches, while in some scenarios, paths can provide more user-friendly and interpretable explanations. Nonetheless, the methods for generating path-based explanations for KGs have not been well-explored. To address this gap, we propose Power-Link, the first path-based KGC explainer that explores GNN-based models. We design a novel simplified graph-powering technique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fully parallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme. We further introduce three new metrics for quantitative evaluation of the explanations, together with a qualitative human evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-Link outperforms the SOTA baselines in interpretability, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks by Learning Continuous Edge Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14109v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) traditionally employ a message-passing mechanism that resembles diffusion over undirected graphs, which often leads to homogenization of node features and reduced discriminative power in tasks such as node classification. Our key insight for addressing this limitation is to assign fuzzy edge directions -- that can vary continuously from node $i$ pointing to node $j$ to vice versa -- to the edges of a graph so that features can preferentially flow in one direction between nodes to enable long-range information transmission across the graph. We also introduce a novel complex-valued Laplacian for directed graphs with fuzzy edges where the real and imaginary parts represent information flow in opposite directions. Using this Laplacian, we propose a general framework, called Continuous Edge Direction (CoED) GNN, for learning on graphs with fuzzy edges and prove its expressivity limits using a generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test for directed graphs with fuzzy edges. Our architecture aggregates neighbor features scaled by the learned edge directions and processes the aggregated messages from in-neighbors and out-neighbors separately alongside the self-features of the nodes. Since continuous edge directions are differentiable, they can be learned jointly with the GNN weights via gradient-based optimization. CoED GNN is particularly well-suited for graph ensemble data where the graph structure remains fixed but multiple realizations of node features are available, such as in gene regulatory networks, web connectivity graphs, and power grids. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets that learning continuous edge directions significantly improves performance both for undirected and directed graphs compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMGNN: Detecting and Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14105v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that GNNs are highly susceptible to multiple adversarial attacks. Among these, graph backdoor attacks pose one of the most prominent threats, where attackers cause models to misclassify by learning the backdoored features with injected triggers and modified target labels during the training phase. Based on the features of the triggers, these attacks can be categorized into out-of-distribution (OOD) and in-distribution (ID) graph backdoor attacks, triggers with notable differences from the clean sample feature distributions constitute OOD backdoor attacks, whereas the triggers in ID backdoor attacks are nearly identical to the clean sample feature distributions. Existing methods can successfully defend against OOD backdoor attacks by comparing the feature distribution of triggers and clean samples but fail to mitigate stealthy ID backdoor attacks. Due to the lack of proper supervision signals, the main task accuracy is negatively affected in defending against ID backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose DMGNN against OOD and ID graph backdoor attacks that can powerfully eliminate stealthiness to guarantee defense effectiveness and improve the model performance. Specifically, DMGNN can easily identify the hidden ID and OOD triggers via predicting label transitions based on counterfactual explanation. To further filter the diversity of generated explainable graphs and erase the influence of the trigger features, we present a reverse sampling pruning method to screen and discard the triggers directly on the data level. Extensive experimental evaluations on open graph datasets demonstrate that DMGNN far outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense methods, reducing the attack success rate to 5% with almost negligible degradation in model performance (within 3.5%).</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Federated Graph Neural Networks with Missing Neighbor Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14010v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs play a crucial role in data mining and machine learning, representing real-world objects and interactions. As graph datasets grow, managing large, decentralized subgraphs becomes essential, particularly within federated learning frameworks. These frameworks face significant challenges, including missing neighbor information, which can compromise model reliability in safety-critical settings. Deployment of federated learning models trained in such settings necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of the models. This study extends the applicability of Conformal Prediction (CP), a well-established method for uncertainty quantification, to federated graph learning. We specifically tackle the missing links issue in distributed subgraphs to minimize its adverse effects on CP set sizes. We discuss data dependencies across the distributed subgraphs and establish conditions for CP validity and precise test-time coverage. We introduce a Variational Autoencoder-based approach for reconstructing missing neighbors to mitigate the negative impact of missing data. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding smaller prediction sets while ensuring coverage guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Graph Quantized Tokenizers for Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13798v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers serve as the backbone architectures of Foundational Models, where a domain-specific tokenizer helps them adapt to various domains. Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as a leading model in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities, with existing approaches relying on heuristics or GNNs co-trained with Transformers. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 out of 18 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Our multi-agent system features three key components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and planning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that dynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI agents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of MPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic potential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw dislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these atomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force calculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for physics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by reducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct all-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the dynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates vast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material properties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by several computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of advanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex systems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDeR: Safeguarding Efficiency, Balancing, and Robustness via Prototypical Graph Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13761v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training high-quality deep models necessitates vast amounts of data, resulting in overwhelming computational and memory demands. Recently, data pruning, distillation, and coreset selection have been developed to streamline data volume by retaining, synthesizing, or selecting a small yet informative subset from the full set. Among these methods, data pruning incurs the least additional training cost and offers the most practical acceleration benefits. However, it is the most vulnerable, often suffering significant performance degradation with imbalanced or biased data schema, thus raising concerns about its accuracy and reliability in on-device deployment. Therefore, there is a looming need for a new data pruning paradigm that maintains the efficiency of previous practices while ensuring balance and robustness. Unlike the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, where mature solutions have been developed to address these issues, graph neural networks (GNNs) continue to struggle with increasingly large-scale, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, lacking a unified dataset pruning solution. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dynamic soft-pruning method, GDeR, designed to update the training ``basket'' during the process using trainable prototypes. GDeR first constructs a well-modeled graph embedding hypersphere and then samples \textit{representative, balanced, and unbiased subsets} from this embedding space, which achieves the goal we called Graph Training Debugging. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three GNN backbones, demonstrate that GDeR (I) achieves or surpasses the performance of the full dataset with 30%~50% fewer training samples, (II) attains up to a 2.81x lossless training speedup, and (III) outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in imbalanced training and noisy training scenarios by 0.3%~4.3% and 3.6%~7.8%, respectively.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[CERES: Critical-Event Reconstruction via Temporal Scene Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13514v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a method for on-demand scenario generation in simulation, grounded on real-world data. Evaluating the behaviour of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in both safety-critical and regular scenarios is essential for assessing their robustness before real-world deployment. By integrating scenarios derived from real-world datasets into the simulation, we enhance the plausibility and validity of testing sets. This work introduces a novel approach that employs temporal scene graphs to capture evolving spatiotemporal relationships among scene entities from a real-world dataset, enabling the generation of dynamic scenarios in simulation through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). User-defined action and criticality conditioning are used to ensure flexible, tailored scenario creation. Our model significantly outperforms the benchmarks in accurately predicting links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We further evaluate the validity and compatibility of our generated scenarios in an off-the-shelf simulator.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Interpreting Temporal Graph Neural Networks with Koopman Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13469v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have shown promising results in many domains, from forecasting to epidemiology. However, understanding the dynamics learned by these models and explaining their behaviour is significantly more complex than for models dealing with static data. Inspired by Koopman theory, which allows a simpler description of intricate, nonlinear dynamical systems, we introduce an explainability approach for temporal graphs. We present two methods to interpret the STGNN's decision process and identify the most relevant spatial and temporal patterns in the input for the task at hand. The first relies on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a Koopman-inspired dimensionality reduction method. The second relies on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a popular method for discovering governing equations, which we use for the first time as a general tool for explainability. We show how our methods can correctly identify interpretable features such as infection times and infected nodes in the context of dissemination processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Invariant Principle for Heterophilic Graph Structure Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09490v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results for semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs. Notably, most real-world heterophilic graphs are composed of a mixture of nodes with different neighbor patterns, exhibiting local node-level homophilic and heterophilic structures. However, existing works are only devoted to designing better HGNN backbones or architectures for node classification tasks on heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks simultaneously, and their analyses of HGNN performance with respect to nodes are only based on the determined data distribution without exploring the effect caused by this structural difference between training and testing nodes. How to learn invariant node representations on heterophilic graphs to handle this structure difference or distribution shifts remains unexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of previous graph-based invariant learning methods from the perspective of data augmentation. Then, we propose \textbf{HEI}, a framework capable of generating invariant node representations through incorporating heterophily information to infer latent environments without augmentation, which are then used for invariant prediction, under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. We theoretically show that our proposed method can achieve guaranteed performance under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and backbones can also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Addressing Heterogeneity and Heterophily in Graphs: A Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13373v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant scholarly attention for their powerful capabilities in modeling graph structures. Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Existing studies often address heterogeneous and heterophilic graphs separately, leaving a research gap in the understanding of heterogeneous heterophilic graphs-those that feature diverse node or relation types with dissimilar connected nodes. To address this gap, we investigate the application of spectral graph filters within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs a dual-module approach: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. The local independent filtering module applies polynomial filters to each subgraph independently to adapt to different homophily, while the global hybrid filtering module captures interactions across different subgraphs. Extensive empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of H2SGNN compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmoothGNN: Smoothing-aware GNN for Unsupervised Node Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17525v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The smoothing issue in graph learning leads to indistinguishable node representations, posing significant challenges for graph-related tasks. However, our experiments reveal that this problem can uncover underlying properties of node anomaly detection (NAD) that previous research has missed. We introduce Individual Smoothing Patterns (ISP) and Neighborhood Smoothing Patterns (NSP), which indicate that the representations of anomalous nodes are harder to smooth than those of normal ones. In addition, we explore the theoretical implications of these patterns, demonstrating the potential benefits of ISP and NSP for NAD tasks. Motivated by these findings, we propose SmoothGNN, a novel unsupervised NAD framework. First, we design a learning component to explicitly capture ISP for detecting node anomalies. Second, we design a spectral graph neural network to implicitly learn ISP to enhance detection. Third, we design an effective coefficient based on our findings that NSP can serve as coefficients for node representations, aiding in the identification of anomalous nodes. Furthermore, we devise a novel anomaly measure to calculate loss functions and anomalous scores for nodes, reflecting the properties of NAD using ISP and NSP. Extensive experiments on 9 real datasets show that SmoothGNN outperforms the best rival by an average of 14.66% in AUC and 7.28% in Average Precision, with 75x running time speedup, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeSubNet: Gene Interaction Inference for Disease Subtype Network Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13178v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving gene functional networks from knowledge databases presents a challenge due to the mismatch between disease networks and subtype-specific variations. Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods, often fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases or explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we propose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting gene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes. Graphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific networks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three modules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from patient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures representations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring accurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two representations using an inference loss that leverages graph generation capabilities, conditioned on the patient separation loss, to refine subtype-specific information in the learned representation. GeSubNet consistently outperforms traditional methods, with average improvements of 30.6%, 21.0%, 20.1%, and 56.6% across four graph evaluation metrics, averaged over four cancer datasets. Particularly, we conduct a biological simulation experiment to assess how the behavior of selected genes from over 11,000 candidates affects subtypes or patient distributions. The results show that the generated network has the potential to identify subtype-specific genes with an 83% likelihood of impacting patient distribution shifts.

HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 Graphic Compute Dies (GCDs) on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Each HPO trial was ranked based on both accuracy and energy consumption. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures (selected with judicious balance between accuracy and energy consumption) continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contributions establish core capabilities for rapidly developing, training, and deploying further GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</p></details> | 20 pages, 25 figures |

However, deploying these approaches for large-scale networks poses significant challenges. In this paper, we leverage the power of heterogeneous graph neural networks to propose a novel end-to-end surrogate model for traffic assignment, specifically user equilibrium traffic assignment problems. Our model integrates an adaptive graph attention mechanism with auxiliary "virtual" links connecting origin-destination node pairs, This integration enables the model to capture spatial traffic patterns across different links, By incorporating the node-based flow conservation law into the overall loss function, the model ensures the prediction results in compliance with flow conservation principles, resulting in highly accurate predictions for both link flow and flow-capacity ratios. We present numerical experiments on urban transportation networks and show that the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model outperforms other conventional neural network models in terms of convergence rate and prediction accuracy. Notably, by introducing two different training strategies, the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model can also be generalized to different network topologies. This approach offers a promising solution for complex traffic flow analysis and prediction, enhancing our understanding and management of a wide range of transportation systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
