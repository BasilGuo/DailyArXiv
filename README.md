| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Time Series and Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18886v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of time series data is crucial for understanding trends and anomalies over time, enabling predictive insights across various sectors. Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17992v3)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) methods for structural metamodeling due to the substantial computational cost of traditional simulations. Purely data-driven strategies often face limitations in model robustness, interpretability, and dependency on extensive data. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method that integrates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks to model seismic responses of nonlinear structures. The approach constrains the ML model's solution space within known physical bounds through three main features: dimensionality reduction via combined model order reduction and wavelet analysis, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Newton's second law. Dimensionality reduction addresses structural systems' redundancy and boosts efficiency while extracting essential features through wavelet analysis. LSTM networks capture temporal dependencies for accurate time-series predictions. Manipulating the equation of motion helps learn system nonlinearities and confines solutions within physically interpretable results. These attributes allow for model training with sparse data, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Furthermore, a dataset of archetype steel moment resistant frames under seismic loading, available in the DesignSafe-CI Database [1], is considered for evaluation. The resulting metamodel handles complex data better than existing physics-guided LSTM models and outperforms other non-physics data-driven networks.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Two-way Homogeneity Pursuit for Quantile Network Vector Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18732v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model has received extensive attention for modelling complex time series, quantile VAR analysis remains relatively underexplored for high-dimensional time series data. To address this disparity, we introduce a two-way grouped network quantile (TGNQ) autoregression model for time series collected on large-scale networks, known for their significant heterogeneous and directional interactions among nodes. Our proposed model simultaneously conducts node clustering and model estimation to balance complexity and interpretability. To account for the directional influence among network nodes, each network node is assigned two latent group memberships that can be consistently estimated using our proposed estimation procedure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the consistency of membership and parameter estimators even with an overspecified number of groups. With the correct group specification, estimated parameters are proven to be asymptotically normal, enabling valid statistical inferences. Moreover, we propose a quantile information criterion for consistently selecting the number of groups. Simulation studies show promising finite sample performance, and we apply the methodology to analyze connectedness and risk spillover effects among Chinese A-share stocks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CVTN: Cross Variable and Temporal Integration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18730v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series forecasting, the Transformer architecture encounters two significant challenges: effectively mining features from historical sequences and avoiding overfitting during the learning of temporal dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper deconstructs time series forecasting into the learning of historical sequences and prediction sequences, introducing the Cross-Variable and Time Network (CVTN). This unique method divides multivariate time series forecasting into two phases: cross-variable learning for effectively mining fea tures from historical sequences, and cross-time learning to capture the temporal dependencies of prediction sequences. Separating these two phases helps avoid the impact of overfitting in cross-time learning on cross-variable learning. Exten sive experiments on various real-world datasets have confirmed its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. CVTN emphasizes three key dimensions in time series fore casting: the short-term and long-term nature of time series (locality and longevity), feature mining from both historical and prediction sequences, and the integration of cross-variable and cross-time learning. This approach not only advances the current state of time series forecasting but also provides a more comprehensive framework for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Taiwanese traffic patterns on consecutive holidays through forecast reconciliation and prediction-based anomaly detection techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09537v3)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores traffic patterns on Taiwanese highways during consecutive holidays and focuses on understanding Taiwanese highway traffic behavior. We propose a prediction-based detection method for finding highway traffic anomalies using reconciled ordinary least squares (OLS) forecasts and bootstrap prediction intervals. Two fundamental features of traffic flow time series -- namely, seasonality and spatial autocorrelation -- are captured by adding Fourier terms in OLS models, spatial aggregation (as a hierarchical structure mimicking the geographical division in regions, cities, and stations), and a reconciliation step. Our approach, although simple, is able to model complex traffic datasets with reasonable accuracy. Being based on OLS, it is efficient and permits avoiding the computational burden of more complex methods. Analyses of Taiwan's consecutive holidays in 2019, 2020, and 2021 (73 days) showed strong variations in anomalies across different directions and highways. Specifically, we detected some areas and highways comprising a high number of traffic anomalies (north direction-central and southern regions-highways No. 1 and 3, south direction-southern region-highway No.3), and others with generally normal traffic (east and west direction). These results could provide important decision-support information to traffic authorities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Scaling Effect of Deep Learning in Financial Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02072v4)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many years, researchers have been exploring the use of deep learning in the forecasting of financial time series. However, they have continued to rely on the conventional econometric approach for model optimization, optimizing the deep learning models on individual assets. In this paper, we use the stock volatility forecast as an example to illustrate global training - optimizes the deep learning model across a wide range of stocks - is both necessary and beneficial for any academic or industry practitioners who is interested in employing deep learning to forecast financial time series. Furthermore, a pre-trained foundation model for volatility forecast is introduced, capable of making accurate zero-shot forecasts for any stocks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the effectiveness of predicting covariates in LSTM Networks for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18553v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Networks are widely employed in time-series forecasting tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in univariate and certain multivariate scenarios. However, their inherent structure does not readily accommodate the integration of future, time-dependent covariates. A proposed solution, outlined by Salinas et al 2019, suggests forecasting both covariates and the target variable in a multivariate framework. In this study, we conducted comprehensive tests on publicly available time-series datasets, artificially introducing highly correlated covariates to future time-step values. Our evaluation aimed to assess the performance of an LSTM network when considering these covariates and compare it against a univariate baseline. As part of this study we introduce a novel approach using seasonal time segments in combination with an RNN architecture, which is both simple and extremely effective over long forecast horizons with comparable performance to many state of the art architectures. Our findings from the results of more than 120 models reveal that under certain conditions jointly training covariates with target variables can improve overall performance of the model, but often there exists a significant performance disparity between multivariate and univariate predictions. Surprisingly, even when provided with covariates informing the network about future target values, multivariate predictions exhibited inferior performance. In essence, compelling the network to predict multiple values can prove detrimental to model performance, even in the presence of informative covariates. These results suggest that LSTM architectures may not be suitable for forecasting tasks where predicting covariates would typically be expected to enhance model accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 con...</summary><p>9 content pages (22 total pages), 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Time Machine GPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18543v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on extensive, temporally indiscriminate text corpora, reflecting the lack of datasets with temporal metadata. This approach is not aligned with the evolving nature of language. Conventional methods for creating temporally adapted language models often depend on further pre-training static models on time-specific data. This paper presents a new approach: a series of point-in-time LLMs called Time Machine GPT (TiMaGPT), specifically designed to be nonprognosticative. This ensures they remain uninformed about future factual information and linguistic changes. This strategy is beneficial for understanding language evolution and is of critical importance when applying models in dynamic contexts, such as time-series forecasting, where foresight of future information can prove problematic. We provide access to both the models and training datasets.</p></details> | NAACL Findings 2024 |

| **[Three-Dimension Collision-Free Trajectory Planning of UAVs Based on ADS-B Information in Low-Altitude Urban Airspace](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18436v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The environment of low-altitude urban airspace is complex and variable due to numerous obstacles, non-cooperative aircrafts, and birds. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Adaptive Informative Path Planning with Multimodal Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18374v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of an autonomous agent equipped with multiple sensors, each with different sensing precision and energy costs. The agent's goal is to explore the environment and gather information subject to its resource constraints in unknown, partially observable environments. The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50%. This approach was developed in support of rover path planning for the NASA VIPER Mission.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies</p></details> |
| **[Compressed Deepfake Video Detection Based on 3D Spatiotemporal Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18149v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misuse of deepfake technology by malicious actors poses a potential threat to nations, societies, and individuals. However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMEND: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Long-tailed Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08698v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrians' future motions is critical for intelligent driving systems. Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cognitive-Driven Trajectory Prediction Model for Autonomous Driving in Mixed Autonomy Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17520v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving technology progresses, the need for precise trajectory prediction models becomes paramount. This paper introduces an innovative model that infuses cognitive insights into trajectory prediction, focusing on perceived safety and dynamic decision-making. Distinct from traditional approaches, our model excels in analyzing interactions and behavior patterns in mixed autonomy traffic scenarios. It represents a significant leap forward, achieving marked performance improvements on several key datasets. Specifically, it surpasses existing benchmarks with gains of 16.2% on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), 27.4% on the Highway Drone (HighD), and 19.8% on the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset. Our proposed model shows exceptional proficiency in handling corner cases, essential for real-world applications. Moreover, its robustness is evident in scenarios with missing or limited data, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art baselines. This adaptability and resilience position our model as a viable tool for real-world autonomous driving systems, heralding a new standard in vehicle trajectory prediction for enhanced safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Clustering of Motion Trajectories by a Distance Measure Based on Semantic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17269v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering of motion trajectories is highly relevant for human-robot interactions as it allows the anticipation of human motions, fast reaction to those, as well as the recognition of explicit gestures. Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset. The proposed method demonstrates slight advantages in clustering and strong advantages in runtime, especially for long trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2023 IEEE-RAS 22nd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids).

| **[Neural Interaction Energy for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16579v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining temporal stability is crucial in multi-agent trajectory prediction. Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[GADformer: A Transparent Transformer Model for Group Anomaly Detection on Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09841v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Anomaly Detection (GAD) identifies unusual pattern in groups where individual members might not be anomalous. This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |
| **[PTT: Point-Trajectory Transformer for Efficient Temporal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08371v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent temporal LiDAR-based 3D object detectors achieve promising performance based on the two-stage proposal-based approach. They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods. Code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/kuanchihhuang/PTT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024.

| **[Decentralized Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning in Dynamic Environments with Spatiotemporal Occupancy Grid Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15602v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a decentralized trajectory planning framework for the collision avoidance problem of multiple micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in environments with static and dynamic obstacles. The framework utilizes spatiotemporal occupancy grid maps (SOGM), which forecast the occupancy status of neighboring space in the near future, as the environment representation. Based on this representation, we extend the kinodynamic A* and the corridor-constrained trajectory optimization algorithms to efficiently tackle static and dynamic obstacles with arbitrary shapes. Collision avoidance between communicating robots is integrated by sharing planned trajectories and projecting them onto the SOGM. The simulation results show that our method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods in dynamic environments with different numbers and shapes of obstacles. Finally, the proposed method is validated in real experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, accepted to the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2024)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v4)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories. This study underscores the potential of VT-Former and its architecture, opening new avenues for future research and exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completely updated based on the reviews received for the paper</p></details> |

However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatiotemporal Hand-Eye Calibration for Trajectory Alignment in Visual(-Inertial) Odometry Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14894v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common prerequisite for evaluating a visual(-inertial) odometry (VO/VIO) algorithm is to align the timestamps and the reference frame of its estimated trajectory with a reference ground-truth derived from a system of superior precision, such as a motion capture system. The trajectory-based alignment, typically modeled as a classic hand-eye calibration, significantly influences the accuracy of evaluation metrics. However, traditional calibration methods are susceptible to the quality of the input poses. Few studies have taken this into account when evaluating VO/VIO trajectories that usually suffer from noise and drift. To fill this gap, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hand-eye calibration algorithm that fully leverages multiple constraints from screw theory for enhanced accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that our algorithm has better performance and is less noise-prone than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v3)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped locations. Numerous methods exist that target different tasks involving trajectories such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. However, most methods target only one specific task and cannot be applied universally. Existing efforts to create a universal trajectory model often involve adding prediction modules for adapting to different tasks, while also struggle with incomplete or sparse trajectories. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM) designed to support different tasks based on incomplete or sparse trajectories without the need for retraining or extra prediction modules. To addresses task adaptability on incomplete trajectories, UVTM divide the spatio-temporal features of trajectories into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to suit the input and output needs of specific tasks. To handle sparse trajectories effectively, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing densely sampled trajectories from sparsely sampled ones, allowing it to extract detailed spatio-temporal information from sparse trajectories. Experiments involving three representative trajectory-related tasks on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the intended properties performance of UVTM and offer evidence that UVTM is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPTraj-PM: Differentially Private Trajectory Synthesis Using Prefix Tree and Markov Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14106v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of GPS-enabled devices has generated a large amount of trajectory data. These data offer us vital insights to understand the movements of individuals and populations, benefiting a broad range of applications from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, improper release of trajectory data is increasing concerns on individual privacy. Previous attempts either lack strong privacy guarantees, or fail to preserve sufficient basic characteristics of the original data. In this paper, we propose DPTraj-PM, a method to synthesize trajectory dataset under the differential privacy (DP) framework while ensures high data utility. Based on the assumption that an individual's trajectory could be mainly determined by the initial trajectory segment (which depicts the starting point and the initial direction) and the next location point, DPTraj-PM discretizes the raw trajectories into neighboring cells, and models them by combining a prefix tree structure and an m-order Markov process. After adding noise to the model under differential privacy, DPTraj-PM generates a synthetic dataset from the noisy model to enable a wider spectrum of data mining and modeling tasks.

Nevertheless, existing studies typically ignore the confounding effects of geospatial context, leading to the acquisition of spurious correlations and limited generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we initially formulate a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to decipher the trajectory representation learning process from a causal perspective. Building upon the SCM, we further present a Trajectory modeling framework (TrajCL) based on Causal Learning, which leverages the backdoor adjustment theory as an intervention tool to eliminate the spurious correlations between geospatial context and trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify that TrajCL markedly enhances performance in trajectory classification tasks while showcasing superior generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a $\textit{direct multiple shooting technique}$ -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |

Current research predominantly focuses on traditional deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These methods leverage relative distances to forecast the motion trajectories of a single class of agents. However, in complex traffic scenarios, the motion patterns of various types of traffic participants exhibit inherent randomness and uncertainty. Relying solely on relative distances may not adequately capture the nuanced interaction patterns between different classes of road users. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class trajectory prediction method named the social force embedded mixed graph convolutional network (SFEM-GCN). SFEM-GCN comprises three graph topologies: the semantic graph (SG), position graph (PG), and velocity graph (VG). These graphs encode various of social force relationships among different classes of agents in complex scenes. Specifically, SG utilizes one-hot encoding of agent-class information to guide the construction of graph adjacency matrices based on semantic information. PG and VG create adjacency matrices to capture motion interaction relationships between different classes agents. These graph structures are then integrated into a mixed graph, where learning is conducted using a spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCNN). To further enhance prediction performance, we adopt temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to generate the predicted trajectory with fewer parameters. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that SFEM-GCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,3 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent vehicles</p></details> |

However, imitating trajectories that inadequately represent the original expert data can result in undesirable behaviors, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. We propose a trajectory augmentation method designed to maintain similarity with expert trajectory data. To accomplish this, we first cluster trajectories to identify minority yet safety-critical groups. Then, we combine the trajectories within the same cluster through geometrical transformation to create new trajectories. These trajectories are then added to the training dataset, provided that they meet our specified safety-related criteria. Our experiments exhibit that training an imitation learning model using these augmented trajectories can significantly improve closed-loop performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2024</p></details> |

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 CVPR AICity Workshop</p></details> |

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory prediction models based on the neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous attack methods have achieved high attack success rates but overlook the adaptability to realistic scenarios and the concealment of the deceits. To address this problem, we propose a speed-adaptive stealthy adversarial attack method named SA-Attack. This method searches the sensitive region of trajectory prediction models and generates the adversarial trajectories by using the vehicle-following method and incorporating information about forthcoming trajectories. Our method has the ability to adapt to different speed scenarios by reconstructing the trajectory from scratch. Fusing future trajectory trends and curvature constraints can guarantee the smoothness of adversarial trajectories, further ensuring the stealthiness of attacks. The empirical study on the datasets of nuScenes and Apolloscape demonstrates the attack performance of our proposed method. Finally, we also demonstrate the adaptability and stealthiness of SA-Attack for different speed scenarios.

The system utilizes information presently accessible to customers through smartphones and retail apps: motion data, store map, and purchase records. The approach eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers maintain full control of their data. Specifically, RetailOpt first employs inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are then cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through systematic experiments in five diverse environments. The proposed system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications, including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation. The potential application could also extend to other domains such as entertainment and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716v5)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrACT: A Training Dynamics Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Long-tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12538v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a safety critical task, autonomous driving requires accurate predictions of road users' future trajectories for safe motion planning, particularly under challenging conditions. Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | 22 pages |

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version and published in the "Early Access" area of IEEE Xplore for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles on 16 April 2024.

The field of motion prediction has seen large progress recently with state-of-the-Art (sotA) models achieving impressive results on large-scale public benchmarks. However, recent work revealed that learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be solved by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that leverages a Frenet representation of the scene, and that can be applied to SotA models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a comprehensive benchmark using two SotA motion prediction models. Our experiments show that this reduces the off-road rate on challenging scenarios by more than 90% without sacrificing average performance.</p></details> |  |

To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S4TP) framework. Specifically, S4TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV's planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S4TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs'trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S4TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within lowrisk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S4TP in terms of safety and rationality. S4TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,4 figures, published to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging. Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information. In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label. We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride. We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands. We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance. Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.

This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators. Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch`s t-test at a significance level of Alpha = 0.05, indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Due to the sensitive nature of the location data, directly sharing user trajectories suffers from privacy leakage issues. Local differential privacy (LDP), which perturbs sensitive data on the user side before it is shared or analyzed, emerges as a promising solution for private trajectory stream collection and analysis. Unfortunately, existing stream release approaches often neglect the rich spatial-temporal context information within trajectory streams, resulting in suboptimal utility and limited types of downstream applications. To this end, we propose RetraSyn, a novel real-time trajectory synthesis framework, which is able to perform on-the-fly trajectory synthesis based on the mobility patterns privately extracted from users' trajectory streams. Thus, the downstream trajectory analysis can be performed on the high-utility synthesized data with privacy protection. We also take the genuine behaviors of real-world mobile travelers into consideration, ensuring authenticity and practicality. The key components of RetraSyn include the global mobility model, dynamic mobility update mechanism, real-time synthesis, and adaptive allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets under various location-based utility metrics, encompassing both streaming and historical scenarios. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

Despite the recent advances in data-driven approaches, grasping remains an unsolved problem. Most of the works on this task are relying on priors and heavy constraints to avoid the exploration problem. Novelty Search (NS) refers to evolutionary algorithms that replace selection of best performing individuals with selection of the most novel ones. Such methods have already shown promising results on hard exploration problems. In this work, we introduce a new NS-based method that can generate large datasets of grasping trajectories in a platform-agnostic manner. Inspired by the hierarchical learning paradigm, our method decouples approach and prehension to make the behavioral space smoother. Experiments conducted on 3 different robot-gripper setups and on several standard objects shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art for generating diverse repertoire of grasping trajectories, getting a higher successful run ratio, as well as a better diversity for both approach and prehension. Some of the generated solutions have been successfully deployed on a real robot, showing the exploitability of the obtained repertoires.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-transmotion.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

The method utilizes swarming dynamics to simulate the motion of virtual agents along the stress produced in a loaded part. Agent trajectories are then used as print trajectories. With this approach, the complex global trajectory generation problem is subdivided into a set of sequential and computationally efficient quadratic programs. Through comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and experiments, we compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight a remarkable improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a 115x faster computation speed than existing methods. This efficiency, combined with the possibility to tune the trajectories spacing to match the deposition process constraints, makes the potential integration of our approach into existing 3D printing processes seamless. Additionally, the open-hole tensile specimen produced on a conventional fused filament fabrication set-up with our algorithm achieve a notable ~10% improvement in specific modulus compared to existing trajectory optimization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning using Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Overtaking Maneuvers in Autonomous Racing Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10658v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous racing are based on the sequential execution of prediction of the opposing vehicles and subsequent trajectory planning for the ego vehicle. If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed designs outperform various benchmark schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC) Spring, 2024</p></details> |

In practice, this is achieved by subgrouping, whereby clusters with similar patient characteristics are identified and then receive customized treatment plans with the goal of targeting subgroup-specific disease dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel mixture hidden Markov model for subgrouping patient trajectories from chronic diseases. Our model is probabilistic and carefully designed to capture different trajectory phases of chronic diseases (i.e., "severe", "moderate", and "mild") through tailored latent states. We demonstrate our subgrouping framework based on a longitudinal study across 847 patients with non-specific low back pain. Here, our subgrouping framework identifies 8 subgroups. Further, we show that our subgrouping framework outperforms common baselines in terms of cluster validity indices. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the model to other chronic and long-lasting diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming at Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Offline Trajectory Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories. Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts. However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation. Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6-D Trajectories for Omnidirectional Multirotor Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10392v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As fully-actuated systems, omnidirectional multirotor aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have more flexible maneuverability and advantages in aggressive flight in cluttered environments than traditional underactuated MAVs. %Due to the high dimensionality of configuration space, making the designed trajectory generation algorithm efficient is challenging. This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Generic Trajectory Planning Method for Constrained All-Wheel-Steering Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09677v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a trajectory planning method for wheeled robots with fixed steering axes while the steering angle of each wheel is constrained. In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

However, we observed that LCM struggles to generate images with both clarity and detailed intricacy. Consequently, we introduce Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD), which encompasses trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling. The trajectory consistency function diminishes the parameterisation and distillation errors by broadening the scope of the self-consistency boundary condition with trajectory mapping and endowing the TCD with the ability to accurately trace the entire trajectory of the Probability Flow ODE in semi-linear form with an Exponential Integrator. Additionally, strategic stochastic sampling provides explicit control of stochastic and circumvents the accumulated errors inherent in multi-step consistency sampling. Experiments demonstrate that TCD not only significantly enhances image quality at low NFEs but also yields more detailed results compared to the teacher model at high NFEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mhh0318.github.io/tcd</p></details> |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way.

In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model.

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06351v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

| **[Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proves challenging in tasks featuring scant rewards. These limited rewards merely signify whether the task is partially or entirely accomplished, necessitating various exploration actions before the agent garners meaningful feedback. Consequently, the majority of existing DRL exploration algorithms struggle to acquire practical policies within a reasonable timeframe. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach leveraging offline demonstration trajectories for swifter and more efficient online RL in environments with sparse rewards. Our pivotal insight involves treating offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, rather than mere imitation, allowing our method to learn a policy whose distribution of state-action visitation marginally matches that of offline demonstrations. We specifically introduce a novel trajectory distance relying on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and cast policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. We then illustrate that this optimization problem can be streamlined into a policy-gradient algorithm, integrating rewards shaped by insights from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm undergoes evaluation across extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and misleading rewards. The experimental findings demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed algorithm over baseline methods concerning diverse exploration and the acquisition of an optimal policy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRANP: A Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08004v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a vital component in autonomous driving, accurate trajectory prediction effectively prevents traffic accidents and improves driving efficiency. To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deadlock Resolution and Recursive Feasibility in MPC-based Multi-robot Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06071v4)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online collision-free trajectory generation within a shared workspace is fundamental for most multi-robot applications. However, many widely-used methods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on the feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a distributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where several robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as introducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to validate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method called infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The MPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered Voronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of deadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force equilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively detect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an adaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable deadlocks can exist under minor conditions. In addition, the proposed planning algorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each time step under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots and requires only local communication. Comprehensive simulation and experiment studies are conducted over large-scale multi-robot systems. Significant improvements on success rate are reported, in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and especially in crowded and high-speed scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Typically, this issue is addressed by providing low-level per-frame guidance in the form of edge maps, depth maps, or an existing video to be altered. However, the process of obtaining such guidance can be labor-intensive. This paper focuses on enhancing controllability in video synthesis by employing straightforward bounding boxes to guide the subject in various ways, all without the need for neural network training, finetuning, optimization at inference time, or the use of pre-existing videos. Our algorithm, TrailBlazer, is constructed upon a pre-trained (T2V) model, and easy to implement. The subject is directed by a bounding box through the proposed spatial and temporal attention map editing. Moreover, we introduce the concept of keyframing, allowing the subject trajectory and overall appearance to be guided by both a moving bounding box and corresponding prompts, without the need to provide a detailed mask. The method is efficient, with negligible additional computation relative to the underlying pre-trained model. Despite the simplicity of the bounding box guidance, the resulting motion is surprisingly natural, with emergent effects including perspective and movement toward the virtual camera as the box size increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://hohonu-vicml.github.io/Trailblazer.Page/</p></details> |

This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Design and Simulation of Time-energy Optimal Anti-swing Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Tower Cranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05581v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For autonomous crane lifting, optimal trajectories of the crane are required as reference inputs to the crane controller to facilitate feedforward control. Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW'24) as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments with Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

LfO can facilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and reducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a transformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and action pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation or inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While several existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity recognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However, SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single viewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the observed task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing occlusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and synchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present multi-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception of multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better recognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two distinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs under occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other baselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance under different ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecture components. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployable state-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI-2024 and 'Towards Reliable and Deployable Learning-Based Robotic Systems' Workshop at CoRL2023</p></details> |

In this regard, a common shortcoming of current benchmark datasets is their limitation to sets of sample trajectories and a lack of actual ground truth distributions, which prevents the use of more expressive error metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance for model evaluation. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic dataset generation based on composite probabilistic B\'ezier curves, which is capable of generating ground truth data in terms of probability distributions over full trajectories. This allows the calculation of arbitrary posterior distributions. The paper showcases an exemplary trajectory prediction model evaluation using generated ground truth distribution data.</p></details> |  |

The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS); 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. POP achieves comparable results to top-performing methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</p></details> |  |

GNNs effectively implement node representation learning through neighborhood aggregation and achieve impressive results in many graph-related tasks. However, most neighborhood aggregation approaches are summation-based, which can be problematic as they may not be sufficiently expressive to encode informative graph structures. Furthermore, though the graph pooling module is also of vital importance for graph learning, especially for the task of graph classification, research on graph down-sampling mechanisms is rather limited. To address the above challenges, we propose a concatenation-based graph convolution mechanism that injectively updates node representations to maximize the discriminative power in distinguishing non-isomorphic subgraphs. In addition, we design a novel graph pooling module, called WL-SortPool, to learn important subgraph patterns in a deep-learning manner. WL-SortPool layer-wise sorts node representations (i.e. continuous WL colors) to separately learn the relative importance of subtrees with different depths for the purpose of classification, thus better characterizing the complex graph topology and rich information encoded in the graph. We propose a novel Subgraph Pattern GNN (SPGNN) architecture that incorporates these enhancements. We test the proposed SPGNN architecture on many graph classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method can achieve highly competitive results with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other GNN approaches.</p></details> |  |

A typical approach is to rely on Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures, which encode inputs in high-dimensional latent spaces that are repeatedly transformed during the execution of the algorithm. In this work we perform a detailed analysis of the structure of the latent space induced by the GNN when executing algorithms. We identify two possible failure modes: (i) loss of resolution, making it hard to distinguish similar values; (ii) inability to deal with values outside the range observed during training. We propose to solve the first issue by relying on a softmax aggregator, and propose to decay the latent space in order to deal with out-of-range values.

Although the ability to handle less-homophilic graphs is restricted, classical GNNs still stand out in several nice properties such as efficiency, simplicity, and explainability. In this work, we propose a novel graph restructuring method that can be integrated into any type of GNNs, including classical GNNs, to leverage the benefits of existing GNNs while alleviating their limitations. Our contribution is threefold: a) learning the weight of pseudo-eigenvectors for an adaptive spectral clustering that aligns well with known node labels, b) proposing a new density-aware homophilic metric that is robust to label imbalance, and c) reconstructing the adjacency matrix based on the result of adaptive spectral clustering to maximize the homophilic scores. The experimental results show that our graph restructuring method can significantly boost the performance of six classical GNNs by an average of 25% on less-homophilic graphs. The boosted performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Intrusion Detection Systems play a crucial role in ensuring network security, actively identifying and mitigating malicious behaviours. However, the relentless advancement of cyber-threats has rendered traditional/classical approaches insufficient in addressing the sophistication and complexity of attacks. This paper proposes a novel 3-stage intrusion detection system inspired by a simplified version of the Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain to detect advanced multi-step attacks. The proposed approach consists of three models, each responsible for detecting a group of attacks with common characteristics. The detection outcome of the first two stages is used to conduct a feasibility study on the possibility of predicting attacks in the third stage. Using the ToN IoT dataset, we achieved an average of 94% F1-Score among different stages, outperforming the benchmark approaches based on Random-forest model. Finally, we comment on the feasibility of this approach to be integrated in a real-world system and propose various possible future work.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Mesh Optimization of a Hybrid Deep Learning Black-Box PDE Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11766v2)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in computational fluid dynamics. Recent research proposed a PDE correction framework that leverages deep learning to correct the solution obtained by a PDE solver on a coarse mesh. However, end-to-end training of such a PDE correction model over both solver-dependent parameters such as mesh parameters and neural network parameters requires the PDE solver to support automatic differentiation through the iterative numerical process. Such a feature is not readily available in many existing solvers. In this study, we explore the feasibility of end-to-end training of a hybrid model with a black-box PDE solver and a deep learning model for fluid flow prediction. Specifically, we investigate a hybrid model that integrates a black-box PDE solver into a differentiable deep graph neural network. To train this model, we use a zeroth-order gradient estimator to differentiate the PDE solver via forward propagation. Although experiments show that the proposed approach based on zeroth-order gradient estimation underperforms the baseline that computes exact derivatives using automatic differentiation, our proposed method outperforms the baseline trained with a frozen input mesh to the solver. Moreover, with a simple warm-start on the neural network parameters, we show that models trained by these zeroth-order algorithms achieve an accelerated convergence and improved generalization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A survey of dynamic graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18211v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for effectively mining and learning from graph-structured data, with applications spanning numerous domains. However, most research focuses on static graphs, neglecting the dynamic nature of real-world networks where topologies and attributes evolve over time. By integrating sequence modeling modules into traditional GNN architectures, dynamic GNNs aim to bridge this gap, capturing the inherent temporal dependencies of dynamic graphs for a more authentic depiction of complex networks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts, key techniques, and state-of-the-art dynamic GNN models. We present the mainstream dynamic GNN models in detail and categorize models based on how temporal information is incorporated. We also discuss large-scale dynamic GNNs and pre-training techniques. Although dynamic GNNs have shown superior performance, challenges remain in scalability, handling heterogeneous information, and lack of diverse graph datasets. The paper also discusses possible future directions, such as adaptive and memory-enhanced models, inductive learning, and theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

We use a family of recently-discovered decidable logics involving "Presburger quantifiers". We show how to use these logics to measure the expressiveness of classes of GNNs, in some cases getting exact correspondences between the expressiveness of logics and GNNs. We also employ the logics, and the techniques used to analyze them, to obtain decision procedures for verification problems over GNNs. We complement this with undecidability results for static analysis problems involving the logics, as well as for GNN verification problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Gradient Descent for Gaussian Processes Done Right](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20581v2)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As is well known, both sampling from the posterior and computing the mean of the posterior in Gaussian process regression reduces to solving a large linear system of equations. We study the use of stochastic gradient descent for solving this linear system, and show that when \emph{done right} -- by which we mean using specific insights from the optimisation and kernel communities -- stochastic gradient descent is highly effective. To that end, we introduce a particularly simple \emph{stochastic dual descent} algorithm, explain its design in an intuitive manner and illustrate the design choices through a series of ablation studies. Further experiments demonstrate that our new method is highly competitive. In particular, our evaluations on the UCI regression tasks and on Bayesian optimisation set our approach apart from preconditioned conjugate gradients and variational Gaussian process approximations. Moreover, our method places Gaussian process regression on par with state-of-the-art graph neural networks for molecular binding affinity prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaDRec: Contextualized and Debiased Recommender Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06895v2)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender models aimed at mining users' behavioral patterns have raised great attention as one of the essential applications in daily life. Recent work on graph neural networks (GNNs) or debiasing methods has attained remarkable gains. However, they still suffer from (1) over-smoothing node embeddings caused by recursive convolutions with GNNs, and (2) the skewed distribution of interactions due to popularity and user-individual biases. This paper proposes a contextualized and debiased recommender model (CaDRec). To overcome the over-smoothing issue, we explore a novel hypergraph convolution operator that can select effective neighbors during convolution by introducing both structural context and sequential context. To tackle the skewed distribution, we propose two strategies for disentangling interactions: (1) modeling individual biases to learn unbiased item embeddings, and (2) incorporating item popularity with positional encoding. Moreover, we mathematically show that the imbalance of the gradients to update item embeddings exacerbates the popularity bias, thus adopting regularization and weighting schemes as solutions. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the CaDRec against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/CaDRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating. In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback. To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations. Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process. The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/NFARec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

However, deploying these approaches for large-scale networks poses significant challenges. In this paper, we leverage the power of heterogeneous graph neural networks to propose a novel data-driven approach for end-to-end traffic assignment and traffic flow learning. Our model integrates an adaptive graph attention mechanism with auxiliary "virtual" links connecting origin-destination node pairs, This integration enables the model to capture spatial traffic patterns across different links, By incorporating the node-based flow conservation law into the overall loss function, the model ensures the prediction results in compliance with flow conservation principles, resulting in highly accurate predictions for both link flow and flow-capacity ratios. We present numerical experiments on urban transportation networks and show that the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model outperforms other conventional neural network models in terms of convergence rate and prediction accuracy. Notably, by introducing two different training strategies, the proposed heterogeneous graph neural network model can also be generalized to different network topologies. This approach offers a promising solution for complex traffic flow analysis and prediction, enhancing our understanding and management of a wide range of transportation systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

By gaining a better understanding of what makes a good outfit, companies can provide useful product recommendations to their users. In this project, we follow two existing approaches that employ graphs to represent outfits and use modified versions of the Graph neural network (GNN) frameworks. Both Node-wise Graph Neural Network (NGNN) and Hypergraph Neural Network aim to score a set of items according to the outfit compatibility of items. The data used is the Polyvore Dataset which consists of curated outfits with product images and text descriptions for each product in an outfit. We recreate the analysis on a subset of this data and compare the two existing models on their performance on two tasks Fill in the blank (FITB): finding an item that completes an outfit, and Compatibility prediction: estimating compatibility of different items grouped as an outfit. We can replicate the results directionally and find that HGNN does have a slightly better performance on both tasks. On top of replicating the results of the two papers we also tried to use embeddings generated from a vision transformer and witness enhanced prediction accuracy across the board</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Graph Neural Neural Network-based Fault Localization Through Enhanced Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04496v4)** | 2024-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software fault localization plays an important role in software quality assurance by pinpointing faulty locations for easier debugging. Coverage-based fault localization, a widely used technique, employs statistics on coverage spectra to rank code based on suspiciousness scores. However, the rigidity of statistical approaches calls for learning-based techniques. Amongst all, Grace, a graph-neural network (GNN) based technique has achieved state-of-the-art due to its capacity to preserve coverage spectra, i.e., test-to-source coverage relationships, as precise abstract syntax-enhanced graph representation, mitigating the limitation of other learning-based technique which compresses the feature representation. However, such representation struggles with scalability due to the increasing complexity of software and associated coverage spectra and AST graphs. In this work, we proposed a new graph representation, DepGraph, that reduces the complexity of the graph representation by 70% in nodes and edges by integrating interprocedural call graph in the graph representation of the code. Moreover, we integrate additional features such as code change information in the graph as attributes so the model can leverage rich historical project data. We evaluate DepGraph using Defects4j 2.0.0, and it outperforms Grace by locating 20% more faults in Top-1 and improving the Mean First Rank (MFR) and the Mean Average Rank (MAR) by over 50% while decreasing GPU memory usage by 44% and training/inference time by 85%. Additionally, in cross-project settings, DepGraph surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline with a 42% higher Top-1 accuracy, and 68% and 65% improvement in MFR and MAR, respectively. Our study demonstrates DepGraph's robustness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability for future extension and adoption.</p></details> |  |

Recently, studies revealed their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we theoretically define the concept of expected robustness in the context of attributed graphs and relate it to the classical definition of adversarial robustness in the graph representation learning literature. Our definition allows us to derive an upper bound of the expected robustness of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks subject to node feature attacks. Building on these findings, we connect the expected robustness of GNNs to the orthonormality of their weight matrices and consequently propose an attack-independent, more robust variant of the GCN, called the Graph Convolutional Orthonormal Robust Networks (GCORNs). We further introduce a probabilistic method to estimate the expected robustness, which allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of GCORN on several real-world datasets. Experimental experiments showed that GCORN outperforms available defense methods.

| **[Towards Cross Domain Generalization of Hamiltonian Representation via Meta Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01168v4)** | 2024-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning for physics have focused on discovering shared representations of target systems by incorporating physics priors or inductive biases into neural networks. While effective, these methods are limited to the system domain, where the type of system remains consistent and thus cannot ensure the adaptation to new, or unseen physical systems governed by different laws. For instance, a neural network trained on a mass-spring system cannot guarantee accurate predictions for the behavior of a two-body system or any other system with different physical laws. In this work, we take a significant leap forward by targeting cross domain generalization within the field of Hamiltonian dynamics. We model our system with a graph neural network (GNN) and employ a meta learning algorithm to enable the model to gain experience over a distribution of systems and make it adapt to new physics. Our approach aims to learn a unified Hamiltonian representation that is generalizable across multiple system domains, thereby overcoming the limitations of system-specific models. We demonstrate that the meta-trained model captures the generalized Hamiltonian representation that is consistent across different physical domains. Overall, through the use of meta learning, we offer a framework that achieves cross domain generalization, providing a step towards a unified model for understanding a wide array of dynamical systems via deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new multi-teacher distillation method based on bi-level optimization (namely BO-NNC), to conduct noisy node classification on the graph data. Specifically, we first employ multiple self-supervised learning methods to train diverse teacher models, and then aggregate their predictions through a teacher weight matrix. Furthermore, we design a new bi-level optimization strategy to dynamically adjust the teacher weight matrix based on the training progress of the student model. Finally, we design a label improvement module to improve the label quality. Extensive experimental results on real datasets show that our method achieves the best results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation from the Perspective of Graph Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17862v1)** | 2024-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently capturing consistent and complementary semantic features in a multimodal conversation context is crucial for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC). Existing methods mainly use graph structures to model dialogue context semantic dependencies and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture multimodal semantic features for emotion recognition. However, these methods are limited by some inherent characteristics of GNN, such as over-smoothing and low-pass filtering, resulting in the inability to learn long-distance consistency information and complementary information efficiently. Since consistency and complementarity information correspond to low-frequency and high-frequency information, respectively, this paper revisits the problem of multimodal emotion recognition in conversation from the perspective of the graph spectrum. Specifically, we propose a Graph-Spectrum-based Multimodal Consistency and Complementary collaborative learning framework GS-MCC. First, GS-MCC uses a sliding window to construct a multimodal interaction graph to model conversational relationships and uses efficient Fourier graph operators to extract long-distance high-frequency and low-frequency information, respectively. Then, GS-MCC uses contrastive learning to construct self-supervised signals that reflect complementarity and consistent semantic collaboration with high and low-frequency signals, thereby improving the ability of high and low-frequency information to reflect real emotions. Finally, GS-MCC inputs the collaborative high and low-frequency information into the MLP network and softmax function for emotion prediction. Extensive experiments have proven the superiority of the GS-MCC architecture proposed in this paper on two benchmark data sets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Despite their effectiveness, their adoption has not been pervasive because of scalability challenges associated with large-scale graph datasets, particularly when leveraging message passing. To tackle these challenges, we introduce NeuraChip, a novel GNN spatial accelerator based on Gustavson's algorithm. NeuraChip decouples the multiplication and addition computations in sparse matrix multiplication. This separation allows for independent exploitation of their unique data dependencies, facilitating efficient resource allocation. We introduce a rolling eviction strategy to mitigate data idling in on-chip memory as well as address the prevalent issue of memory bloat in sparse graph computations. Furthermore, the compute resource load balancing is achieved through a dynamic reseeding hash-based mapping, ensuring uniform utilization of computing resources agnostic of sparsity patterns. Finally, we present NeuraSim, an open-source, cycle-accurate, multi-threaded, modular simulator for comprehensive performance analysis. Overall, NeuraChip presents a significant improvement, yielding an average speedup of 22.1x over Intel's MKL, 17.1x over NVIDIA's cuSPARSE, 16.7x over AMD's hipSPARSE, and 1.5x over prior state-of-the-art SpGEMM accelerator and 1.3x over GNN accelerator.

However, despite their impressive performance, the fairness problem has increasingly gained attention as a crucial aspect to consider. Existing research in graph learning focuses on either group fairness or individual fairness. However, since each concept provides unique insights into fairness from distinct perspectives, integrating them into a fair graph neural network system is crucial. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet to comprehensively tackle both individual and group fairness simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new concept of individual fairness within groups and a novel framework named Fairness for Group and Individual (FairGI), which considers both group fairness and individual fairness within groups in the context of graph learning. FairGI employs the similarity matrix of individuals to achieve individual fairness within groups, while leveraging adversarial learning to address group fairness in terms of both Equal Opportunity and Statistical Parity. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of group fairness and individual fairness within groups, but also exhibits excellent performance in population-level individual fairness, while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing deep-learning-based methods for modeling network routing are not able to extrapolate towards unseen feature distributions. Nor are they able to handle scaled and drifted network attributes in test sets that include open-world inputs. To deal with these challenges, we propose a novel approach for modeling network routing, using Graph Neural Networks. Our method can also be used for network-latency estimation. Supported by a domain-knowledge-assisted graph formulation, our model shares a stable performance across different network sizes and configurations of routing networks, while at the same time being able to extrapolate towards unseen sizes, configurations, and user behavior. We show that our model outperforms most conventional deep-learning-based models, in terms of prediction accuracy, computational resources, inference speed, as well as ability to generalize towards open-world input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IJCNN 2022</p></details> |

Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible. Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based optimization.</p></details> |  |

The utility of ZX-diagrams relies on a set of local transformation rules that can be applied to them without changing the underlying quantum process they describe. These rules can be exploited to optimize the structure of ZX-diagrams for a range of applications. However, finding an optimal sequence of transformation rules is generally an open problem. In this work, we bring together ZX-diagrams with reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique designed to discover an optimal sequence of actions in a decision-making problem and show that a trained reinforcement learning agent can significantly outperform other optimization techniques like a greedy strategy or simulated annealing.

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 20 figures submitted to CMAME (Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering)</p></details> |

While single-drug effects on cell lines are well-documented, the scarcity of data on drug synergy, considering the vast array of potential drug combinations, prompts a growing interest in computational approaches for predicting synergies in untested drug pairs. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (\textit{GNN}) based model for drug synergy prediction, which utilizes drug chemical structures and cell line gene expression data. We extract data from the largest available drug combination database (DrugComb) and generate multiple synergy scores (commonly used in the literature) to create seven datasets that serve as a reliable benchmark with high confidence. In contrast to conventional models relying on pre-computed chemical features, our GNN-based approach learns task-specific drug representations directly from the graph structure of the drugs, providing superior performance in predicting drug synergies. Our work suggests that learning task-specific drug representations and leveraging a diverse dataset is a promising approach to advancing our understanding of drug-drug interaction and synergy.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairGT: A Fairness-aware Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17169v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of Graph Transformers (GTs) generally neglects considerations for fairness, resulting in biased outcomes against certain sensitive subgroups. Since GTs encode graph information without relying on message-passing mechanisms, conventional fairness-aware graph learning methods cannot be directly applicable to address these issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose FairGT, a Fairness-aware Graph Transformer explicitly crafted to mitigate fairness concerns inherent in GTs. FairGT incorporates a meticulous structural feature selection strategy and a multi-hop node feature integration method, ensuring independence of sensitive features and bolstering fairness considerations. These fairness-aware graph information encodings seamlessly integrate into the Transformer framework for downstream tasks. We also prove that the proposed fair structural topology encoding with adjacency matrix eigenvector selection and multi-hop integration are theoretically effective. Empirical evaluations conducted across five real-world datasets demonstrate FairGT's superiority in fairness metrics over existing graph transformers, graph neural networks, and state-of-the-art fairness-aware graph learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPGAN: A Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network for Missing Data Imputation in Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17164v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data imputation poses a paramount challenge when dealing with graph data. Prior works typically are based on feature propagation or graph autoencoders to address this issue. However, these methods usually encounter the over-smoothing issue when dealing with missing data, as the graph neural network (GNN) modules are not explicitly designed for handling missing data. This paper proposes a novel framework, called Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network (DPGAN), that can deal simultaneously with missing data and avoid over-smoothing problems. The crux of our work is that it admits both global and local representations of the input graph signal, which can capture the long-range dependencies. It is realized via our proposed generator, consisting of two key components, i.e., MLPUNet++ and GraphUNet++. Our generator is trained with a designated discriminator via an adversarial process. In particular, to avoid assessing the entire graph as did in the literature, our discriminator focuses on the local subgraph fidelity, thereby boosting the quality of the local imputation. The subgraph size is adjustable, allowing for control over the intensity of adversarial regularization. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmark datasets substantiate that DPGAN consistently rivals, if not outperforms, existing state-of-the-art imputation algorithms.

| **[HiHGNN: Accelerating HGNNs through Parallelism and Data Reusability Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12765v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as powerful algorithms for processing heterogeneous graphs (HetGs), widely used in many critical fields. To capture both structural and semantic information in HetGs, HGNNs first aggregate the neighboring feature vectors for each vertex in each semantic graph and then fuse the aggregated results across all semantic graphs for each vertex. Unfortunately, existing graph neural network accelerators are ill-suited to accelerate HGNNs. This is because they fail to efficiently tackle the specific execution patterns and exploit the high-degree parallelism as well as data reusability inside and across the processing of semantic graphs in HGNNs. In this work, we first quantitatively characterize a set of representative HGNN models on GPU to disclose the execution bound of each stage, inter-semantic-graph parallelism, and inter-semantic-graph data reusability in HGNNs. Guided by our findings, we propose a high-performance HGNN accelerator, HiHGNN, to alleviate the execution bound and exploit the newfound parallelism and data reusability in HGNNs. Specifically, we first propose a bound-aware stage-fusion methodology that tailors to HGNN acceleration, to fuse and pipeline the execution stages being aware of their execution bounds.

Since the construction details are unknown for attackers in a black-box scenario, it is unrealistic to conduct the classical adversarial attacks that require a specific adjacency matrix. In this paper, we propose the first general black-box adversarial attack framework, i.e., General Attack via Fake Social Interaction (GAFSI), against detectors based on different graph structures. Specifically, as sharing is an important social interaction for GNN-based fake news detectors to construct the graph, we simulate sharing behaviors to fool the detectors. Firstly, we propose a fraudster selection module to select engaged users leveraging local and global information. In addition, a post injection module guides the selected users to create shared relations by sending posts. The sharing records will be added to the social context, leading to a general attack against different detectors. Experimental results on empirical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GAFSI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2024</p></details> |

Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND employs the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties of fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting. Experimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs.

Recent advancements utilize graph convolutional neural networks to extract features within graph structures. Despite promising results, these methods face challenges in real-world applications due to sparse features, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Recent studies draw inspiration from the mammalian brain and employ spiking neural networks to model and learn graph structures. However, these approaches are limited to traditional Von Neumann-based computing systems, which still face hardware inefficiencies. In this study, we present a fully neuromorphic implementation of spiking graph neural networks designed for Loihi 2. We optimize network parameters using Lava Bayesian Optimization, a novel hyperparameter optimization system compatible with neuromorphic computing architectures. We showcase the performance benefits of combining neuromorphic Bayesian optimization with our approach for citation graph classification using fixed-precision spiking neurons.

Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.</p></details> |  |

To that end, we propose a method to extract global concept explanations from the predictions of graph neural networks to develop a deeper understanding of the tasks underlying structure-property relationships. We identify concept explanations as dense clusters in the self-explaining Megan models subgraph latent space. For each concept, we optimize a representative prototype graph and optionally use GPT-4 to provide hypotheses about why each structure has a certain effect on the prediction. We conduct computational experiments on synthetic and real-world graph property prediction tasks. For the synthetic tasks we find that our method correctly reproduces the structural rules by which they were created. For real-world molecular property regression and classification tasks, we find that our method rediscovers established rules of thumb. More specifically, our results for molecular mutagenicity prediction indicate more fine-grained resolution of structural details than existing explainability methods, consistent with previous results from chemistry literature. Overall, our results show promising capability to extract the underlying structure-property relationships for complex graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, accepted at xAI world conference 2024</p></details> |

The dataset comprises bone marrow samples from 30 patients, with each cell characterized by twelve markers. Ground truth labels identify five hematological cell types: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Monocytes, Mast cells, and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs). Experiments utilize supervised inductive learning and semi-supervised transductive learning on up to 1 million cells per patient. Baseline methods include Gaussian Mixture Models, XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs demonstrate superior performance by exploiting spatial relationships in graph-encoded data. The benchmark allows standardized evaluation of clinically relevant classification tasks, along with exploratory analyses to gain insights into hematological cell phenotypes.

| **[IDEA: Invariant Defense for Graph Adversarial Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15792v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of graph neural networks (GNNs), their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses tremendous challenges for practical applications. Existing defense methods suffer from severe performance decline under unseen attacks, due to either limited observed adversarial examples or pre-defined heuristics. To address these limitations, we analyze the causalities in graph adversarial attacks and conclude that causal features are key to achieve graph adversarial robustness, owing to their determinedness for labels and invariance across attacks. To learn these causal features, we innovatively propose an Invariant causal DEfense method against adversarial Attacks (IDEA). We derive node-based and structure-based invariance objectives from an information-theoretic perspective. IDEA ensures strong predictability for labels and invariant predictability across attacks, which is provably a causally invariant defense across various attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDEA attains state-of-the-art defense performance under all five attacks on all five datasets.

| **[Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16366v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised graph anomaly detection aims at identifying rare patterns that deviate from the majority in a graph without the aid of labels, which is important for a variety of real-world applications. Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from solely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G3AD can outperform seventeen state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

We present several error metrics that gauge the model's ability to predict the failure size, the final grid state, and the failure time steps of each branch within the cascade. We benchmark the graph neural network model against influence models. We show that, in addition to being generic over randomly scaled power injection values, the graph neural network model outperforms multiple influence models that are built specifically for their corresponding loading profiles.

| **[Gradformer: Graph Transformer with Exponential Decay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15729v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated their advantages across a wide range of tasks. However, the self-attention mechanism in GTs overlooks the graph's inductive biases, particularly biases related to structure, which are crucial for the graph tasks. Although some methods utilize positional encoding and attention bias to model inductive biases, their effectiveness is still suboptimal analytically. Therefore, this paper presents Gradformer, a method innovatively integrating GT with the intrinsic inductive bias by applying an exponential decay mask to the attention matrix. Specifically, the values in the decay mask matrix diminish exponentially, correlating with the decreasing node proximities within the graph structure. This design enables Gradformer to retain its ability to capture information from distant nodes while focusing on the graph's local details. Furthermore, Gradformer introduces a learnable constraint into the decay mask, allowing different attention heads to learn distinct decay masks. Such an design diversifies the attention heads, enabling a more effective assimilation of diverse structural information within the graph. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Gradformer consistently outperforms the Graph Neural Network and GT baseline models in various graph classification and regression tasks. Additionally, Gradformer has proven to be an effective method for training deep GT models, maintaining or even enhancing accuracy compared to shallow models as the network deepens, in contrast to the significant accuracy drop observed in other GT models.Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/LiuChuang0059/Gradformer}.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Bridging the Semantic-Numerical Gap: A Numerical Reasoning Method of Cross-modal Knowledge Graph for Material Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09744v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using machine learning (ML) techniques to predict material properties is a crucial research topic. These properties depend on numerical data and semantic factors. Due to the limitations of small-sample datasets, existing methods typically adopt ML algorithms to regress numerical properties or transfer other pre-trained knowledge graphs (KGs) to the material. However, these methods cannot simultaneously handle semantic and numerical information. In this paper, we propose a numerical reasoning method for material KGs (NR-KG), which constructs a cross-modal KG using semantic nodes and numerical proxy nodes. It captures both types of information by projecting KG into a canonical KG and utilizes a graph neural network to predict material properties. In this process, a novel projection prediction loss is proposed to extract semantic features from numerical information. NR-KG facilitates end-to-end processing of cross-modal data, mining relationships and cross-modal information in small-sample datasets, and fully utilizes valuable experimental data to enhance material prediction. We further propose two new High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) property datasets with semantic descriptions. NR-KG outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving relative improvements of 25.9% and 16.1% on two material datasets. Besides, NR-KG surpasses SOTA methods on two public physical chemistry molecular datasets, showing improvements of 22.2% and 54.3%, highlighting its potential application and generalizability. We hope the proposed datasets, algorithms, and pre-trained models can facilitate the communities of KG and AI for materials.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent code embedding approach for vulnerability detection, owing to their ability to capture the underlying semantic structure of source code. However, GNNs face significant challenges in explainability due to their inherently black-box nature. To this end, several factual reasoning-based explainers have been proposed. These explainers provide explanations for the predictions made by GNNs by analyzing the key features that contribute to the outcomes. We argue that these factual reasoning-based explanations cannot answer critical what-if questions: What would happen to the GNN's decision if we were to alter the code graph into alternative structures? Inspired by advancements of counterfactual reasoning in artificial intelligence, we propose CFExplainer, a novel counterfactual explainer for GNN-based vulnerability detection. Unlike factual reasoning-based explainers, CFExplainer seeks the minimal perturbation to the input code graph that leads to a change in the prediction, thereby addressing the what-if questions for vulnerability detection. We term this perturbation a counterfactual explanation, which can pinpoint the root causes of the detected vulnerability and furnish valuable insights for developers to undertake appropriate actions for fixing the vulnerability. Extensive experiments on four GNN-based vulnerability detection models demonstrate the effectiveness of CFExplainer over existing state-of-the-art factual reasoning-based explainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted in the proceedings of the 33nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2024)</p></details> |

However, training and assessing numerous architectures introduces considerable computational overhead. One method to mitigating this is through performance predictors, which offer a means to estimate the potential of an architecture without exhaustive training. Given that neural architectures fundamentally resemble Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become an apparent choice for such predictive tasks. Nevertheless, the scarcity of training data can impact the precision of GNN-based predictors. To address this, we introduce a novel GNN predictor for NAS. This predictor renders neural architectures into vector representations by combining both the conventional and inverse graph views. Additionally, we incorporate a customized training loss within the GNN predictor to ensure efficient utilization of both types of representations. We subsequently assessed our method through experiments on benchmark datasets including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and the DARTS search space, with a training dataset ranging from 50 to 400 samples. Benchmarked against leading GNN predictors, the experimental results showcase a significant improvement in prediction accuracy, with a 3%--16% increase in Kendall-tau correlation.

Capturing contextual information from textual data for event forecasting poses significant challenges due to the intricate structure of the documents and the evolving nature of events. Recently, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of input text graphs. However, these models only utilize node-level representation, causing the loss of the global information from graph-level representation. On the other hand, both node-level and graph-level representations are essential for effective event prediction as node-level representation gives insight into the local structure, and the graph-level representation provides an understanding of the global structure of the temporal graph. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL employs a local view encoder to learn the evolving node representations, which effectively captures the local dynamic structure of input graphs. Additionally, it harnesses a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Then we update the graph representations from both encoders using contrastive learning. In the final stage, DyGCL combines both representations using an attention mechanism and optimizes its capability to predict future events. Our extensive experiment demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods for event prediction on six real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, beam training for mmWave ELAA systems is challenged by excessive pilot overheads as well as insufficient accuracy, as the huge near-field codebook has to be accounted for. In this paper, inspired by the similarity between far-field sub-6 GHz channels and near-field mmWave channels, we propose to leverage sub-6 GHz uplink pilot signals to directly estimate the optimal near-field mmWave codeword, which aims to reduce pilot overhead and bypass the channel estimation. Moreover, we adopt deep learning to perform this dual mapping function, i.e., sub-6 GHz to mmWave, far-field to near-field, and a novel neural network structure called NMBEnet is designed to enhance the precision of beam training. Specifically, when considering the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication scenarios with high user density, correlations arise both between signals from different users and between signals from different subcarriers. Accordingly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) module and graph neural network (GNN) module included in the proposed NMBEnet can leverage these two correlations to further enhance the precision of beam training.</p></details> |  |

Although graph neural network (GNN)-based models have achieved high performance in LP, understanding why they perform well is challenging because most comprise complex neural networks. We employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method that helps analyze the topological information of graphs, to explain the reasons for the high performance. We propose a novel method that employs PH for LP (PHLP) focusing on how the presence or absence of target links influences the overall topology. The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, PHLP is the first method of applying PH to LP without GNNs. The proposed approach, employing PH while not relying on neural networks, enables the identification of crucial factors for improving performance.</p></details> |  |

They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes. We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets.</p></details> | under review |

Recent works focused on designing self-supervised pre-training tasks to extract useful and universal transferable knowledge from large-scale unlabeled data. However, they have to face an inevitable question: traditional pre-training strategies that aim at extracting useful information about pre-training tasks, may not extract all useful information about the downstream task. In this paper, we reexamine the pre-training process within traditional pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks from the perspective of Information Bottleneck (IB) and confirm that the forgetting phenomenon in pre-training phase may cause detrimental effects on downstream tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel \underline{D}elayed \underline{B}ottlenecking \underline{P}re-training (DBP) framework which maintains as much as possible mutual information between latent representations and training data during pre-training phase by suppressing the compression operation and delays the compression operation to fine-tuning phase to make sure the compression can be guided with labeled fine-tuning data and downstream tasks. To achieve this, we design two information control objectives that can be directly optimized and further integrate them into the actual model design. Extensive experiments on both chemistry and biology domains demonstrate the effectiveness of DBP.</p></details> |  |

Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML's generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference. Furthermore, we investigate various applications and discuss the potential future directions in this promising field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CNN2GNN: How to Bridge CNN with GNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14822v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved excellent performance in vision tasks by extracting the intra-sample representation, it will take a higher training expense because of stacking numerous convolutional layers. Recently, as the bilinear models, graph neural networks (GNN) have succeeded in exploring the underlying topological relationship among the graph data with a few graph neural layers. Unfortunately, it cannot be directly utilized on non-graph data due to the lack of graph structure and has high inference latency on large-scale scenarios. Inspired by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, \textit{we discuss a natural question, how to bridge these two heterogeneous networks?} In this paper, we propose a novel CNN2GNN framework to unify CNN and GNN together via distillation. Firstly, to break the limitations of GNN, a differentiable sparse graph learning module is designed as the head of networks to dynamically learn the graph for inductive learning. Then, a response-based distillation is introduced to transfer the knowledge from CNN to GNN and bridge these two heterogeneous networks. Notably, due to extracting the intra-sample representation of a single instance and the topological relationship among the datasets simultaneously, the performance of distilled ``boosted'' two-layer GNN on Mini-ImageNet is much higher than CNN containing dozens of layers such as ResNet152.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Code Vulnerability Detection: Combining Code Language Models and Code Property Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14719v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, deep learning successfully applies to code vulnerability detection by learning from code sequences or property graphs. However, sequence-based methods often overlook essential code attributes such as syntax, control flow, and data dependencies, whereas graph-based approaches might underestimate the semantics of code and face challenges in capturing long-distance contextual information. To address this gap, we propose Vul-LMGNN, a unified model that combines pre-trained code language models with code property graphs for code vulnerability detection. Vul-LMGNN constructs a code property graph that integrates various code attributes (including syntax, flow control, and data dependencies) into a unified graph structure, thereafter leveraging pre-trained code model to extract local semantic features as node embeddings in the code property graph. Furthermore, to effectively retain dependency information among various attributes, we introduce a gated code Graph Neural Network (GNN). By jointly training the code language model and the gated code GNN modules in Vul-LMGNN, our proposed method efficiently leverages the strengths of both mechanisms. Finally, we utilize a pre-trained CodeBERT as an auxiliary classifier, with the final detection results derived by learning the linear interpolation of Vul-LMGNN and CodeBERT. The proposed method, evaluated across four real-world vulnerability datasets, demonstrated superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art approaches. Our source code could be accessed via the link: https://github.com/Vul-LMGNN/vul-LMGGNN.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community search (CS) aims to identify a set of nodes based on a specified query, leveraging structural cohesiveness and attribute homogeneity. This task enjoys various applications, ranging from fraud detection to recommender systems. In contrast to algorithm-based approaches, graph neural network (GNN) based methods define communities using ground truth labels, leveraging prior knowledge to explore patterns from graph structures and node features. However, existing solutions face three major limitations: 1) GNN-based models primarily focus on the disjoint community structure, disregarding the nature of nodes belonging to multiple communities. 2) These model structures suffer from low-order awareness and severe efficiency issues. 3) The identified community is subject to the free-rider and boundary effects. In this paper, we propose Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), which consist of three designs. First, we introduce a subspace community embedding technique called Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF). SSF enables the projection of community embeddings into distinct vector subspaces, accommodating the nature of overlapping and nesting community structures. In addition, we propose a lightweight model structure and a hop-wise attention mechanism to capture high-order patterns while improving model efficiency. Furthermore, two search algorithms are developed to minimize the latent space's community radius, addressing the challenges of free-rider and boundary effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. SMN achieves 14.73% improvements in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency.</p></details> |  |

These models necessitate effective uncertainty quantification to ensure reliable decision-making amid the challenges posed by model training discrepancies and unpredictable testing scenarios. This survey examines recent works that address uncertainty quantification within the model architectures, training, and inference of GNNs and PGMs. We aim to provide an overview of the current landscape of uncertainty in graphical models by organizing the recent methods into uncertainty representation and handling. By summarizing state-of-the-art methods, this survey seeks to deepen the understanding of uncertainty quantification in graphical models, thereby increasing their effectiveness and safety in critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Graph Neural Networks with HL-HGAT: A Hodge-Laplacian and Attention Mechanism Approach for Heterogeneous Graph-Structured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06687v2)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven effective in capturing relationships among nodes in a graph. This study introduces a novel perspective by considering a graph as a simplicial complex, encompassing nodes, edges, triangles, and $k$-simplices, enabling the definition of graph-structured data on any $k$-simplices. Our contribution is the Hodge-Laplacian heterogeneous graph attention network (HL-HGAT), designed to learn heterogeneous signal representations across $k$-simplices. The HL-HGAT incorporates three key components: HL convolutional filters (HL-filters), simplicial projection (SP), and simplicial attention pooling (SAP) operators, applied to $k$-simplices. HL-filters leverage the unique topology of $k$-simplices encoded by the Hodge-Laplacian (HL) operator, operating within the spectral domain of the $k$-th HL operator. To address computation challenges, we introduce a polynomial approximation for HL-filters, exhibiting spatial localization properties. Additionally, we propose a pooling operator to coarsen $k$-simplices, combining features through simplicial attention mechanisms of self-attention and cross-attention via transformers and SP operators, capturing topological interconnections across multiple dimensions of simplices. The HL-HGAT is comprehensively evaluated across diverse graph applications, including NP-hard problems, graph multi-label and classification challenges, and graph regression tasks in logistics, computer vision, biology, chemistry, and neuroscience. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy and versatility in handling a wide range of graph-based scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Graph Neural Networks to Predict Local Culture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17905v3)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

We analyse itsstability leveraging contraction analysis and propose a closed-form model that preserves the model contraction rate and doesnot require solving an ODE at each iteration. Compared todiscrete models like Graph Gated Neural Networks (GGNNs),the higher expressivity of the proposed model guaranteesremarkable performance while reducing the large amountof communicated variables normally required by GNNs. Weevaluate our model on a distributed multi-agent control casestudy (flocking) taking into account variable communicationrange and scalability under non-instantaneous communication</p></details> |  |
| **[Operational risk quantification of power grids using graph neural network surrogates of the DC OPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03661v2)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A DC OPF surrogate modeling framework is developed for Monte Carlo (MC) sampling-based risk quantification in power grid operation. MC simulation necessitates solving a large number of DC OPF problems corresponding to the samples of stochastic grid variables (power demand and renewable generation), which is computationally prohibitive. Computationally inexpensive surrogates of OPF provide an attractive alternative for expedited MC simulation. Graph neural network (GNN) surrogates of DC OPF, which are especially suitable to graph-structured data, are employed in this work. Previously developed DC OPF surrogate models have focused on accurate operational decision-making and not on risk quantification. Here, risk quantification-specific aspects of DC OPF surrogate evaluation is the main focus. To this end, the proposed GNN surrogates are evaluated using realistic joint probability distributions, quantification of their risk estimation accuracy, and investigation of their generalizability. Four synthetic grids (Case118, Case300, Case1354pegase, and Case2848rte) are used for surrogate model performance evaluation. It is shown that the GNN surrogates are sufficiently accurate for predicting the (bus-level, branch-level and system-level) grid state and enable fast as well as accurate operational risk quantification for power grids. The article thus develops tools for fast reliability and risk quantification in real-world power grids using GNN-based surrogates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modelingpapers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Social Bot Detection via Structural Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13595v1)** | 2024-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on social bot detection plays a crucial role in maintaining the order and reliability of information dissemination while increasing trust in social interactions. The current mainstream social bot detection models rely on black-box neural network technology, e.g., Graph Neural Network, Transformer, etc., which lacks interpretability. In this work, we present UnDBot, a novel unsupervised, interpretable, yet effective and practical framework for detecting social bots. This framework is built upon structural information theory. We begin by designing three social relationship metrics that capture various aspects of social bot behaviors: Posting Type Distribution, Posting Influence, and Follow-to-follower Ratio. Three new relationships are utilized to construct a new, unified, and weighted social multi-relational graph, aiming to model the relevance of social user behaviors and discover long-distance correlations between users. Second, we introduce a novel method for optimizing heterogeneous structural entropy. This method involves the personalized aggregation of edge information from the social multi-relational graph to generate a two-dimensional encoding tree. The heterogeneous structural entropy facilitates decoding of the substantial structure of the social bots network and enables hierarchical clustering of social bots. Thirdly, a new community labeling method is presented to distinguish social bot communities by computing the user's stationary distribution, measuring user contributions to network structure, and counting the intensity of user aggregation within the community. Compared with ten representative social bot detection approaches, comprehensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of effectiveness and interpretability of UnDBot on four real social network datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Transactions on Information Systems</p></details> |

However, the distribution shift between the training and test data challenges the effectiveness of GNNs. To mitigate this challenge, Test-Time Training (TTT) has been proposed as a promising approach. Traditional TTT methods require a demanding unsupervised training strategy to capture the information from test to benefit the main task. Inspired by the great annotation ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), we propose to enhance the test-time training on graphs with LLMs as annotators. In this paper, we design a novel Test-Time Training pipeline, LLMTTT, which conducts the test-time adaptation under the annotations by LLMs on a carefully-selected node set. Specifically, LLMTTT introduces a hybrid active node selection strategy that considers not only node diversity and representativeness, but also prediction signals from the pre-trained model. Given annotations from LLMs, a two-stage training strategy is designed to tailor the test-time model with the limited and noisy labels. A theoretical analysis ensures the validity of our method and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLMTTT can achieve a significant performance improvement compared to existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization methods.</p></details> |  |

They do not encapsulate both semantic and visuo-spatial relationships among elements. To seize machine learning's potential for GUIs more efficiently, Graph4GUI exploits graph neural networks to capture individual elements' properties and their semantic-visuo-spatial constraints in a layout. The learned representation demonstrated its effectiveness in multiple tasks, especially generating designs in a challenging GUI autocompletion task, which involved predicting the positions of remaining unplaced elements in a partially completed GUI. The new model's suggestions showed alignment and visual appeal superior to the baseline method and received higher subjective ratings for preference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical benefits and efficiency advantages designers perceive when utilizing our model as an autocompletion plug-in.</p></details> | 18 pages |

It is mainly caused by the exponential growth of node dependency with the increase of layers. It extremely limits the application of stochastic optimization algorithms so that the training of GNN is usually time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose to decouple a multi-layer GNN as multiple simple modules for more efficient training, which is comprised of classical forward training (FT)and designed backward training (BT). Under the proposed framework, each module can be trained efficiently in FT by stochastic algorithms without distortion of graph information owing to its simplicity. To avoid the only unidirectional information delivery of FT and sufficiently train shallow modules with the deeper ones, we develop a backward training mechanism that makes the former modules perceive the latter modules. The backward training introduces the reversed information delivery into the decoupled modules as well as the forward information delivery. To investigate how the decoupling and greedy training affect the representational capacity, we theoretically prove that the error produced by linear modules will not accumulate on unsupervised tasks in most cases. The theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed framework is highly efficient with reasonable performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Traditional methods relying on RGB images are resource-intensive, whereas our approach with Facial Landmark Emotion Recognition (FLER) offers a simplified yet effective alternative. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze the geometric and spatial relationships of facial landmarks, our method enhances the understanding and accuracy of emotion recognition. We discuss the advancements and challenges in deep learning techniques for emotion recognition, particularly focusing on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers.

| **[Hierarchical Representation Learning in Graph Neural Networks with Node Decimation Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11436v3)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In graph neural networks (GNNs), pooling operators compute local summaries of input graphs to capture their global properties, and they are fundamental for building deep GNNs that learn hierarchical representations. In this work, we propose the Node Decimation Pooling (NDP), a pooling operator for GNNs that generates coarser graphs while preserving the overall graph topology. During training, the GNN learns new node representations and fits them to a pyramid of coarsened graphs, which is computed offline in a pre-processing stage. NDP consists of three steps. First, a node decimation procedure selects the nodes belonging to one side of the partition identified by a spectral algorithm that approximates the \maxcut{} solution. Afterwards, the selected nodes are connected with Kron reduction to form the coarsened graph. Finally, since the resulting graph is very dense, we apply a sparsification procedure that prunes the adjacency matrix of the coarsened graph to reduce the computational cost in the GNN. Notably, we show that it is possible to remove many edges without significantly altering the graph structure. Experimental results show that NDP is more efficient compared to state-of-the-art graph pooling operators while reaching, at the same time, competitive performance on a significant variety of graph classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRANOLA: Adaptive Normalization for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13344v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, significant efforts have been made to refine the design of Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers, aiming to overcome diverse challenges, such as limited expressive power and oversmoothing. Despite their widespread adoption, the incorporation of off-the-shelf normalization layers like BatchNorm or InstanceNorm within a GNN architecture may not effectively capture the unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially reducing the expressive power of the overall architecture. Moreover, existing graph-specific normalization layers often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits. In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its neighborhood structure, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We present theoretical results that support our design choices. Our extensive empirical evaluation of various graph benchmarks underscores the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques. Furthermore, GRANOLA emerges as the top-performing method among all baselines within the same time complexity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs).</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods formulate the task as a multi-classification problem, i.e. assigning predefined labels to proteins. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Prot2Text, which predicts a protein's function in a free text style, moving beyond the conventional binary or categorical classifications. By combining Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) and Large Language Models(LLMs), in an encoder-decoder framework, our model effectively integrates diverse data types including protein sequence, structure, and textual annotation and description. This multimodal approach allows for a holistic representation of proteins' functions, enabling the generation of detailed and accurate functional descriptions. To evaluate our model, we extracted a multimodal protein dataset from SwissProt, and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of Prot2Text. These results highlight the transformative impact of multimodal models, specifically the fusion of GNNs and LLMs, empowering researchers with powerful tools for more accurate function prediction of existing as well as first-to-see proteins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08945v2)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data in tabular format is frequently occurring in real-world applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time, the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional computational overhead.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[MultiModal-Learning for Predicting Molecular Properties: A Framework Based on Image and Graph Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16666v2)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for accurate prediction of drug molecule properties poses a fundamental challenge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery (AIDD). An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Although recent studies on graph neural networks (GNNs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) have exhibited their power in encoding network and text signals, respectively, less attention has been paid to delicately coupling these two types of models on TAGs. Specifically, existing GNNs rarely model text in each node in a contextualized way; existing PLMs can hardly be applied to characterize graph structures due to their sequence architecture. To address these challenges, we propose HASH-CODE, a High-frequency Aware Spectral Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding method that integrates GNNs and PLMs into a unified model. Different from previous "cascaded architectures" that directly add GNN layers upon a PLM, our HASH-CODE relies on five self-supervised optimization objectives to facilitate thorough mutual enhancement between network and text signals in diverse granularities. Moreover, we show that existing contrastive objective learns the low-frequency component of the augmentation graph and propose a high-frequency component (HFC)-aware contrastive learning objective that makes the learned embeddings more distinctive. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach. In addition, theoretical analysis and item embedding visualization provide insights into our model interoperability.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2024 |

Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency. Results: This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods. Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\% (top-5) and 5.4\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Matrix-Based Sampling for Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02909v3)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compact and computationally efficient way to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. GNN models are frequently large, making distributed minibatch training necessary. The primary contribution of this paper is new methods for reducing communication in the sampling step for distributed GNN training. Here, we propose a matrix-based bulk sampling approach that expresses sampling as a sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) and samples multiple minibatches at once. When the input graph topology does not fit on a single device, our method distributes the graph and use communication-avoiding SpGEMM algorithms to scale GNN minibatch sampling, enabling GNN training on much larger graphs than those that can fit into a single device memory. When the input graph topology (but not the embeddings) fits in the memory of one GPU, our approach (1) performs sampling without communication, (2) amortizes the overheads of sampling a minibatch, and (3) can represent multiple sampling algorithms by simply using different matrix constructions. In addition to new methods for sampling, we introduce a pipeline that uses our matrix-based bulk sampling approach to provide end-to-end training results. We provide experimental results on the largest Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets on $128$ GPUs, and show that our pipeline is $2.5\times$ faster than Quiver (a distributed extension to PyTorch-Geometric) on a $3$-layer GraphSAGE network. On datasets outside of OGB, we show a $8.46\times$ speedup on $128$ GPUs in per-epoch time. Finally, we show scaling when the graph is distributed across GPUs and scaling for both node-wise and layer-wise sampling algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of Machine Learning and Systems</p></details> |

Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in PSRO to improve scalability in solving large-scale PEGs. However, these methods primarily focus on specific PEGs with fixed initial conditions that may vary substantially in real-world scenarios, which significantly hinders the applicability of the traditional methods. To address this issue, we introduce Grasper, a GeneRAlist purSuer for Pursuit-Evasion pRoblems, capable of efficiently generating pursuer policies tailored to specific PEGs. Our contributions are threefold: First, we present a novel architecture that offers high-quality solutions for diverse PEGs, comprising critical components such as (i) a graph neural network (GNN) to encode PEGs into hidden vectors, and (ii) a hypernetwork to generate pursuer policies based on these hidden vectors. As a second contribution, we develop an efficient three-stage training method involving (i) a pre-pretraining stage for learning robust PEG representations through self-supervised graph learning techniques like GraphMAE, (ii) a pre-training stage utilizing heuristic-guided multi-task pre-training (HMP) where heuristic-derived reference policies (e.g., through Dijkstra's algorithm) regularize pursuer policies, and (iii) a fine-tuning stage that employs PSRO to generate pursuer policies on designated PEGs. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world maps, showcasing Grasper's significant superiority over baselines in terms of solution quality and generalizability. We demonstrate that Grasper provides a versatile approach for solving pursuit-evasion problems across a broad range of scenarios, enabling practical deployment in real-world situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Infinite-Horizon Graph Filters: Leveraging Power Series to Enhance Sparse Information Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09943v3)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown considerable effectiveness in a variety of graph learning tasks, particularly those based on the message-passing approach in recent years. However, their performance is often constrained by a limited receptive field, a challenge that becomes more acute in the presence of sparse graphs. In light of the power series, which possesses infinite expansion capabilities, we propose a novel Graph Power Filter Neural Network (GPFN) that enhances node classification by employing a power series graph filter to augment the receptive field. Concretely, our GPFN designs a new way to build a graph filter with an infinite receptive field based on the convergence power series, which can be analyzed in the spectral and spatial domains. Besides, we theoretically prove that our GPFN is a general framework that can integrate any power series and capture long-range dependencies. Finally, experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GPFN over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[Multi-View Subgraph Neural Networks: Self-Supervised Learning with Scarce Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12569v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks. Experimental results show that Muse outperforms the alternative methods on node classification tasks with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the interpretability of GNN predictions through conformal-based graph sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12356v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving graph classification tasks. However, most GNN architectures aggregate information from all nodes and edges in a graph, regardless of their relevance to the task at hand, thus hindering the interpretability of their predictions. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose a GNN \emph{training} approach that jointly i) finds the most predictive subgraph by removing edges and/or nodes -- -\emph{without making assumptions about the subgraph structure} -- while ii) optimizing the performance of the graph classification task. To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier. Our empirical results on nine different graph classification datasets show that our method competes in performance with baselines while relying on significantly sparser subgraphs, leading to more interpretable GNN-based predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Edits for Counterfactual Explanations: A comparative study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11609v3)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactuals have been established as a popular explainability technique which leverages a set of minimal edits to alter the prediction of a classifier. When considering conceptual counterfactuals on images, the edits requested should correspond to salient concepts present in the input data. At the same time, conceptual distances are defined by knowledge graphs, ensuring the optimality of conceptual edits. In this work, we extend previous endeavors on graph edits as counterfactual explanations by conducting a comparative study which encompasses both supervised and unsupervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches. To this end, we pose the following significant research question: should we represent input data as graphs, which is the optimal GNN approach in terms of performance and time efficiency to generate minimal and meaningful counterfactual explanations for black-box image classifiers?</p></details> |  |
| **[Label Inference Attacks against Node-level Vertical Federated GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02465v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models by keeping the raw data of the involved workers private. Three of its main objectives are to improve the models' privacy, security, and scalability. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers an efficient cross-silo setting where a few parties collaboratively train a model without sharing the same features. In such a scenario, classification labels are commonly considered sensitive information held exclusively by one (active) party, while other (passive) parties use only their local information. Recent works have uncovered important flaws of VFL, leading to possible label inference attacks under the assumption that the attacker has some, even limited, background knowledge on the relation between labels and data. In this work, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to investigate label inference attacks on VFL using a zero-background knowledge strategy. To formulate our proposal, we focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a target model for the underlying VFL. In particular, we refer to node classification tasks, which are widely studied, and GNNs have shown promising results. Our proposed attack, BlindSage, provides impressive results in the experiments, achieving nearly 100% accuracy in most cases. Even when the attacker has no information about the used architecture or the number of classes, the accuracy remains above 90% in most instances. Finally, we observe that well-known defenses cannot mitigate our attack without affecting the model's performance on the main classification task.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Scalability of GNNs for Molecular Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11568v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning models has been at the heart of recent revolutions in language modelling and image generation. Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets, resulting in a 30.25% improvement when scaling to 1 billion parameters and 28.98% improvement when increasing size of dataset to eightfold. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 tasks, outclassing previous large models. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Factorisation for Polypharmacy Side Effect Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11374v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse reactions caused by drug combinations are an increasingly common phenomenon, making their accurate prediction an important challenge in modern medicine. However, the polynomial nature of this problem renders lab-based identification of adverse reactions insufficient. Dozens of computational approaches have therefore been proposed for the task in recent years, with varying degrees of success. One group of methods that has seemingly been under-utilised in this area is tensor factorisation, despite their clear applicability to this type of data. In this work, we apply three such models to a benchmark dataset in order to compare them against established techniques. We find, in contrast to previous reports, that for this task tensor factorisation models are competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network models and we recommend that future work in this field considers cheaper methods with linear complexity before running costly deep learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG_GLT-Net: Optimising EEG Graphs for Real-time Motor Imagery Signals Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11075v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-Computer Interfaces connect the brain to external control devices, necessitating the accurate translation of brain signals such as from electroencephalography (EEG) into executable commands. Graph Neural Networks (GCN) have been increasingly applied for classifying EEG Motor Imagery signals, primarily because they incorporates the spatial relationships among EEG channels, resulting in improved accuracy over traditional convolutional methods. Recent advances by GCNs-Net in real-time EEG MI signal classification utilised Pearson Coefficient Correlation (PCC) for constructing adjacency matrices, yielding significant results on the PhysioNet dataset. Our paper introduces the EEG Graph Lottery Ticket (EEG_GLT) algorithm, an innovative technique for constructing adjacency matrices for EEG channels. It does not require pre-existing knowledge of inter-channel relationships, and it can be tailored to suit both individual subjects and GCN model architectures. Our findings demonstrated that the PCC method outperformed the Geodesic approach by 9.65% in mean accuracy, while our EEG_GLT matrix consistently exceeded the performance of the PCC method by a mean accuracy of 13.39%. Also, we found that the construction of the adjacency matrix significantly influenced accuracy, to a greater extent than GCN model configurations. A basic GCN configuration utilising our EEG_GLT matrix exceeded the performance of even the most complex GCN setup with a PCC matrix in average accuracy. Our EEG_GLT method also reduced MACs by up to 97% compared to the PCC method, while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. In conclusion, the EEG_GLT algorithm marks a breakthrough in the development of optimal adjacency matrices, effectively boosting both computational accuracy and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time classification of EEG MI signals that demand intensive computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[You do not have to train Graph Neural Networks at all on text-attributed graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11019v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph structured data, specifically text-attributed graphs (TAG), effectively represent relationships among varied entities. Such graphs are essential for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for handling this graph-structured data. Although gradient descent is commonly utilized for training GNNs for node classification, this study ventures into alternative methods, eliminating the iterative optimization processes. We introduce TrainlessGNN, a linear GNN model capitalizing on the observation that text encodings from the same class often cluster together in a linear subspace. This model constructs a weight matrix to represent each class's node attribute subspace, offering an efficient approach to semi-supervised node classification on TAG. Extensive experiments reveal that our trainless models can either match or even surpass their conventionally trained counterparts, demonstrating the possibility of refraining from gradient descent in certain configurations.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Graph Continual Learning with Debiased Lossless Memory Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10984v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life graph data often expands continually, rendering the learning of graph neural networks (GNNs) on static graph data impractical. Graph continual learning (GCL) tackles this problem by continually adapting GNNs to the expanded graph of the current task while maintaining the performance over the graph of previous tasks. Memory replay-based methods, which aim to replay data of previous tasks when learning new tasks, have been explored as one principled approach to mitigate the forgetting of the knowledge learned from the previous tasks. In this paper we extend this methodology with a novel framework, called Debiased Lossless Memory replay (DeLoMe). Unlike existing methods that sample nodes/edges of previous graphs to construct the memory, DeLoMe learns small lossless synthetic node representations as the memory. The learned memory can not only preserve the graph data privacy but also capture the holistic graph information, for which the sampling-based methods are not viable. Further, prior methods suffer from bias toward the current task due to the data imbalance between the classes in the memory data and the current data. A debiased GCL loss function is devised in DeLoMe to effectively alleviate this bias. Extensive experiments on four graph datasets show the effectiveness of DeLoMe under both class- and task-incremental learning settings.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Advances in jet tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in high-energy physics experiments.

Recent developments in Object-Centric Process Mining have enriched event data with objects and their explicit relations between events. To leverage this enriched data, we propose the Heterogeneous Object Event Graph encoding (HOEG), which integrates events and objects into a graph structure with diverse node types. It does so without aggregating object features, thus creating a more nuanced and informative representation. We then adopt a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network architecture, which incorporates these diverse object features in prediction tasks. We evaluate the performance and scalability of HOEG in predicting remaining time, benchmarking it against two established graph-based encodings and two baseline models. Our evaluation uses three Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs), including one from a real-life process at a major Dutch financial institution. The results indicate that HOEG competes well with existing models and surpasses them when OCELs contain informative object attributes and event-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to 36th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAISE), 2024</p></details> |

Numerous strategies have been proposed for predicting PPIs, and among them, graph-based methods have demonstrated promising outcomes owing to the inherent graph structure of PPI networks. This paper reviews various graph-based methodologies, and discusses their applications in PPI prediction. We classify these approaches into two primary groups based on their model structures. The first category employs Graph Neural Networks (GNN) or Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), while the second category utilizes Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Auto-Encoders and Graph-BERT. We highlight the distinctive methodologies of each approach in managing the graph-structured data inherent in PPI networks and anticipate future research directions in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGHINT: Attribute-Guided Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Information Networks with Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10443v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved impressive success in representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies and heterogeneity at the node level. However, few existing studies have delved into the utilization of node attributes in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). In this paper, we investigate the impact of inter-node attribute disparities on HGNNs performance within the benchmark task, i.e., node classification, and empirically find that typical models exhibit significant performance decline when classifying nodes whose attributes markedly differ from their neighbors. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Attribute-Guided heterogeneous Information Networks representation learning model with Transformer (AGHINT), which allows a more effective aggregation of neighbor node information under the guidance of attributes. Specifically, AGHINT transcends the constraints of the original graph structure by directly integrating higher-order similar neighbor features into the learning process and modifies the message-passing mechanism between nodes based on their attribute disparities. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graph benchmarks with target node attributes demonstrate that AGHINT outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Proposing an intelligent mesh smoothing method with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12815v2)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In CFD, mesh smoothing methods are commonly utilized to refine the mesh quality to achieve high-precision numerical simulations. Specifically, optimization-based smoothing is used for high-quality mesh smoothing, but it incurs significant computational overhead. Pioneer works improve its smoothing efficiency by adopting supervised learning to learn smoothing methods from high-quality meshes. However, they pose difficulty in smoothing the mesh nodes with varying degrees and also need data augmentation to address the node input sequence problem. Additionally, the required labeled high-quality meshes further limit the applicability of the proposed method. In this paper, we present GMSNet, a lightweight neural network model for intelligent mesh smoothing. GMSNet adopts graph neural networks to extract features of the node's neighbors and output the optimal node position. During smoothing, we also introduce a fault-tolerance mechanism to prevent GMSNet from generating negative volume elements. With a lightweight model, GMSNet can effectively smoothing mesh nodes with varying degrees and remain unaffected by the order of input data. A novel loss function, MetricLoss, is also developed to eliminate the need for high-quality meshes, which provides a stable and rapid convergence during training. We compare GMSNet with commonly used mesh smoothing methods on two-dimensional triangle meshes. The experimental results show that GMSNet achieves outstanding mesh smoothing performances with 5% model parameters of the previous model, and attains 13.56 times faster than optimization-based smoothing.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD) is the scarcity of high-quality data, which often requires extensive wet-lab work. A typical example of this is pharmacokinetic experiments. In this work, we develop a physical formula enhanced mul-ti-task learning (PEMAL) method that predicts four key parameters of pharmacokinetics simultaneously. By incorporating physical formulas into the multi-task framework, PEMAL facilitates effective knowledge sharing and target alignment among the pharmacokinetic parameters, thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction. Our experiments reveal that PEMAL significantly lowers the data demand, compared to typical Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that PEMAL enhances the robustness to noise, an advantage that conventional Neural Networks do not possess. Another advantage of PEMAL is its high flexibility, which can be potentially applied to other multi-task machine learning scenarios. Overall, our work illustrates the benefits and potential of using PEMAL in AIDD and other scenarios with data scarcity and noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Graph Polynomial Filter via Positive and Negative Coupling Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10353v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the optimization of polynomial filters within Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has emerged as a prominent research focus. Existing spectral GNNs mainly emphasize polynomial properties in filter design, introducing computational overhead and neglecting the integration of crucial graph structure information. We argue that incorporating graph information into basis construction can enhance understanding of polynomial basis, and further facilitate simplified polynomial filter design. Motivated by this, we first propose a Positive and Negative Coupling Analysis (PNCA) framework, where the concepts of positive and negative activation are defined and their respective and mixed effects are analysed. Then, we explore PNCA from the message propagation perspective, revealing the subtle information hidden in the activation process. Subsequently, PNCA is used to analyze the mainstream polynomial filters, and a novel simple basis that decouples the positive and negative activation and fully utilizes graph structure information is designed. Finally, a simple GNN (called GSCNet) is proposed based on the new basis. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets for node classification verify that our GSCNet obtains better or comparable results compared with existing state-of-the-art GNNs while demanding relatively less computational time.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
