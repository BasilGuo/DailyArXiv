| **[Time Series Compression using Quaternion Valued Neural Networks and   Quaternion Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11722v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel quaternionic time-series compression methodology where we divide a long time-series into segments of data, extract the min, max, mean and standard deviation of these chunks as representative features and encapsulate them in a quaternion, yielding a quaternion valued time-series. This time-series is processed using quaternion valued neural network layers, where we aim to preserve the relation between these features through the usage of the Hamilton product. To train this quaternion neural network, we derive quaternion backpropagation employing the GHR calculus, which is required for a valid product and chain rule in quaternion space. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between the derived update rules and automatic differentiation. We apply our proposed compression method on the Tennessee Eastman Dataset, where we perform fault classification using the compressed data in two settings: a fully supervised one and in a semi supervised, contrastive learning setting. Both times, we were able to outperform real valued counterparts as well as two baseline models: one with the uncompressed time-series as the input and the other with a regular downsampling using the mean. Further, we could improve the classification benchmark set by SimCLR-TS from 81.43% to 83.90%.</p></details> |  |
| **[QEAN: Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network for Visual Dance Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11626v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of music-generated dance is a novel and challenging Image generation task. It aims to input a piece of music and seed motions, then generate natural dance movements for the subsequent music. Transformer-based methods face challenges in time series prediction tasks related to human movements and music due to their struggle in capturing the nonlinear relationship and temporal aspects. This can lead to issues like joint deformation, role deviation, floating, and inconsistencies in dance movements generated in response to the music. In this paper, we propose a Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network (QEAN) for visual dance synthesis from a quaternion perspective, which consists of a Spin Position Embedding (SPE) module and a Quaternion Rotary Attention (QRA) module. First, SPE embeds position information into self-attention in a rotational manner, leading to better learning of features of movement sequences and audio sequences, and improved understanding of the connection between music and dance. Second, QRA represents and fuses 3D motion features and audio features in the form of a series of quaternions, enabling the model to better learn the temporal coordination of music and dance under the complex temporal cycle conditions of dance generation. Finally, we conducted experiments on the dataset AIST++, and the results show that our approach achieves better and more robust performance in generating accurate, high-quality dance movements. Our source code and dataset can be available from https://github.com/MarasyZZ/QEAN and https://google.github.io/aistplusplus_dataset respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Visual Computer Journal</p></details> |
| **[UniRepLKNet: A Universal Perception Large-Kernel ConvNet for Audio,   Video, Point Cloud, Time-Series and Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15599v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-kernel convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have recently received extensive research attention, but two unresolved and critical issues demand further investigation. 1) The architectures of existing large-kernel ConvNets largely follow the design principles of conventional ConvNets or transformers, while the architectural design for large-kernel ConvNets remains under-addressed. 2) As transformers have dominated multiple modalities, it remains to be investigated whether ConvNets also have a strong universal perception ability in domains beyond vision. In this paper, we contribute from two aspects. 1) We propose four architectural guidelines for designing large-kernel ConvNets, the core of which is to exploit the essential characteristics of large kernels that distinguish them from small kernels - they can see wide without going deep. Following such guidelines, our proposed large-kernel ConvNet shows leading performance in image recognition (ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and COCO box AP of 56.4%), demonstrating better performance and higher speed than the recent powerful competitors. 2) We discover large kernels are the key to unlocking the exceptional performance of ConvNets in domains where they were originally not proficient. With certain modality-related preprocessing approaches, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-series forecasting and audio recognition tasks even without modality-specific customization to the architecture. All the code and models are publicly available on GitHub and Huggingface.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

| **[Towards understanding the nature of direct functional connectivity in   visual brain network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11480v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neuroimaging have enabled studies in functional connectivity (FC) of human brain, alongside investigation of the neuronal basis of cognition. One important FC study is the representation of vision in human brain. The release of publicly available dataset BOLD5000 has made it possible to study the brain dynamics during visual tasks in greater detail. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of fMRI time series (TS) has been performed to explore different types of visual brain networks (VBN). The novelty of this work lies in (1) constructing VBN with consistently significant direct connectivity using both marginal and partial correlation, which is further analyzed using graph theoretic measures, (2) classification of VBNs as formed by image complexity-specific TS, using graphical features. In image complexity-specific VBN classification, XGBoost yields average accuracy in the range of 86.5% to 91.5% for positively correlated VBN, which is 2% greater than that using negative correlation. This result not only reflects the distinguishing graphical characteristics of each image complexity-specific VBN, but also highlights the importance of studying both positively correlated and negatively correlated VBN to understand the how differently brain functions while viewing different complexities of real-world images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Weaver: semi-synthetic time-varying traffic generator based on   averaged time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11388v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Weaver is a Python package developed to generate a semi-synthetic signal (time series) with finer granularity, based on averaged time series, in a manner that, upon averaging, closely matches the original signal provided. The key components utilized to recreate the signal encompass oversampling with a given strategy, stretching to match the integral of the original time series, smoothing, repeating, applying trend, and adding noise. The primary motivation behind Traffic Weaver is to furnish semi-synthetic time-varying traffic in telecommunication networks, facilitating the development and validation of traffic prediction models, as well as aiding in the deployment of network optimization algorithms tailored for time-varying traffic.</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Bandwidth Efficiency for Video Motion Transfer Applications   using Deep Learning Based Keypoint Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11337v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep learning based novel prediction framework for enhanced bandwidth reduction in motion transfer enabled video applications such as video conferencing, virtual reality gaming and privacy preservation for patient health monitoring. To model complex motion, we use the First Order Motion Model (FOMM) that represents dynamic objects using learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. Keypoints are extracted by a self-supervised keypoint detector and organized in a time series corresponding to the video frames. Prediction of keypoints, to enable transmission using lower frames per second on the source device, is performed using a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN). The predicted keypoints are then synthesized to video frames using an optical flow estimator and a generator network. This efficacy of leveraging keypoint based representations in conjunction with VRNN based prediction for both video animation and reconstruction is demonstrated on three diverse datasets. For real-time applications, our results show the effectiveness of our proposed architecture by enabling up to 2x additional bandwidth reduction over existing keypoint based video motion transfer frameworks without significantly compromising video quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Jumping of a Parallel Wire-Driven Monopedal Robot RAMIEL   Using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11205v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have developed a parallel wire-driven monopedal robot, RAMIEL, which has both speed and power due to the parallel wire mechanism and a long acceleration distance. RAMIEL is capable of jumping high and continuously, and so has high performance in traveling. On the other hand, one of the drawbacks of a minimal parallel wire-driven robot without joint encoders is that the current joint velocities estimated from the wire lengths oscillate due to the elongation of the wires, making the values unreliable. Therefore, despite its high performance, the control of the robot is unstable, and in 10 out of 16 jumps, the robot could only jump up to two times continuously. In this study, we propose a method to realize a continuous jumping motion by reinforcement learning in simulation, and its application to the actual robot. Because the joint velocities oscillate with the elongation of the wires, they are not used directly, but instead are inferred from the time series of joint angles. At the same time, noise that imitates the vibration caused by the elongation of the wires is added for transfer to the actual robot. The results show that the system can be applied to the actual robot RAMIEL as well as to the stable continuous jumping motion in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Humanoids2022</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11144v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of time series forecasting (TSF), the Transformer has consistently demonstrated robust performance due to its ability to focus on the global context and effectively capture long-range dependencies within time, as well as discern correlations between multiple variables. However, due to the inefficiencies of the Transformer model and questions surrounding its ability to capture dependencies, ongoing efforts to refine the Transformer architecture persist. Recently, state space models (SSMs), e.g. Mamba, have gained traction due to their ability to capture complex dependencies in sequences, similar to the Transformer, while maintaining near-linear complexity. In text and image tasks, Mamba-based models can improve performance and cost savings, creating a win-win situation. This has piqued our interest in exploring SSM's potential in TSF tasks. In this paper, we introduce two straightforward SSM-based models for TSF, S-Mamba and D-Mamba, both employing the Mamba Block to extract variate correlations. Remarkably, S-Mamba and D-Mamba achieve superior performance while saving GPU memory and training time. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into the potential of Mamba compared to the Transformer in the TSF, aiming to explore a new research direction for this field. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzhwzhwzh0921/S-D-Mamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Pixels to Predictions: Spectrogram and Vision Transformer for   Better Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11047v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making across various domains, but it presents significant challenges. Recent studies have explored image-driven approaches using computer vision models to address these challenges, often employing lineplots as the visual representation of time series data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses time-frequency spectrograms as the visual representation of time series data. We introduce the use of a vision transformer for multimodal learning, showcasing the advantages of our approach across diverse datasets from different domains. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare our method against statistical baselines (EMA and ARIMA), a state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach (DeepAR), other visual representations of time series data (lineplot images), and an ablation study on using only the time series as input. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of utilizing spectrograms as a visual representation for time series data, along with the advantages of employing a vision transformer for simultaneous learning in both the time and frequency domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM ICAIF 2023</p></details> |
| **[Advancing multivariate time series similarity assessment: an integrated   computational approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11044v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data mining, particularly the analysis of multivariate time series data, plays a crucial role in extracting insights from complex systems and supporting informed decision-making across diverse domains. However, assessing the similarity of multivariate time series data presents several challenges, including dealing with large datasets, addressing temporal misalignments, and the need for efficient and comprehensive analytical frameworks. To address all these challenges, we propose a novel integrated computational approach known as Multivariate Time series Alignment and Similarity Assessment (MTASA). MTASA is built upon a hybrid methodology designed to optimize time series alignment, complemented by a multiprocessing engine that enhances the utilization of computational resources. This integrated approach comprises four key components, each addressing essential aspects of time series similarity assessment, thereby offering a comprehensive framework for analysis. MTASA is implemented as an open-source Python library with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to researchers and practitioners. To evaluate the effectiveness of MTASA, we conducted an empirical study focused on assessing agroecosystem similarity using real-world environmental data. The results from this study highlight MTASA's superiority, achieving approximately 1.5 times greater accuracy and twice the speed compared to existing state-of-the-art integrated frameworks for multivariate time series similarity assessment. It is hoped that MTASA will significantly enhance the efficiency and accessibility of multivariate time series analysis, benefitting researchers and practitioners across various domains. Its capabilities in handling large datasets, addressing temporal misalignments, and delivering accurate results make MTASA a valuable tool for deriving insights and aiding decision-making processes in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis and Fully Memristor-based Reservoir Computing for Temporal Data   Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01827v2)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing (RC) offers a neuromorphic framework that is particularly effective for processing spatiotemporal signals. Known for its temporal processing prowess, RC significantly lowers training costs compared to conventional recurrent neural networks. A key component in its hardware deployment is the ability to generate dynamic reservoir states. Our research introduces a novel dual-memory RC system, integrating a short-term memory via a WOx-based memristor, capable of achieving 16 distinct states encoded over 4 bits, and a long-term memory component using a TiOx-based memristor within the readout layer. We thoroughly examine both memristor types and leverage the RC system to process temporal data sets. The performance of the proposed RC system is validated through two benchmark tasks: isolated spoken digit recognition with incomplete inputs and Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The system delivered an impressive 98.84% accuracy in digit recognition and sustained a low normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.036 in the time series prediction task, underscoring its capability. This study illuminates the adeptness of memristor-based RC systems in managing intricate temporal challenges, laying the groundwork for further innovations in neuromorphic computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 20 figures, Journal, Typo corrected and updated reference</p></details> |
| **[REBAR: Retrieval-Based Reconstruction for Time-series Contrastive   Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00519v3)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of self-supervised contrastive learning hinges on identifying positive data pairs, such that when they are pushed together in embedding space, the space encodes useful information for subsequent downstream tasks. Constructing positive pairs is non-trivial as the pairing must be similar enough to reflect a shared semantic meaning, but different enough to capture within-class variation. Classical approaches in vision use augmentations to exploit well-established invariances to construct positive pairs, but invariances in the time-series domain are much less obvious. In our work, we propose a novel method of using a learned measure for identifying positive pairs. Our Retrieval-Based Reconstruction (REBAR) measure measures the similarity between two sequences as the reconstruction error that results from reconstructing one sequence with retrieved information from the other. Then, if the two sequences have high REBAR similarity, we label them as a positive pair. Through validation experiments, we show that the REBAR error is a predictor of mutual class membership. Once integrated into a contrastive learning framework, our REBAR method learns an embedding that achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks across various modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 | Code available at: https://github.com/maxxu05/rebar</p></details> |
| **[Learning Inertial Parameter Identification of Unknown Object with   Humanoid Robot using Real-to-Sim Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09810v2)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fast learning-based inertial parameters estimation framework capable of understanding the dynamics of an unknown object to enable a humanoid (or manipulator) to more safely and accurately interact with its surrounding environments. Unlike most relevant literature, our framework doesn't require to use of a force/torque sensor, vision system, and a long-horizon trajectory. To achieve fast inertia parameter estimation, a time-series data-driven regression model is utilized rather than solving a constrained optimization problem. Due to the challenge of obtaining a large number of the ground truth of inertia parameters in the real world, we acquire a reliable dataset in a high-fidelity simulation that is developed using a real-to-sim adaptation. The adaptation method we introduced consists of two components: 1) \textit{Robot System Identification} and 2) \textit{Gaussian Processes}. We demonstrate our method with a 4-DOF single manipulator of a wheeled humanoid robot, SATYRR. Results show that our method can identify the inertial parameters of various unknown objects quickly while maintaining sufficient accuracy compared to other methods. Manipulation and locomotion experiments were also carried out to show the benefit of using the estimated inertia parameters from control perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Inflated Stochastic Volatility Model for Disaggregated Inflation   Data with Exact Zeros](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10945v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The disaggregated time-series data for Consumer Price Index often exhibits frequent instances of exact zero price changes, stemming from measurement errors inherent in the data collection process. However, the currently prominent stochastic volatility model of trend inflation is designed for aggregate measures of price inflation, where exact zero price changes rarely occur. We propose a zero-inflated stochastic volatility model applicable to such nonstationary real-valued multivariate time-series data with exact zeros, by a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model that jointly specifies the dynamic zero-generating process. We also provide an efficient custom Gibbs sampler that leverages the P\'olya-Gamma augmentation. Applying the model to disaggregated Japanese Consumer Price Index data, we find that the zero-inflated model provides more sensible and informative estimates of time-varying trend and volatility. Through an out-of-sample forecasting exercise, we find that the zero-inflated model provides improved point forecasts when zero-inflation is prominent, and better coverage of interval forecasts of the non-zero data by the non-zero distributional component.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to overcome this issue, and propose a new framework called MILLET: Multiple Instance Learning for Locally Explainable Time series classification. We apply MILLET to existing deep learning TSC models and show how they become inherently interpretable without compromising (and in some cases, even improving) predictive performance. We evaluate MILLET on 85 UCR TSC datasets and also present a novel synthetic dataset that is specially designed to facilitate interpretability evaluation. On these datasets, we show MILLET produces sparse explanations quickly that are of higher quality than other well-known interpretability methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work with MILLET, which is available on GitHub (https://github.com/JAEarly/MILTimeSeriesClassification), is the first to develop general MIL methods for TSC and apply them to an extensive variety of domains</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2024. 29 pages (9 main, 3 ref, 17 appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Anomaly Detection Based on Isolation Mechanisms: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10802v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a longstanding and active research area that has many applications in domains such as finance, security, and manufacturing. However, the efficiency and performance of anomaly detection algorithms are challenged by the large-scale, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous data that are prevalent in the era of big data. Isolation-based unsupervised anomaly detection is a novel and effective approach for identifying anomalies in data. It relies on the idea that anomalies are few and different from normal instances, and thus can be easily isolated by random partitioning. Isolation-based methods have several advantages over existing methods, such as low computational complexity, low memory usage, high scalability, robustness to noise and irrelevant features, and no need for prior knowledge or heavy parameter tuning. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art isolation-based anomaly detection methods, including their data partitioning strategies, anomaly score functions, and algorithmic details. We also discuss some extensions and applications of isolation-based methods in different scenarios, such as detecting anomalies in streaming data, time series, trajectory, and image datasets. Finally, we identify some open challenges and future directions for isolation-based anomaly detection research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Representation Learning with Supervised Contrastive Temporal   Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10787v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding effective representations for time series data is a useful but challenging task. Several works utilize self-supervised or unsupervised learning methods to address this. However, there still remains the open question of how to leverage available label information for better representations. To answer this question, we exploit pre-existing techniques in time series and representation learning domains and develop a simple, yet novel fusion model, called: \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{CO}ntrastive \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{T}ransformer (SCOTT). We first investigate suitable augmentation methods for various types of time series data to assist with learning change-invariant representations. Secondly, we combine Transformer and Temporal Convolutional Networks in a simple way to efficiently learn both global and local features. Finally, we simplify Supervised Contrastive Loss for representation learning of labelled time series data. We preliminarily evaluate SCOTT on a downstream task, Time Series Classification, using 45 datasets from the UCR archive. The results show that with the representations learnt by SCOTT, even a weak classifier can perform similar to or better than existing state-of-the-art models (best performance on 23/45 datasets and highest rank against 9 baseline models). Afterwards, we investigate SCOTT's ability to address a real-world task, online Change Point Detection (CPD), on two datasets: a human activity dataset and a surgical patient dataset. We show that the model performs with high reliability and efficiency on the online CPD problem ($\sim$98\% and $\sim$97\% area under precision-recall curve respectively). Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's potential in tackling early detection and show it performs best compared to other candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, IJCNN 2024</p></details> |
| **[MG-TSD: Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion Models with Guided   Learning Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05751v2)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion probabilistic models have attracted attention in generative time series forecasting due to their remarkable capacity to generate high-fidelity samples. However, the effective utilization of their strong modeling ability in the probabilistic time series forecasting task remains an open question, partially due to the challenge of instability arising from their stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion (MG-TSD) model, which achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance by leveraging the inherent granularity levels within the data as given targets at intermediate diffusion steps to guide the learning process of diffusion models. The way to construct the targets is motivated by the observation that the forward process of the diffusion model, which sequentially corrupts the data distribution to a standard normal distribution, intuitively aligns with the process of smoothing fine-grained data into a coarse-grained representation, both of which result in a gradual loss of fine distribution features. In the study, we derive a novel multi-granularity guidance diffusion loss function and propose a concise implementation method to effectively utilize coarse-grained data across various granularity levels. More importantly, our approach does not rely on additional external data, making it versatile and applicable across various domains. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our MG-TSD model outperforms existing time series prediction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Causal Effects using Instrumental Time Series: Nuisance IV   and Correcting for the Past](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06056v2)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instrumental variable (IV) regression relies on instruments to infer causal effects from observational data with unobserved confounding. We consider IV regression in time series models, such as vector auto-regressive (VAR) processes. Direct applications of i.i.d. techniques are generally inconsistent as they do not correctly adjust for dependencies in the past. In this paper, we outline the difficulties that arise due to time structure and propose methodology for constructing identifying equations that can be used for consistent parametric estimation of causal effects in time series data. One method uses extra nuisance covariates to obtain identifiability (an idea that can be of interest even in the i.i.d. case). We further propose a graph marginalization framework that allows us to apply nuisance IV and other IV methods in a principled way to time series. Our methods make use of a version of the global Markov property, which we prove holds for VAR(p) processes. For VAR(1) processes, we prove identifiability conditions that relate to Jordan forms and are different from the well-known rank conditions in the i.i.d. case (they do not require as many instruments as covariates, for example). We provide methods, prove their consistency, and show how the inferred causal effect can be used for distribution generalization. Simulation experiments corroborate our theoretical results. We provide ready-to-use Python code.</p></details> |  |
| **[tsGT: Stochastic Time Series Modeling With Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05713v2)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series methods are of fundamental importance in virtually any field of science that deals with temporally structured data. Recently, there has been a surge of deterministic transformer models with time series-specific architectural biases. In this paper, we go in a different direction by introducing tsGT, a stochastic time series model built on a general-purpose transformer architecture. We focus on using a well-known and theoretically justified rolling window backtesting and evaluation protocol. We show that tsGT outperforms the state-of-the-art models on MAD and RMSE, and surpasses its stochastic peers on QL and CRPS, on four commonly used datasets. We complement these results with a detailed analysis of tsGT's ability to model the data distribution and predict marginal quantile values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rough Transformers for Continuous and Efficient Time-Series Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10288v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data in real-world medical settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In such contexts, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to model irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of moderate lengths and greater. To mitigate this, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model which operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly reduced computational costs, critical for addressing long-range dependencies common in medical contexts. In particular, we propose multi-view signature attention, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global dependencies in input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency. We find that Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the benefits of Neural ODE-based models using a fraction of the computational time and memory resources on synthetic and real-world time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Chaos to Clarity: Time Series Anomaly Detection in Astronomical   Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10220v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of astronomical facilities, large-scale time series data observed by these facilities is being collected. Analyzing anomalies in these astronomical observations is crucial for uncovering potential celestial events and physical phenomena, thus advancing the scientific research process. However, existing time series anomaly detection methods fall short in tackling the unique characteristics of astronomical observations where each star is inherently independent but interfered by random concurrent noise, resulting in a high rate of false alarms. To overcome the challenges, we propose AERO, a novel two-stage framework tailored for unsupervised anomaly detection in astronomical observations. In the first stage, we employ a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to learn the normal temporal patterns on each variate (i.e., star) in alignment with the characteristic of variate independence. In the second stage, we enhance the graph neural network with a window-wise graph structure learning to tackle the occurrence of concurrent noise characterized by spatial and temporal randomness. In this way, AERO is not only capable of distinguishing normal temporal patterns from potential anomalies but also effectively differentiating concurrent noise, thus decreasing the number of false alarms. We conducted extensive experiments on three synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that AERO outperforms the compared baselines. Notably, compared to the state-of-the-art model, AERO improves the F1-score by up to 8.76% and 2.63% on synthetic and real-world datasets respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[MKF-ADS: Multi-Knowledge Fusion Based Self-supervised Anomaly Detection   System for Control Area Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04293v2)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control Area Network (CAN) is an essential communication protocol that interacts between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the vehicular network. However, CAN is facing stringent security challenges due to innate security risks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are a crucial safety component in remediating Vehicular Electronics and Systems vulnerabilities. However, existing IDSs fail to identify complexity attacks and have higher false alarms owing to capability bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised multi-knowledge fused anomaly detection model, called MKF-ADS. Specifically, the method designs an integration framework, including spatial-temporal correlation with an attention mechanism (STcAM) module and patch sparse-transformer module (PatchST). The STcAM with fine-pruning uses one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) to extract spatial features and subsequently utilizes the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract the temporal features, where the attention mechanism will focus on the important time steps. Meanwhile, the PatchST captures the combined contextual features from independent univariate time series. Finally, the proposed method is based on knowledge distillation to STcAM as a student model for learning intrinsic knowledge and cross the ability to mimic PatchST. We conduct extensive experiments on six simulation attack scenarios across various CAN IDs and time steps, and two real attack scenarios, which present a competitive prediction and detection performance. Compared with the baseline in the same paradigm, the error rate and FAR are 2.62\% and 2.41\% and achieve a promising F1-score of 97.3\%.</p></details> |

We introduce TimeMachine, an innovative model that leverages Mamba, a state-space model, to capture long-term dependencies in multivariate time series data while maintaining linear scalability and small memory footprints. TimeMachine exploits the unique properties of time series data to produce salient contextual cues at multi-scales and leverage an innovative integrated quadruple-Mamba architecture to unify the handling of channel-mixing and channel-independence situations, thus enabling effective selection of contents for prediction against global and local contexts at different scales. Experimentally, TimeMachine achieves superior performance in prediction accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency, as extensively validated using benchmark datasets.

Specifically, the Long-Short Term Memory recurrent neural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time series, is employed in the analysis of in-situ measurements of solar wind plasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from $2005$ to $2019$, at the Lagrangian point L$1$. The problem is approached as a binary classification aiming to predict one hour in advance a decrease in the SYM-H geomagnetic activity index below the threshold of $-50$ nT, which is generally regarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class imbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to optimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network. Beside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to evaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced here, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the content of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated with their detection and likelihood of geo-effectiveness, were considered as input features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are demonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the most relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model. The optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting the onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real warnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.</p></details> |  |

The self-supervised representation learning can be categorized into two mainstream: contrastive and generative. In this paper, we will present a comprehensive comparative study between contrastive and generative methods in time series. We first introduce the basic frameworks for contrastive and generative SSL, respectively, and discuss how to obtain the supervision signal that guides the model optimization. We then implement classical algorithms (SimCLR vs. MAE) for each type and conduct a comparative analysis in fair settings. Our results provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and offer practical recommendations for choosing suitable SSL methods. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the broader field of representation learning and propose future research directions.

However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose a deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using a combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. We emphasize the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated time series on the detection of grassland mowing events. We focus on Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compare our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method surpasses these techniques, with an average MAE of 0.024 and R^2 of 0.92. It not only improves the accuracy of event detection tasks by employing a continuous time series, but also effectively filters out sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations that cloud masks often fail to detect.</p></details> |  |
| **[iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series   Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625v4)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent boom of linear forecasting models questions the ongoing passion for architectural modifications of Transformer-based forecasters. These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates that represent potential delayed events and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent duties of Transformer components and repurpose the Transformer architecture without any modification to the basic components. We propose iTransformer that simply applies the attention and feed-forward network on the inverted dimensions. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves state-of-the-art on challenging real-world datasets, which further empowers the Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization ability across different variates, and better utilization of arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCformer: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Mixed-Channels   Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09223v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The massive generation of time-series data by largescale Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates the exploration of more effective models for multivariate time-series forecasting. In previous models, there was a predominant use of the Channel Dependence (CD) strategy (where each channel represents a univariate sequence). Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models primarily rely on the Channel Independence (CI) strategy. The CI strategy treats all channels as a single channel, expanding the dataset to improve generalization performance and avoiding inter-channel correlation that disrupts long-term features. However, the CI strategy faces the challenge of interchannel correlation forgetting. To address this issue, we propose an innovative Mixed Channels strategy, combining the data expansion advantages of the CI strategy with the ability to counteract inter-channel correlation forgetting. Based on this strategy, we introduce MCformer, a multivariate time-series forecasting model with mixed channel features. The model blends a specific number of channels, leveraging an attention mechanism to effectively capture inter-channel correlation information when modeling long-term features. Experimental results demonstrate that the Mixed Channels strategy outperforms pure CI strategy in multivariate time-series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Diverse Perspective Learning with Selection over Multiple   Temporal Poolings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09749v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Time Series Classification (TSC), temporal pooling methods that consider sequential information have been proposed. However, we found that each temporal pooling has a distinct mechanism, and can perform better or worse depending on time series data. We term this fixed pooling mechanism a single perspective of temporal poolings. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal pooling method with diverse perspective learning: Selection over Multiple Temporal Poolings (SoM-TP). SoM-TP dynamically selects the optimal temporal pooling among multiple methods for each data by attention. The dynamic pooling selection is motivated by the ensemble concept of Multiple Choice Learning (MCL), which selects the best among multiple outputs. The pooling selection by SoM-TP's attention enables a non-iterative pooling ensemble within a single classifier. Additionally, we define a perspective loss and Diverse Perspective Learning Network (DPLN). The loss works as a regularizer to reflect all the pooling perspectives from DPLN. Our perspective analysis using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) reveals the limitation of a single perspective and ultimately demonstrates diverse perspective learning of SoM-TP. We also show that SoM-TP outperforms CNN models based on other temporal poolings and state-of-the-art models in TSC with extensive UCR/UEA repositories.</p></details> |

We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 12 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models.

Current methodologies primarily focus on compressing larger models yet at the expense of model accuracy. In this paper, we rethink the problem from the inverse perspective by constructing small/weak models directly and improving their accuracy. Thus, we introduce DiTMoS, a novel DNN training and inference framework with a selector-classifiers architecture, where the selector routes each input sample to the appropriate classifier for classification. DiTMoS is grounded on a key insight: a composition of weak models can exhibit high diversity and the union of them can significantly boost the accuracy upper bound. To approach the upper bound, DiTMoS introduces three strategies including diverse training data splitting to increase the classifiers' diversity, adversarial selector-classifiers training to ensure synergistic interactions thereby maximizing their complementarity, and heterogeneous feature aggregation to improve the capacity of classifiers. We further propose a network slicing technique to alleviate the extra memory overhead incurred by feature aggregation. We deploy DiTMoS on the Neucleo STM32F767ZI board and evaluate it based on three time-series datasets for human activity recognition, keywords spotting, and emotion recognition, respectively. The experiment results manifest that: (a) DiTMoS achieves up to 13.4% accuracy improvement compared to the best baseline; (b) network slicing almost completely eliminates the memory overhead incurred by feature aggregation with a marginal increase of latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Volatile Organic Compounds by Differential Mobility   Spectrometry Based on Continuity of Alpha Curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07066v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Classification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is of interest in many fields. Examples include but are not limited to medicine, detection of explosives, and food quality control. Measurements collected with electronic noses can be used for classification and analysis of VOCs. One type of electronic noses that has seen considerable development in recent years is Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS). DMS yields measurements that are visualized as dispersion plots that contain traces, also known as alpha curves. Current methods used for analyzing DMS dispersion plots do not usually utilize the information stored in the continuity of these traces, which suggests that alternative approaches should be investigated.   Results: In this work, for the first time, dispersion plots were interpreted as a series of measurements evolving sequentially. Thus, it was hypothesized that time-series classification algorithms can be effective for classification and analysis of dispersion plots. An extensive dataset of 900 dispersion plots for five chemicals measured at five flow rates and two concentrations was collected. The data was used to analyze the classification performance of six algorithms. According to our hypothesis, the highest classification accuracy of 88\% was achieved by a Long-Short Term Memory neural network, which supports our hypothesis.   Significance: A new concept for approaching classification tasks of dispersion plots is presented and compared with other well-known classification algorithms. This creates a new angle of view for analysis and classification of the dispersion plots. In addition, a new dataset of dispersion plots is openly shared to public.</p></details> |  |
| **[Covariance Fitting Interferometric Phase Linking: Modular Framework and   Optimization Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08646v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interferometric phase linking (IPL) has become a prominent technique for processing images of areas containing distributed scaterrers in SAR interferometry. Traditionally, IPL consists in estimating consistent phase differences between all pairs of SAR images in a time series from the sample covariance matrix of pixel patches on a sliding window. This paper reformulates this task as a covariance fitting problem: in this setup, IPL appears as a form of projection of an input covariance matrix so that it satisfies the phase closure property. Given this modular formulation, we propose an overview of covariance matrix estimates, regularization options, and matrix distances, that can be of interest when processing multi-temporal SAR data. In particular, we will observe that most of the existing IPL algorithms appear as special instances of this framework. We then present tools to efficiently solve related optimization problems on the torus of phase-only complex vectors: majorization-minimization and Riemannian optimization. We conclude by illustrating the merits of different options on a real-world case study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Non-Decimated Wavelet Packet Features and Transformer Models   for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08630v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article combines wavelet analysis techniques with machine learning methods for univariate time series forecasting, focusing on three main contributions. Firstly, we consider the use of Daubechies wavelets with different numbers of vanishing moments as input features to both non-temporal and temporal forecasting methods, by selecting these numbers during the cross-validation phase. Secondly, we compare the use of both the non-decimated wavelet transform and the non-decimated wavelet packet transform for computing these features, the latter providing a much larger set of potentially useful coefficient vectors. The wavelet coefficients are computed using a shifted version of the typical pyramidal algorithm to ensure no leakage of future information into these inputs. Thirdly, we evaluate the use of these wavelet features on a significantly wider set of forecasting methods than previous studies, including both temporal and non-temporal models, and both statistical and deep learning-based methods. The latter include state-of-the-art transformer-based neural network architectures. Our experiments suggest significant benefit in replacing higher-order lagged features with wavelet features across all examined non-temporal methods for one-step-forward forecasting, and modest benefit when used as inputs for temporal deep learning-based models for long-horizon forecasting.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, various strategies, such as self-supervised learning, have been suggested, but they typically rely on extensive empirical datasets. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we propose a pretraining task termed "frequency pretraining" to pretrain a neural network for sleep staging by predicting the frequency content of randomly generated synthetic time series. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses fully supervised learning in scenarios with limited data and few subjects, and matches its performance in regimes with many subjects. Furthermore, our results underline the relevance of frequency information for sleep stage scoring, while also demonstrating that deep neural networks utilize information beyond frequencies to enhance sleep staging performance, which is consistent with previous research. We anticipate that our approach will be advantageous across a broad spectrum of applications where EEG data is limited or derived from a small number of subjects, including the domain of brain-computer interfaces.</p></details> |

However, effectively capturing cross-dimension and cross-time dependencies in non-stationary time series poses significant challenges, particularly in the context of environmental factors. The spurious correlation induced by the environment confounds the causal relationships between cross-dimension and cross-time dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Caformer (\underline{\textbf{Ca}}usal Trans\underline{\textbf{former}}) for time series analysis from a causal perspective. Specifically, our framework comprises three components: Dynamic Learner, Environment Learner, and Dependency Learner. The Dynamic Learner unveils dynamic interactions among dimensions, the Environment Learner mitigates spurious correlations caused by environment with a back-door adjustment, and the Dependency Learner aims to infer robust interactions across both time and dimensions. Our Caformer demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including long- and short-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection, with proper interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, the vast majority of those works are limited to deterministic predictions, while the knowledge of uncertainty is critical in fields like meteorology and climatology. In this work, we investigate the training of ensembles of models to produce stochastic outputs. We show through experiments on real remote sensing image time series that ensembles of independently trained models are highly overconfident and that using a training criterion that explicitly encourages the members to produce predictions with high inter-model variances greatly improves the uncertainty quantification of the ensembles.</p></details> |  |

This paper applies uncertainty time series analysis (UTSA) to analyze a rumor retweeting behavior on Weibo. First, the rumor forwarding is modeled using uncertain time series, including order selection, parameter estimation, residual analysis, uncertainty hypothesis testing and forecast, and the validity of using uncertain time series analysis is further supported by analyzing the characteristics of the residual plot. The experimental results show that the uncertain time series can better predict the next stage of rumor forwarding. The results of the study have important practical significance for rumor management and the management of social media information dissemination.</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce a Deep Learning (DL)-based feature selection algorithm: Feature Selection through Discrete Relaxation (FSDR), tailored for PTS data. Unlike the existing feature selection algorithms, FSDR learns the important features as model parameters using discrete relaxation, which refers to the process of approximating a discrete optimisation problem with a continuous one. FSDR is capable of accommodating a high number of feature dimensions, a capability beyond the reach of existing DL-based or traditional methods. Through testing on a hyperspectral dataset (i.e., a type of PTS data), our experimental results demonstrate that FSDR outperforms three commonly used feature selection algorithms, taking into account a balance among execution time, $R^2$, and $RMSE$.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeDRL: Disentangled Representation Learning for Multivariate   Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04142v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data in numerous real-world applications (e.g., healthcare and industry) are informative but challenging due to the lack of labels and high dimensionality. Recent studies in self-supervised learning have shown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on labels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing issues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these challenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series representation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings. TimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation of timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the former optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the latter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as transformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments on 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets have shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning approaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 58.02% in MSE and classification by 1.48% in accuracy. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies confirmed the relative contribution of each component in TimeDRL's architecture, and semi-supervised learning evaluations demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, even with limited labeled data.

It works by transporting samples from a high-entropy distribution, such as Gaussian white noise, to a low-energy region using gradient descent. We put this model in the framework of normalizing flows, showing how it can often overfit by losing an unnecessary amount of entropy in the descent. As a remedy, we propose a mean-field microcanonical gradient descent that samples several weakly coupled data points simultaneously, allowing for better control of the entropy loss while paying little in terms of likelihood fit. We study these models in the context of financial time series, illustrating the improvements on both synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSFool: Crafting Highly-Imperceptible Adversarial Time Series through   Multi-Objective Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06388v3)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of recurrent neural network (RNN) models in time series classification (TSC). However, neural networks (NNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which cause real-life adversarial attacks that undermine the robustness of AI models. To date, most existing attacks target at feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, but they cannot perform well on RNN-based TSC. This is due to the cyclical computation of RNN, which prevents direct model differentiation. In addition, the high visual sensitivity of time series to perturbations also poses challenges to local objective optimization of adversarial samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient method called TSFool to craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN-based TSC. The core idea is a new global optimization objective known as "Camouflage Coefficient" that captures the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the class distribution. Based on this, we reduce the adversarial attack problem to a multi-objective optimization problem that enhances the perturbation quality. Furthermore, to speed up the optimization process, we propose to use a representation model for RNN to capture deeply embedded vulnerable samples whose features deviate from the latent manifold. Experiments on 11 UCR and UEA datasets showcase that TSFool significantly outperforms six white-box and three black-box benchmark attacks in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and imperceptibility from various perspectives including standard measure, human study and real-world defense.</p></details> |

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2024, Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%).   https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |

This presents a significant challenge of identifiability: many abstract latent representations may reconstruct observations, yet do they guarantee an adequate identification of the governing dynamics? This paper investigates this challenge from two angles: the use of physics inductive bias specific to the data being modeled, and a learn-to-identify strategy that separates forecasting objectives from the data used for the identification. We combine these two strategies in a novel framework for unsupervised meta-learning of hybrid latent dynamics (Meta-HyLaD) with: 1) a latent dynamic function that hybridize known mathematical expressions of prior physics with neural functions describing its unknown errors, and 2) a meta-learning formulation to learn to separately identify both components of the hybrid dynamics. Through extensive experiments on five physics and one biomedical systems, we provide strong evidence for the benefits of Meta-HyLaD to integrate rich prior knowledge while identifying their gap to observed data.</p></details> |

While time-series forecasting is a well-researched field, predicting complex temporal patterns such as sudden changes in sequential data still poses a challenge with current models. This difficulty stems from minimizing Lp norm distances as loss functions, such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean square error (MSE), which are susceptible to both intricate temporal dynamics modeling and signal shape capturing. Furthermore, these functions often cause models to behave aberrantly and generate uncorrelated results with the original time-series. Consequently, developing a shape-aware loss function that goes beyond mere point-wise comparison is essential. In this paper, we examine the definition of shape and distortions, which are crucial for shape-awareness in time-series forecasting, and provide a design rationale for the shape-aware loss function. Based on our design rationale, we propose a novel, compact loss function called TILDEQ (Transformation Invariant Loss function with Distance EQuilibrium) that considers not only amplitude and phase distortions but also allows models to capture the shape of time-series sequences. Furthermore, TILDE-Q supports the simultaneous modeling of periodic and nonperiodic temporal dynamics. We evaluate the efficacy of TILDE-Q by conducting extensive experiments under both periodic and nonperiodic conditions with various models ranging from naive to state-of-the-art. The experimental results show that the models trained with TILDE-Q surpass those trained with other metrics, such as MSE and DILATE, in various real-world applications, including electricity, traffic, illness, economics, weather, and electricity transformer temperature (ETT).</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages in total, 8 pages main paper, 3 pages references, and 6   pages appendix.

| **[Sparse dynamic network reconstruction through L1-regularization of a   Lyapunov equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05457v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important problem in many areas of science is that of recovering interaction networks from simultaneous time-series of many interacting dynamical processes. A common approach is to use the elements of the correlation matrix or its inverse as proxies of the interaction strengths, but the reconstructed networks are necessarily undirected. Transfer entropy methods have been proposed to reconstruct directed networks but the reconstructed network lacks information about interaction strengths. We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution. We further show how to use prior information on the (non)existence of a few directed edges to drastically improve the quality of the reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Causal Discovery (CD) algorithms can identify the cause-effect relationships among the variables of a system from related observational data with certain assumptions. Over the years, several methods have been developed primarily based on the statistical properties of data to uncover the underlying causal mechanism. In this study, we present an extensive discussion on the methods designed to perform causal discovery from both independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.) data and time series data. For this purpose, we first introduce the common terminologies used in causal discovery literature and then provide a comprehensive discussion of the algorithms designed to identify causal relations in different settings. We further discuss some of the benchmark datasets available for evaluating the algorithmic performance, off-the-shelf tools or software packages to perform causal discovery readily, and the common metrics used to evaluate these methods. We also evaluate some widely used causal discovery algorithms on multiple benchmark datasets and compare their performances. Finally, we conclude by discussing the research challenges and the applications of causal discovery algorithms in multiple areas of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published (05 Sept 2023) in Transactions on Machine Learning Research   (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Observation Time Window Segmentation for Administrative Data   Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16537v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models benefit when allowed to learn from temporal trends in time-stamped administrative data. These trends can be represented by dividing a model's observation window into time segments or bins. Model training time and performance can be improved by representing each feature with a different time resolution. However, this causes the time bin size hyperparameter search space to grow exponentially with the number of features. The contribution of this paper is to propose a computationally efficient time series analysis to investigate binning (TAIB) technique that determines which subset of data features benefit the most from time bin size hyperparameter tuning. This technique is demonstrated using hospital and housing/homelessness administrative data sets. The results show that TAIB leads to models that are not only more efficient to train but can perform better than models that default to representing all features with the same time bin size.</p></details> |  |

We present an intuitive baseline method and discuss its efficiency. We conclude with a comparison of the various methods based on different performance metrics, showing the advantage of using machine learning techniques as a tool in decision making.</p></details> |  |

Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infer...</summary><p>Inference code and model checkpoints available at   https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting</p></details> |

In this paper, we focus on high dimensional setting and seek for sample-size-efficient methodology to determine the level of cointegration. Our investigation centres at a Bayesian approach to analyse the cointegration matrix, henceforth determining the cointegration rank. We design two algorithms and implement them on simulated examples, yielding promising results particularly when dealing with high number of variables and relatively low number of observations. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to empirically investigate the constituents of the S&P 500 index, where low-volatility portfolios can be found during both in-sample training and out-of-sample testing periods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Spatiotemporal Prediction with Bayesian Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07657v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal datasets, which consist of spatially-referenced time series, are ubiquitous in many scientific and business-intelligence applications, such as air pollution monitoring, disease tracking, and cloud-demand forecasting. As modern datasets continue to increase in size and complexity, there is a growing need for new statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and scalable enough to handle large prediction problems. This work presents the Bayesian Neural Field (BayesNF), a domain-general statistical model for inferring rich probability distributions over a spatiotemporal domain, which can be used for data-analysis tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and variography. BayesNF integrates a novel deep neural network architecture for high-capacity function estimation with hierarchical Bayesian inference for robust uncertainty quantification. By defining the prior through a sequence of smooth differentiable transforms, posterior inference is conducted on large-scale data using variationally learned surrogates trained via stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate BayesNF against prominent statistical and machine-learning baselines, showing considerable improvements on diverse prediction problems from climate and public health datasets that contain tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements. The paper is accompanied with an open-source software package (https://github.com/google/bayesnf) that is easy-to-use and compatible with modern GPU and TPU accelerators on the JAX machine learning platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

These models rely primarily on utilizing ground motion records for tasks such as earthquake event classification, localization, earthquake early warning systems, and structural health monitoring. However, the extent to which these models effectively learn from these complex time-series signals has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. We perform a hyperparameter search on two deep learning models to assess their effectiveness in deep learning from ground motion records while also examining the impact of auxiliary information on model performance. Experimental results reveal a strong reliance on the highly correlated P and S phase arrival information. Our observations highlight a potential gap in the field, indicating an absence of robust methodologies for deep learning of single-station ground motion recordings independent of any auxiliary information.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 12 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Short and Long Medical Image   Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07513v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing temporal developments is crucial for the accurate prognosis of many medical conditions. Temporal changes that occur over short time scales are key to assessing the health of physiological functions, such as the cardiac cycle. Moreover, tracking longer term developments that occur over months or years in evolving processes, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is essential for accurate prognosis. Despite the importance of both short and long term analysis to clinical decision making, they remain understudied in medical deep learning. State of the art methods for spatiotemporal representation learning, developed for short natural videos, prioritize the detection of temporal constants rather than temporal developments. Moreover, they do not account for varying time intervals between acquisitions, which are essential for contextualizing observed changes. To address these issues, we propose two approaches. First, we combine clip-level contrastive learning with a novel temporal embedding to adapt to irregular time series. Second, we propose masking and predicting latent frame representations of the temporal sequence. Our two approaches outperform all prior methods on temporally-dependent tasks including cardiac output estimation and three prognostic AMD tasks. Overall, this enables the automated analysis of temporal patterns which are typically overlooked in applications of deep learning to medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical study of periodic autoregressive models with additive noise --   estimation and testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07070v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Periodic autoregressive (PAR) time series with finite variance is considered as one of the most common models of second-order cyclostationary processes. However, in the real applications, the signals with periodic characteristics may be disturbed by additional noise related to measurement device disturbances or to other external sources. Thus, the known estimation techniques dedicated for PAR models may be inefficient for such cases. When the variance of the additive noise is relatively small, it can be ignored and the classical estimation techniques can be applied. However, for extreme cases, the additive noise can have a significant influence on the estimation results. In this paper, we propose four estimation techniques for the noise-corrupted PAR models with finite variance distributions. The methodology is based on Yule-Walker equations utilizing the autocovariance function. It can be used for any type of the finite variance additive noise. The presented simulation study clearly indicates the efficiency of the proposed techniques, also for extreme case, when the additive noise is a sum of the Gaussian additive noise and additive outliers. The proposed estimation techniques are also applied for testing if the data corresponds to noise-corrupted PAR model. This issue is strongly related to the identification of informative component in the data in case when the model is disturbed by additive non-informative noise. The power of the test is studied for simulated data. Finally, the testing procedure is applied for two real time series describing particulate matter concentration in the air.</p></details> | <details><summary>Commu...</summary><p>Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation (2023)</p></details> |
| **[Taming Pre-trained LLMs for Generalised Time Series Forecasting via   Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting has recently gained great success with the rapid growth of deep learning models. However, existing approaches usually train models from scratch using limited temporal data, preventing their generalization. Recently, with the surge of the Large Language Models (LLMs), several works have attempted to introduce LLMs into time series forecasting. Despite promising results, these methods directly take time series as the input to LLMs, ignoring the inherent modality gap between temporal and text data. In this work, we propose a novel Large Language Models and time series alignment framework, dubbed LLaTA, to fully unleash the potentials of LLMs in the time series forecasting challenge. Based on cross-modal knowledge distillation, the proposed method exploits both input-agnostic static knowledge and input-dependent dynamic knowledge in pre-trained LLMs. In this way, it empowers the forecasting model with favorable performance as well as strong generalization abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method establishes a new state of the art for both long- and short-term forecasting.

| **[Dataset Condensation for Time Series Classification via Dual Domain   Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07245v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data has been demonstrated to be crucial in various research fields. The management of large quantities of time series data presents challenges in terms of deep learning tasks, particularly for training a deep neural network. Recently, a technique named \textit{Dataset Condensation} has emerged as a solution to this problem. This technique generates a smaller synthetic dataset that has comparable performance to the full real dataset in downstream tasks such as classification. However, previous methods are primarily designed for image and graph datasets, and directly adapting them to the time series dataset leads to suboptimal performance due to their inability to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in time series data, particularly in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Dataset \textit{\textbf{Cond}}ensation for \textit{\textbf{T}}ime \textit{\textbf{S}}eries \textit{\textbf{C}}lassification via Dual Domain Matching (\textbf{CondTSC}) which focuses on the time series classification dataset condensation task. Different from previous methods, our proposed framework aims to generate a condensed dataset that matches the surrogate objectives in both the time and frequency domains. Specifically, CondTSC incorporates multi-view data augmentation, dual domain training, and dual surrogate objectives to enhance the dataset condensation process in the time and frequency domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms other baselines and learns a condensed synthetic dataset that exhibits desirable characteristics such as conforming to the distribution of the original data.</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Gap between TD Learning and Supervised Learning -- A   Generalisation Point of View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11237v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can stitch pieces of experience to solve a task never seen before during training. This oft-sought property is one of the few ways in which RL methods based on dynamic-programming differ from RL methods based on supervised-learning (SL). Yet, certain RL methods based on off-the-shelf SL algorithms achieve excellent results without an explicit mechanism for stitching; it remains unclear whether those methods forgo this important stitching property. This paper studies this question for the problems of achieving a target goal state and achieving a target return value. Our main result is to show that the stitching property corresponds to a form of combinatorial generalization: after training on a distribution of (state, goal) pairs, one would like to evaluate on (state, goal) pairs not seen together in the training data. Our analysis shows that this sort of generalization is different from i.i.d. generalization. This connection between stitching and generalisation reveals why we should not expect SL-based RL methods to perform stitching, even in the limit of large datasets and models. Based on this analysis, we construct new datasets to explicitly test for this property, revealing that SL-based methods lack this stitching property and hence fail to perform combinatorial generalization. Nonetheless, the connection between stitching and combinatorial generalisation also suggests a simple remedy for improving generalisation in SL: data augmentation. We propose a temporal data augmentation and demonstrate that adding it to SL-based methods enables them to successfully complete tasks not seen together during training. On a high level, this connection illustrates the importance of combinatorial generalization for data efficiency in time-series data beyond tasks beyond RL, like audio, video, or text.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024, Project code:   https://github.com/RajGhugare19/stitching-is-combinatorial-generalisation</p></details> |
| **[Sample Splitting and Assessing Goodness-of-fit of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07158v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental and often final step in time series modeling is to assess the quality of fit of a proposed model to the data. Since the underlying distribution of the innovations that generate a model is often not prescribed, goodness-of-fit tests typically take the form of testing the fitted residuals for serial independence. However, these fitted residuals are inherently dependent since they are based on the same parameter estimates and thus standard tests of serial independence, such as those based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) or distance correlation function (ADCF) of the fitted residuals need to be adjusted. The sample splitting procedure in Pfister et al.~(2018) is one such fix for the case of models for independent data, but fails to work in the dependent setting. In this paper sample splitting is leveraged in the time series setting to perform tests of serial dependence of fitted residuals using the ACF and ADCF. Here the first $f_n$ of the data points are used to estimate the parameters of the model and then using these parameter estimates, the last $l_n$ of the data points are used to compute the estimated residuals. Tests for serial independence are then based on these $l_n$ residuals. As long as the overlap between the $f_n$ and $l_n$ data splits is asymptotically 1/2, the ACF and ADCF tests of serial independence tests often have the same limit distributions as though the underlying residuals are indeed iid. In particular if the first half of the data is used to estimate the parameters and the estimated residuals are computed for the entire data set based on these parameter estimates, then the ACF and ADCF can have the same limit distributions as though the residuals were iid. This procedure ameliorates the need for adjustment in the construction of confidence bounds for both the ACF and ADCF in goodness-of-fit testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Traditional top-down approaches often struggle to capture critical signals in rapidly changing events. As global events evolve swiftly, social media narratives, including instances of disinformation, become significant sources of insights. To address the need for an inductive strategy, we explore a niche social media platform GAB and an established messaging service Telegram, to develop methodologies applicable on a broader scale. This study investigates narrative evolution on these platforms using quantitative corpus-based discourse analysis techniques. Our approach is a novel mode to study multiple social media domains to distil key information which may be obscured otherwise, allowing for useful and actionable insights. The paper details the technical and methodological aspects of gathering and preprocessing GAB and Telegram data for a keyness (Log Ratio) metric analysis, identifying crucial nouns and verbs for deeper exploration. Empirically, this approach is applied to a case study of a well defined event that had global impact: the 2023 Wagner mutiny. The main findings are: (1) the time line can be deconstructed to provide useful data features allowing for improved interpretation; (2) a methodology is applied which provides a basis for generalization. The key contribution is an approach, that in some cases, provides the ability to capture the dynamic narrative shifts over time with elevated confidence. The approach can augment near-real-time assessment of key social movements, allowing for informed governance choices. This research is important because it lays out a useful methodology for time series relevant info-culling, which can enable proactive modes for positive social engagement.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI2024 Workshop on AI for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS)</p></details> |

Advancing beyond earlier generations of wide-area monitoring systems built upon supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and synchrophasor technologies, we argue for a monitoring and control framework based on the streaming of continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) measurements with AI-powered data compression and fault detection.   Methods and Results: The architecture of the proposed design originates from the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of a random process that transforms causally a stationary random process into an innovation sequence with independent and identically distributed random variables. This work presents a generative AI approach that (i) learns an innovation autoencoder that extracts innovation sequence from CPOW time series, (ii) compresses the CPOW streaming data with innovation autoencoder and subband coding, and (iii) detects unknown faults and novel trends via nonparametric sequential hypothesis testing.   Conclusion: This work argues that conventional monitoring using SCADA and phasor measurement unit (PMU) technologies is ill-suited for a future grid with deep penetration of inverter-based renewable generations and distributed energy resources. A monitoring system based on CPOW data streaming and AI data analytics should be the basic building blocks for situational awareness of a highly dynamic future grid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Tuning Parameter Selection for High-Dimensional Vector   Autoregressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06657v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lasso-type estimators are routinely used to estimate high-dimensional time series models. The theoretical guarantees established for Lasso typically require the penalty level to be chosen in a suitable fashion often depending on unknown population quantities. Furthermore, the resulting estimates and the number of variables retained in the model depend crucially on the chosen penalty level. However, there is currently no theoretically founded guidance for this choice in the context of high-dimensional time series. Instead one resorts to selecting the penalty level in an ad hoc manner using, e.g., information criteria or cross-validation. We resolve this problem by considering estimation of the perhaps most commonly employed multivariate time series model, the linear vector autoregressive (VAR) model, and propose a weighted Lasso estimator with penalization chosen in a fully data-driven way. The theoretical guarantees that we establish for the resulting estimation and prediction error match those currently available for methods based on infeasible choices of penalization. We thus provide a first solution for choosing the penalization in high-dimensional time series models.</p></details> |

While the Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) serves as the standard metric for evaluating generative models in image synthesis, a comparable metric for time series data is notably absent. This gap in assessment capabilities stems from the absence of a widely accepted feature vector extractor pre-trained on benchmark time series datasets. In addressing these challenges related to assessing the quality of time series, particularly in the context of Fr\'echet Distance, this work proposes a novel solution leveraging the Fourier transform and Auto-encoder, termed the Fr\'{e}chet Fourier-transform Auto-encoder Distance (FFAD). Through our experimental results, we showcase the potential of FFAD for effectively distinguishing samples from different classes. This novel metric emerges as a fundamental tool for the evaluation of generative time series data, contributing to the ongoing efforts of enhancing assessment methodologies in the realm of deep learning-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ICTIS-2024 on March 8th, 2024</p></details> |

This study uses a novel bandpass bootstrap approach called the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) to investigate the periodically correlated (PC) components including seasonality within US COVID-19 mortality. Bootstrapping to produce confidence intervals (CI) for periodic characteristics such as the seasonal mean requires preservation of the PC component's correlation structure during resampling. While existing bootstrap methods can preserve the PC component correlation structure, filtration of that PC component's frequency from interference is critical to bootstrap the PC component's characteristics accurately and efficiently. The VBPBB filters the PC time series to reduce interference from other components such as noise. This greatly reduces bootstrapped CI size and outperforms the statistical power and accuracy of other methods when estimating the periodic mean sampling distribution. VBPBB analysis of US COVID-19 mortality PC components are provided and compared against alternative bootstrapping methods. These results reveal crucial evidence supporting the presence of a seasonal PC pattern and existence of additional PC components, their timing, and CIs for their effect which will aid prediction and preparation for future COVID-19 responses.</p></details> |

We examine two related, complementary inference tasks: the detection of anomalous graphs within a time series, and the detection of temporally anomalous vertices. We approach these tasks via the adaptation of statistically principled methods for joint graph inference, specifically \emph{multiple adjacency spectral embedding} (MASE). We demonstrate that our method is effective for our inference tasks. Moreover, we assess the performance of our method in terms of the underlying nature of detectable anomalies. We further provide the theoretical justification for our method and insight into its use. Applied to the Enron communication graph and a large-scale commercial search engine time series of graphs, our approaches demonstrate their applicability and identify the anomalous vertices beyond just large degree change.</p></details> |
| **[Estimation of Grouped Time-Varying Network Vector Autoregression Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10117v2)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a flexible time-varying network vector autoregressive model framework for large-scale time series. A latent group structure is imposed on the heterogeneous and node-specific time-varying momentum and network spillover effects so that the number of unknown time-varying coefficients to be estimated can be reduced considerably. A classic agglomerative clustering algorithm with nonparametrically estimated distance matrix is combined with a ratio criterion to consistently estimate the latent group number and membership. A post-grouping local linear smoothing method is proposed to estimate the group-specific time-varying momentum and network effects, substantially improving the convergence rates of the preliminary estimates which ignore the latent structure. We further modify the methodology and theory to allow for structural breaks in either the group membership, group number or group-specific coefficient functions. Numerical studies including Monte-Carlo simulation and an empirical application are presented to examine the finite-sample performance of the developed model and methodology.</p></details> |  |

Central to our approach is that we reconceive time-series forecasting as a self-supervised, multi-patch prediction task, which, compared to traditional contrastive learning or mask-and-reconstruction methods, captures temporal dynamics in patch representations more effectively. Our strategy encompasses two-stage training: (i). a causal continual pre-training phase on various time-series datasets, anchored on next patch prediction, effectively syncing LLM capabilities with the intricacies of time-series data; (ii). fine-tuning for multi-patch prediction in the targeted time-series context. A distinctive element of our framework is the patch-wise decoding layer, which departs from previous methods reliant on sequence-level decoding. Such a design directly transposes individual patches into temporal sequences, thereby significantly bolstering the model's proficiency in mastering temporal patch-based representations. aLLM4TS demonstrates superior performance in several downstream tasks, proving its effectiveness in deriving temporal representations with enhanced transferability and marking a pivotal advancement in the adaptation of LLMs for time-series analysis.</p></details> |  |

Moody PhysioNet Challenge. The aim was to predict neurological recovery from coma following cardiac arrest using clinical data and time-series such as multi-channel EEG and ECG signals. Our modelling approach is multimodal, based on two-dimensional spectrogram representations derived from numerous EEG channels, alongside the integration of clinical data and features extracted directly from EEG recordings. Our submitted model achieved a Challenge score of $0.53$ on the hidden test set for predictions made $72$ hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Our study shows the efficacy and limitations of employing transfer learning in medical classification. With regard to prospective implementation, our analysis reveals that the performance of the model is strongly linked to the selection of a decision threshold and exhibits strong variability across data splits.</p></details> |

Applying a central and functional central limit result for Hilbert-valued martingale difference sequences, the asymptotic behavior of the formulated H-valued empirical process, also indexed by H, is obtained under the null hypothesis. The limiting process is H-valued generalized (i.e., indexed by H) Wiener process, leading to an asymptotically distribution free test. Consistency of the test is also proved. The case of misspecified autocorrelation operator of the ARH(1) process is addressed. The asymptotic equivalence in probability, uniformly in the norm of H, of the empirical processes formulated under known and unknown autocorrelation operator is obtained. Beyond the Euclidean setting, this approach allows to implement goodness of fit testing in the context of manifold and spherical functional autoregressive processes.</p></details> |  |

However, the semantic space of LLMs, established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning with LLM ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embeddings space and perform time series forecasting based on learned prompts from the joint space. We first design a tokenization module tailored for cross-modality alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as prompts to provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations verify the necessity of prompt learning informed by semantic space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Probabilistic Forecasting with Applications in Market   Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743v1)** | 2024-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel generative probabilistic forecasting approach derived from the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series. Under the paradigm of generative artificial intelligence, the proposed forecasting architecture includes an autoencoder that transforms nonparametric multivariate random processes into canonical innovation sequences, from which future time series samples are generated according to their probability distributions conditioned on past samples. A novel deep-learning algorithm is proposed that constrains the latent process to be an independent and identically distributed sequence with matching autoencoder input-output conditional probability distributions. Asymptotic optimality and structural convergence properties of the proposed generative forecasting approach are established. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for merchant storage participants, {(ii) interregional price spread forecasting for interchange markets,} and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate superior performance against leading traditional and machine learning-based forecasting techniques under both probabilistic and point forecast metrics.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fast, effective, and coherent time series modeling using the   sparsity-ranked lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01492v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparsity-ranked lasso (SRL) has been developed for model selection and estimation in the presence of interactions and polynomials. The main tenet of the SRL is that an algorithm should be more skeptical of higher-order polynomials and interactions *a priori* compared to main effects, and hence the inclusion of these more complex terms should require a higher level of evidence. In time series, the same idea of ranked prior skepticism can be applied to the possibly seasonal autoregressive (AR) structure of the series during the model fitting process, becoming especially useful in settings with uncertain or multiple modes of seasonality. The SRL can naturally incorporate exogenous variables, with streamlined options for inference and/or feature selection. The fitting process is quick even for large series with a high-dimensional feature set. In this work, we discuss both the formulation of this procedure and the software we have developed for its implementation via the **fastTS** R package. We explore the performance of our SRL-based approach in a novel application involving the autoregressive modeling of hourly emergency room arrivals at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. We find that the SRL is considerably faster than its competitors, while producing more accurate predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Stati...</summary><p>Statistical Modelling. 2024</p></details> |
| **[Considering Nonstationary within Multivariate Time Series with   Variational Hierarchical Transformer for Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05406v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) has long been an important but challenging task. Due to the non-stationary problem across long-distance time steps, previous studies primarily adopt stationarization method to attenuate the non-stationary problem of the original series for better predictability. However, existing methods always adopt the stationarized series, which ignores the inherent non-stationarity, and has difficulty in modeling MTS with complex distributions due to the lack of stochasticity. To tackle these problems, we first develop a powerful hierarchical probabilistic generative module to consider the non-stationarity and stochastic characteristics within MTS, and then combine it with transformer for a well-defined variational generative dynamic model named Hierarchical Time series Variational Transformer (HTV-Trans), which recovers the intrinsic non-stationary information into temporal dependencies. Being a powerful probabilistic model, HTV-Trans is utilized to learn expressive representations of MTS and applied to forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the efficiency of HTV-Trans on MTS forecasting tasks</p></details> |
| **[Human Observation-Inspired Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving   in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04318v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), trajectory prediction remains a formidable challenge, especially in mixed autonomy environments. Traditional approaches often rely on computational methods such as time-series analysis. Our research diverges significantly by adopting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates principles of human cognition and observational behavior into trajectory prediction models for AVs. We introduce a novel "adaptive visual sector" mechanism that mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. Additionally, we develop a "dynamic traffic graph" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture spatio-temporal dependencies among agents. Benchmark tests on the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets reveal that our model (GAVA) outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 15.2%, 19.4%, and 12.0%, respectively. Our findings underscore the potential of leveraging human cognition principles to enhance the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction algorithms in AVs. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Enhancing Time Series Contrastive Learning: A Dynamic Bad Pair   Mining Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03357v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Not all positive pairs are beneficial to time series contrastive learning. In this paper, we study two types of bad positive pairs that can impair the quality of time series representation learned through contrastive learning: the noisy positive pair and the faulty positive pair. We observe that, with the presence of noisy positive pairs, the model tends to simply learn the pattern of noise (Noisy Alignment). Meanwhile, when faulty positive pairs arise, the model wastes considerable amount of effort aligning non-representative patterns (Faulty Alignment). To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Bad Pair Mining (DBPM) algorithm, which reliably identifies and suppresses bad positive pairs in time series contrastive learning. Specifically, DBPM utilizes a memory module to dynamically track the training behavior of each positive pair along training process. This allows us to identify potential bad positive pairs at each epoch based on their historical training behaviors. The identified bad pairs are subsequently down-weighted through a transformation module, thereby mitigating their negative impact on the representation learning process. DBPM is a simple algorithm designed as a lightweight plug-in without learnable parameters to enhance the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods. Through extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, real-world time series datasets, we demonstrate DBPM's efficacy in mitigating the adverse effects of bad positive pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

While MTS are a valuable tool for clinical prediction, their fusion with other data modalities can possibly result in more thorough insights and more accurate results. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as fundamental tools for identifying and defining underlying patterns in the healthcare domain. However, fundamental improvements in interpretability are needed for DNN models to be widely used in the clinical setting. In this study, we present an approach built on a collection of interpretable multimodal data-driven models that may anticipate and understand the emergence of antimicrobial multidrug resistance (AMR) germs in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada (Madrid, Spain). The profile and initial health status of the patient are modeled using static variables, while the evolution of the patient's health status during the ICU stay is modeled using several MTS, including mechanical ventilation and antibiotics intake. The multimodal DNNs models proposed in this paper include interpretable principles in addition to being effective at predicting AMR and providing an explainable prediction support system for AMR in the ICU. Furthermore, our proposed methodology based on multimodal models and interpretability schemes can be leveraged in additional clinical problems dealing with EHR data, broadening the impact and applicability of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Comparison for Fast Domain Adaptation in Table Service Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05092v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In restaurants, many aspects of customer service, such as greeting customers, taking orders, and processing payments, are automated. Due to the various cuisines, required services, and different standards of each restaurant, one challenging part of making the entire automated process is inspecting and providing appropriate services at the table during a meal. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach for automatically checking and providing services at the table. We initially construct a base model to recognize common information to comprehend the context of the table, such as object category, remaining food quantity, and meal progress status. After that, we add a service recognition classifier and retrain the model using a small amount of local restaurant data. We gathered data capturing the restaurant table during the meal in order to find a suitable service recognition classifier. With different inputs, combinations, time series, and data choices, we carried out a variety of tests. Through these tests, we discovered that the model with few significant data points and trainable parameters is more crucial in the case of sparse and redundant retraining data.</p></details> |

This is at the price of a high storage space and a slow speed in the inference (test) time. To address this issue, we propose Density-Regression, a method that leverages the density function in uncertainty estimation and achieves fast inference by a single forward pass. We prove it is distance aware on the feature space, which is a necessary condition for a neural network to produce high-quality uncertainty estimation under distribution shifts. Empirically, we conduct experiments on regression tasks with the cubic toy dataset, benchmark UCI, weather forecast with time series, and depth estimation under real-world shifted applications. We show that Density-Regression has competitive uncertainty estimation performance under distribution shifts with modern deep regressors while using a lower model size and a faster inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,   2024</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series by Latent Process   Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04915v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data arising in many applications nowadays are high-dimensional. A large number of parameters describe features of these time series. We propose a novel approach to modeling a high-dimensional time series through several independent univariate time series, which are then orthogonally rotated and sparsely linearly transformed. With this approach, any specified intrinsic relations among component time series given by a graphical structure can be maintained at all time snapshots. We call the resulting process an Orthogonally-rotated Univariate Time series (OUT). Key structural properties of time series such as stationarity and causality can be easily accommodated in the OUT model. For Bayesian inference, we put suitable prior distributions on the spectral densities of the independent latent times series, the orthogonal rotation matrix, and the common precision matrix of the component times series at every time point. A likelihood is constructed using the Whittle approximation for univariate latent time series. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for posterior computation. We study the convergence of the pseudo-posterior distribution based on the Whittle likelihood for the model's parameters upon developing a new general posterior convergence theorem for pseudo-posteriors. We find that the posterior contraction rate for independent observations essentially prevails in the OUT model under very mild conditions on the temporal dependence described in terms of the smoothness of the corresponding spectral densities. Through a simulation study, we compare the accuracy of estimating the parameters and identifying the graphical structure with other approaches. We apply the proposed methodology to analyze a dataset on different industrial components of the US gross domestic product between 2010 and 2019 and predict future observations.</p></details> |  |
