| **[Common Trends and Long-Run Identification in Nonlinear Structural VARs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05349v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While it is widely recognised that linear (structural) VARs may fail to capture important aspects of economic time series, the use of nonlinear SVARs has to date been almost entirely confined to the modelling of stationary time series, because of a lack of understanding as to how common stochastic trends may be accommodated within nonlinear models. This has unfortunately circumscribed the range of series to which such models can be applied -- and/or required that these series be first transformed to stationarity, a potential source of misspecification -- and prevented the use of long-run identifying restrictions in these models. To address these problems, we develop a flexible class of additively time-separable nonlinear SVARs, which subsume models with threshold-type endogenous regime switching, both of the piecewise linear and smooth transition varieties. We extend the Granger--Johansen representation theorem to this class of models, obtaining conditions that specialise exactly to the usual ones when the model is linear. We further show that, as a corollary, these models are capable of supporting the same kinds of long-run identifying restrictions as are available in linearly cointegrated SVARs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ii + ...</summary><p>ii + 50 pp., 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Surrogate uncertainty estimation for your time series forecasting black-box: learn when to trust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02834v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models play a vital role in time series forecasting. These models, however, often overlook an important element: point uncertainty estimates. Incorporating these estimates is crucial for effective risk management, informed model selection, and decision-making.To address this issue, our research introduces a method for uncertainty estimation. We employ a surrogate Gaussian process regression model. It enhances any base regression model with reasonable uncertainty estimates. This approach stands out for its computational efficiency. It only necessitates training one supplementary surrogate and avoids any data-specific assumptions. Furthermore, this method for work requires only the presence of the base model as a black box and its respective training data. The effectiveness of our approach is supported by experimental results. Using various time-series forecasting data, we found that our surrogate model-based technique delivers significantly more accurate confidence intervals. These techniques outperform both bootstrap-based and built-in methods in a medium-data regime. This superiority holds across a range of base model types, including a linear regression, ARIMA, gradient boosting and a neural network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Augmentation Policies from A Model Zoo for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06282v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting models typically rely on a fixed-size training set and treat all data uniformly, which may not effectively capture the specific patterns present in more challenging training samples. To address this issue, we introduce AutoTSAug, a learnable data augmentation method based on reinforcement learning. Our approach begins with an empirical analysis to determine which parts of the training data should be augmented. Specifically, we identify the so-called marginal samples by considering the prediction diversity across a set of pretrained forecasting models. Next, we propose using variational masked autoencoders as the augmentation model and applying the REINFORCE algorithm to transform the marginal samples into new data. The goal of this generative model is not only to mimic the distribution of real data but also to reduce the variance of prediction errors across the model zoo. By augmenting the marginal samples with a learnable policy, AutoTSAug substantially improves forecasting performance, advancing the prior art in this field with minimal additional computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[VE: Modeling Multivariate Time Series Correlation with Variate Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06169v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting relies on accurately capturing the correlations among variates. Current channel-independent (CI) models and models with a CI final projection layer are unable to capture these dependencies. In this paper, we present the variate embedding (VE) pipeline, which learns a unique and consistent embedding for each variate and combines it with Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to enhance forecasting performance while controlling parameter size. The VE pipeline can be integrated into any model with a CI final projection layer to improve multivariate forecasting. The learned VE effectively groups variates with similar temporal patterns and separates those with low correlations. The effectiveness of the VE pipeline is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four widely-used datasets. The code is available at: \url{https://github.com/swang-song/VE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A statistical framework for analyzing shape in a time series of random geometric objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01984v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new framework to analyze shape descriptors that capture the geometric features of an ensemble of point clouds. At the core of our approach is the point of view that the data arises as sampled recordings from a metric space-valued stochastic process, possibly of nonstationary nature, thereby integrating geometric data analysis into the realm of functional time series analysis. Our framework allows for natural incorporation of spatial-temporal dynamics, heterogeneous sampling, and the study of convergence rates. Further, we derive complete invariants for classes of metric space-valued stochastic processes in the spirit of Gromov, and relate these invariants to so-called ball volume processes. Under mild dependence conditions, a weak invariance principle in $D([0,1]\times [0,\mathscr{R}])$ is established for sequential empirical versions of the latter, assuming the probabilistic structure possibly changes over time. Finally, we use this result to introduce novel test statistics for topological change, which are distribution-free in the limit under the hypothesis of stationarity. We explore these test statistics on time series of single-cell mRNA expression data, using shape descriptors coming from topological data analysis.</p></details> | revised version |
| **[Symmetry constrained neural networks for detection and localization of damage in metal plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06084v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The present paper is concerned with deep learning techniques applied to detection and localization of damage in a thin aluminum plate. We used data generated on a tabletop apparatus by mounting to the plate four piezoelectric transducers, each of which took turn to generate a Lamb wave that then traversed the region of interest before being received by the remaining three sensors. On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than 99% accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $3.14 \pm 0.21$ mm mean distance error and captured more than 60% of test examples within the diffraction limit. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Convolutional Autoencoder for Assessment of Drive-Cycle Anomalies in Connected Vehicle Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07592v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates a practical and novel method for automated unsupervised fault detection in vehicles using a fully convolutional autoencoder. The results demonstrate the algorithm we developed can detect anomalies which correspond to powertrain faults by learning patterns in the multivariate time-series data of hybrid-electric vehicle powertrain sensors. Data was collected by engineers at Ford Motor Company from numerous sensors over several drive cycle variations. This study provides evidence of the anomaly detecting capability of our trained autoencoder and investigates the suitability of our autoencoder relative to other unsupervised methods for automatic fault detection in this data set. Preliminary results of testing the autoencoder on the powertrain sensor data indicate the data reconstruction approach availed by the autoencoder is a robust technique for identifying the abnormal sequences in the multivariate series. These results support that irregularities in hybrid-electric vehicles' powertrains are conveyed via sensor signals in the embedded electronic communication system, and therefore can be identified mechanistically with a trained algorithm. Additional unsupervised methods are tested and show the autoencoder performs better at fault detection than outlier detectors and other novel deep learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>SSCI2...</summary><p>SSCI2022, 7 pages, 3 Tables, 3 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Kernel-U-Net: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using Custom Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01479v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting task predicts future trends based on historical information. Transformer-based U-Net architectures, despite their success in medical image segmentation, have limitations in both expressiveness and computation efficiency in time series forecasting as evidenced in YFormer. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Kernel-U-Net, a flexible and kernel-customizable U-shape neural network architecture. The kernel-U-Net encoder compresses the input series into latent vectors, and its symmetric decoder subsequently expands these vectors into output series. Specifically, Kernel-U-Net separates the procedure of partitioning input time series into patches from kernel manipulation, thereby providing the convenience of customized executing kernels. Our method offers two primary advantages: 1) Flexibility in kernel customization to adapt to specific datasets; and 2) Enhanced computational efficiency, with the complexity of the Transformer layer reduced to linear. Experiments on seven real-world datasets, demonstrate that Kernel-U-Net's performance either exceeds or meets that of the existing state-of-the-art model in the majority of cases in channel-independent settings. The source code for Kernel-U-Net will be made publicly available for further research and application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Electricity Consumption with Random Walks on Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05934v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider time-series forecasting problems where data is scarce, difficult to gather, or induces a prohibitive computational cost. As a first attempt, we focus on short-term electricity consumption in France, which is of strategic importance for energy suppliers and public stakeholders. The complexity of this problem and the many levels of geospatial granularity motivate the use of an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs). Whilst GPs are remarkable predictors, they are computationally expensive to train, which calls for a frugal few-shot learning approach. By taking into account performance on GPs trained on a dataset and designing a random walk on these, we mitigate the training cost of our entire Bayesian decision-making procedure. We introduce our algorithm called \textsc{Domino} (ranDOM walk on gaussIaN prOcesses) and present numerical experiments to support its merits.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[AnomalyCD: A benchmark for Earth anomaly change detection with high-resolution and time-series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05679v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various Earth anomalies have destroyed the stable, balanced state, resulting in fatalities and serious destruction of property. With the advantages of large-scale and precise observation, high-resolution remote sensing images have been widely used for anomaly monitoring and localization. Powered by the deep representation, the existing methods have achieved remarkable advances, primarily in classification and change detection techniques. However, labeled samples are difficult to acquire due to the low probability of anomaly occurrence, and the trained models are limited to fixed anomaly categories, which hinders the application for anomalies with few samples or unknown anomalies. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose the anomaly change detection (AnomalyCD) technique, which accepts time-series observations and learns to identify anomalous changes by learning from the historical normal change pattern. Compared to the existing techniques, AnomalyCD processes an unfixed number of time steps and can localize the various anomalies in a unified manner, without human supervision. To benchmark AnomalyCD, we constructed a high-resolution dataset with time-series images dedicated to various Earth anomalies (the AnomalyCDD dataset). AnomalyCDD contains high-resolution (from 0.15 to 2.39 m/pixel), time-series (from 3 to 7 time steps), and large-scale images (1927.93 km2 in total) collected globally Furthermore, we developed a zero-shot baseline model (AnomalyCDM), which implements the AnomalyCD technique by extracting a general representation from the segment anything model (SAM) and conducting temporal comparison to distinguish the anomalous changes from normal changes. AnomalyCDM is designed as a two-stage workflow to enhance the efficiency, and has the ability to process the unseen images directly, without retraining for each scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>remot...</summary><p>remote sensing benchmark</p></details> |
| **[Self-convolved Bootstrap for M-regression under Complex Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11724v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper considers simultaneous nonparametric inference for a wide class of M-regression models with time-varying coefficients. The covariates and errors of the regression model are tackled as a general class of nonstationary time series and are allowed to be cross-dependent. A novel and easy-to-implement self-convolved bootstrap procedure is proposed. With only one tuning parameter, the bootstrap facilitates a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent inference of the cumulative regression function for the M-estimators under complex temporal dynamics, even under the possible presence of breakpoints in time series. Our methodology leads to a unified framework to conduct general classes of Exact Function Tests, Lack-of-fit Tests, and Qualitative Tests for the time-varying coefficients. These tests enable one to, among many others, conduct variable selection, check for constancy and linearity, as well as verify shape assumptions, including monotonicity and convexity. As applications, our method is utilized to study the time-varying properties of global climate data and Microsoft stock return, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05529v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The block maxima method is a standard approach for analyzing the extremal behavior of a potentially multivariate time series. It has recently been found that the classical approach based on disjoint block maxima may be universally improved by considering sliding block maxima instead. However, the asymptotic variance formula for estimators based on sliding block maxima involves an integral over the covariance of a certain family of multivariate extreme value distributions, which makes its estimation, and inference in general, an intricate problem. As an alternative, one may rely on bootstrap approximations: we show that naive block-bootstrap approaches from time series analysis are inconsistent even in i.i.d.\ situations, and provide a consistent alternative based on resampling circular block maxima. As a by-product, we show consistency of the classical resampling bootstrap for disjoint block maxima, and that estimators based on circular block maxima have the same asymptotic variance as their sliding block maxima counterparts. The finite sample properties are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments, and the methods are demonstrated by a case study of precipitation extremes.</p></details> | 42 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Optimizing VarLiNGAM for Scalable and Efficient Time Series Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05500v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery is designed to identify causal relationships in data, a task that has become increasingly complex due to the computational demands of traditional methods such as VarLiNGAM, which combines Vector Autoregressive Model with Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model for time series data. This study is dedicated to optimising causal discovery specifically for time series data, which is common in practical applications. Time series causal discovery is particularly challenging due to the need to account for temporal dependencies and potential time lag effects. By designing a specialised dataset generator and reducing the computational complexity of the VarLiNGAM model from \( O(m^3 \cdot n) \) to \( O(m^3 + m^2 \cdot n) \), this study significantly improves the feasibility of processing large datasets. The proposed methods have been validated on advanced computational platforms and tested across simulated, real-world, and large-scale datasets, showcasing enhanced efficiency and performance. The optimised algorithm achieved 7 to 13 times speedup compared with the original algorithm and around 4.5 times speedup compared with the GPU-accelerated version on large-scale datasets with feature sizes between 200 and 400. Our methods aim to push the boundaries of current causal discovery capabilities, making them more robust, scalable, and applicable to real-world scenarios, thus facilitating breakthroughs in various fields such as healthcare and finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Censored Data Forecasting: Applying Tobit Exponential Smoothing with Time Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05412v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a novel approach to forecasting by Tobit Exponential Smoothing with time aggregation constraints. This model, a particular case of the Tobit Innovations State Space system, handles censored observed time series effectively, such as sales data, with known and potentially variable censoring levels over time. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the model structure, including its representation in system equations and the optimal recursive estimation of states. It also explores the benefits of time aggregation in state space systems, particularly for inventory management and demand forecasting. Through a series of case studies, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the model across various scenarios, including hourly and daily censoring levels. The results highlight the model's ability to produce accurate forecasts and confidence bands comparable to those from uncensored models, even under severe censoring conditions. The study further discusses the implications for inventory policy, emphasizing the importance of avoiding spiral-down effects in demand estimation. The paper concludes by showcasing the superiority of the proposed model over standard methods, particularly in reducing lost sales and excess stock, thereby optimizing inventory costs. This research contributes to the field of forecasting by offering a robust model that effectively addresses the challenges of censored data and time aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[GDFlow: Anomaly Detection with NCDE-based Normalizing Flow for Advanced Driver Assistance System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05346v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For electric vehicles, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is designed to assist braking based on driving conditions, road inclines, predefined deceleration strengths, and user braking patterns. However, the driving data collected during the development of ADAS are generally limited and lack diversity. This deficiency leads to late or aggressive braking for different users. Crucially, it is necessary to effectively identify anomalies, such as unexpected or inconsistent braking patterns in ADAS, especially given the challenge of working with unlabelled, limited, and noisy datasets from real-world electric vehicles. In order to tackle the aforementioned challenges in ADAS, we propose Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equation Normalizing Flow (GDFlow), a model that leverages Normalizing Flow (NF) with Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to learn the distribution of normal driving patterns continuously. Compared to the traditional clustering or anomaly detection algorithms, our approach effectively captures the spatio-temporal information from different sensor data and more accurately models continuous changes in driving patterns. Additionally, we introduce a quantile-based maximum likelihood objective to improve the likelihood estimate of the normal data near the boundary of the distribution, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns. We validate GDFlow using real-world electric vehicle driving data that we collected from Hyundai IONIQ5 and GV80EV, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to six baselines across four dataset configurations of different vehicle types and drivers. Furthermore, our model outperforms the latest anomaly detection methods across four time series benchmark datasets. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency in inference time compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Certificate Robustness for Time Series Classification with Efficient Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02802v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 4 tables, 10 pages</p></details> |
| **[TimelyGPT: Extrapolatable Transformer Pre-training for Long-term Time-Series Forecasting in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00817v3)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT have recently achieved great success in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision domains. However, the development of PTMs on healthcare time-series data is lagging behind.This underscores the limitations of the existing transformer-based architectures, particularly their scalability to handle large-scale time series and ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. In this study, we present Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TimelyGPT). TimelyGPT employs an extrapolatable position (xPos) embedding to encode trend and periodic patterns into time-series representations. It also integrates recurrent attention and temporal convolution modules to effectively capture global-local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TimelyGPT on two large-scale healthcare time series datasets corresponding to continuous biosignals and irregularly-sampled time series, respectively. Our experiments show that during pre-training, TimelyGPT excels in learning time-series representations from continuously monitored biosignals and irregularly-sampled time series data commonly observed in longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). In forecasting continuous biosignals, TimelyGPT achieves accurate extrapolation up to 6,000 timesteps of body temperature during the sleep stage transition, given a short look-up window (i.e., prompt) containing only 2,000 timesteps. For irregularly-sampled time series, TimelyGPT with a proposed time-specific inference demonstrates high top recall scores in predicting future diagnoses using early diagnostic records, effectively handling irregular intervals between clinical records. Together, we envision TimelyGPT to be useful in a broad spectrum of health domains, including long-term patient health state forecasting and patient risk trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Exploring Fungal Morphology Simulation and Dynamic Light Containment from a Graphics Generation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05171v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fungal simulation and control are considered crucial techniques in Bio-Art creation. However, coding algorithms for reliable fungal simulations have posed significant challenges for artists. This study equates fungal morphology simulation to a two-dimensional graphic time-series generation problem. We propose a zero-coding, neural network-driven cellular automaton. Fungal spread patterns are learned through an image segmentation model and a time-series prediction model, which then supervise the training of neural network cells, enabling them to replicate real-world spreading behaviors. We further implemented dynamic containment of fungal boundaries with lasers. Synchronized with the automaton, the fungus successfully spreads into pre-designed complex shapes in reality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Siggr...</summary><p>Siggraph Asia 2024 Art Paper</p></details> |
| **[Online Graph Topology Learning from Matrix-valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08020v4)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus is on the statistical analysis of matrix-valued time series, where data is collected over a network of sensors, typically at spatial locations, over time. Each sensor records a vector of features at each time point, creating a vectorial time series for each sensor. The goal is to identify the dependency structure among these sensors and represent it with a graph. When only one feature per sensor is observed, vector auto-regressive (VAR) models are commonly used to infer Granger causality, resulting in a causal graph. The first contribution extends VAR models to matrix-variate models for the purpose of graph learning. Additionally, two online procedures are proposed for both low and high dimensions, enabling rapid updates of coefficient estimates as new samples arrive. In the high-dimensional setting, a novel Lasso-type approach is introduced, and homotopy algorithms are developed for online learning. An adaptive tuning procedure for the regularization parameter is also provided. Given that the application of auto-regressive models to data typically requires detrending, which is not feasible in an online context, the proposed AR models are augmented by incorporating trend as an additional parameter, with a particular focus on periodic trends. The online algorithms are adapted to these augmented data models, allowing for simultaneous learning of the graph and trend from streaming samples. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generative Models for Lumped Rainfall-Runoff Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09904v3)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel generative modeling approach to rainfall-runoff modeling, focusing on the synthesis of realistic daily catchment runoff time series in response to catchment-averaged climate forcing. Unlike traditional process-based lumped hydrologic models that depend on predefined sets of variables describing catchment physical properties, our approach uses a small number of latent variables to characterize runoff generation processes. These latent variables encapsulate the intrinsic properties of a catchment and can be inferred from catchment climate forcing and discharge data. By sampling from the latent variable space, the model generates runoff time series that closely resemble real-world observations. In this study, we trained the generative models using neural networks on data from over 3,000 global catchments and achieved prediction accuracies comparable to current deep learning models and various conventional lumped models, both within the catchments from the training set and from other regions worldwide. This suggests that the runoff generation process of catchments can be effectively captured by a low-dimensional latent representation. Yet, challenges such as equifinality and optimal determination of latent variables remain. Future research should focus on refining parameter estimation methods and exploring the physical meaning of these latent dimensions to improve model applicability and robustness. This generative approach offers a promising alternative for hydrological modeling that requires minimal assumptions about the physical processes of the catchment.</p></details> |  |

| **[Path Development Network with Finite-dimensional Lie Group Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00740v2)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signature, lying at the heart of rough path theory, is a central tool for analysing controlled differential equations driven by irregular paths. Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05042v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from various domains are increasing continuously. Extracting and analyzing the temporal patterns in these series can reveal significant insights. Temporal pattern mining (TPM) extends traditional pattern mining by incorporating event time intervals into extracted patterns, enhancing their expressiveness but increasing time and space complexities. One valuable type of temporal pattern is known as rare temporal patterns (RTPs), which occur rarely but with high confidence. There exist several challenges when mining rare temporal patterns. The support measure is set very low, leading to a further combinatorial explosion and potentially producing too many uninteresting patterns. Thus, an efficient approach to rare temporal pattern mining is needed. This paper introduces our Rare Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (RTPMfTS) method for discovering rare temporal patterns, featuring the following key contributions: (1) An end-to-end RTPMfTS process that takes time series data as input and yields rare temporal patterns as output. (2) An efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining (RTPM) algorithm that uses optimized data structures for quick event and pattern retrieval and utilizes effective pruning techniques for much faster mining. (3) A thorough experimental evaluation of RTPM, showing that RTPM outperforms the baseline in terms of runtime and memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2306.10994</p></details> |
| **[Constructing hierarchical time series through clustering: Is there an optimal way for forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06064v2)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecast reconciliation has attracted significant research interest in recent years, with most studies taking the hierarchy of time series as given. We extend existing work that uses time series clustering to construct hierarchies, with the goal of improving forecast accuracy, in three ways. First, we investigate multiple approaches to clustering, including not only different clustering algorithms, but also the way time series are represented and how distance between time series is defined. We find that cluster-based hierarchies lead to improvements in forecast accuracy relative to two-level hierarchies. Second, we devise an approach based on random permutation of hierarchies, keeping the structure of the hierarchy fixed, while time series are randomly allocated to clusters. In doing so, we find that improvements in forecast accuracy that accrue from using clustering do not arise from grouping together similar series but from the structure of the hierarchy. Third, we propose an approach based on averaging forecasts across hierarchies constructed using different clustering methods, that is shown to outperform any single clustering method. All analysis is carried out on two benchmark datasets and a simulated dataset. Our findings provide new insights into the role of hierarchy construction in forecast reconciliation and offer valuable guidance on forecasting practice.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Data driven synthetic wavefront generation for boundary layer data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04873v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disturbances such as atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects lead to wavefront aberrations, which degrade performance in imaging and laser propagation applications. Adaptive optics (AO) provide a method to mitigate these effects by pre-compensating the wavefront before propagation. However, development and testing of AO systems requires wavefront aberration data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. Simulation methods can be used to generate such data less expensively. For atmospheric turbulence, the Kolmogorov-Taylor model provides a well-defined power spectrum that can be combined with the well-known angular spectrum method to generate synthetic phase screens. However, as aero-optics cannot be similarly generalized, this process cannot be applied to aero-optically relevant phenomena. In this paper, we introduce ReVAR (Re-Whitened Vector Auto-Regression), a novel algorithm for data-driven aero-optic phase screen generation. ReVAR trains on an input time-series of spatially and temporally correlated wavefront images from experiment and then generates synthetic data that captures the statistics present in the experimental data. The first training step of ReVAR distills the input images to a set of prediction weights and residuals. A further step we call re-whitening uses a spatial principal component analysis (PCA) to whiten these residuals. ReVAR then uses a white noise generator and inverts the previous transformation to construct synthetic time-series of data. This algorithm is computationally efficient, able to generate arbitrarily long synthetic time-series, and produces high-quality results when tested on turbulent boundary layer (TBL) data measured from a wind tunnel experiment. Using measured data for training, the temporal power spectral density (TPSD) of data generated using ReVAR closely matches the TPSD of the experimental data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in SPIE Unconventional Imaging, Sensing, and Adaptive Optics 2024 proceedings</p></details> |

In this study, we explore the integration of sleep measures from the previous night into wearable-based mood recognition. To this end, we propose NapTune, a novel prompt-tuning framework that utilizes sleep-related measures as additional inputs to a frozen pre-trained wearable time-series encoder by adding and training lightweight prompt parameters to each Transformer layer. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the inclusion of sleep data using NapTune not only improves mood recognition performance across different wearable time-series namely ECG, PPG, and EDA, but also makes it more sample-efficient. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the best baselines and unimodal variants. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of adding sleep-related measures on recognizing different moods as well as the influence of individual sleep-related measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICMI 2024</p></details> |

However, BP varies significantly across individuals, this inter-patient variability motivates the development of personalized models tailored to each patient's physiology. In this work, we propose a personalized BP forecasting model mainly using electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. This time-series model incorporates 2D representation learning to capture complex physiological relationships. Experiments are conducted on datasets collected from three diverse scenarios with BP measurements from 60 subjects total. Results demonstrate that the model achieves accurate and robust BP forecasts across scenarios within the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard criteria. This reliable early detection of abnormal fluctuations in BP is crucial for at-risk patients undergoing surgery or intensive care. The proposed model provides a valuable addition for continuous BP tracking to reduce mortality and improve prognosis.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

This approach has limitations, particularly in capturing the evolving nature of solar activity. Recognizing the limitations of traditional flare forecasting approaches, our research aims to uncover hidden relationships and the evolutionary characteristics of solar flares and their source regions. Our previously proposed Sliding Window Multivariate Time Series Forest (Slim-TSF) has shown the feasibility of usage applied on multivariate time series data. A significant aspect of this study is the comparative analysis of our updated Slim-TSF framework against the original model outcomes. Preliminary findings indicate a notable improvement, with an average increase of 5\% in both the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS). This enhancement not only underscores the effectiveness of our refined methodology but also suggests that our systematic evaluation and feature selection approach can significantly advance the predictive accuracy of solar flare forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint accepted at the 26th International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (DAWAK 2024)</p></details> |

This assumption frequently leads to inaccurate predictions when applied to real-world data. For example, evidence has shown that classical models overestimate the final pandemic size in the H1N1-2009 and COVID-19 outbreaks. To address this issue, we introduce individual mobility as a key factor in disease transmission and control. We characterize disease dynamics using mobility distribution functions for each compartment and propose a mobility-based compartmental model that incorporates population heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to the classical models, effectively addressing the common overestimation problem. Additionally, we infer mobility distributions from the time series of the infected population. We provide sufficient conditions for uniquely identifying the mobility distribution from a dataset and propose a machine-learning-based approach to learn mobility from both synthesized and real-world data.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

In this article, we employ randomised signature to introduce a generative model for financial time series data in the spirit of reservoir computing. Specifically, we propose a novel Wasserstein-type distance based on discrete-time randomised signatures. This metric on the space of probability measures captures the distance between (conditional) distributions. Its use is justified by our novel universal approximation results for randomised signatures on the space of continuous functions taking the underlying path as an input. We then use our metric as the loss function in a non-adversarial generator model for synthetic time series data based on a reservoir neural stochastic differential equation. We compare the results of our model to benchmarks from the existing literature.</p></details> | 33 pages |

It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Video alignment using unsupervised learning of local and global features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06841v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of video alignment, the process of matching the frames of a pair of videos containing similar actions. The main challenge in video alignment is that accurate correspondence should be established despite the differences in the execution processes and appearances between the two videos. We introduce an unsupervised method for alignment that uses global and local features of the frames. In particular, we introduce effective features for each video frame by means of three machine vision tools: person detection, pose estimation, and VGG network. Then the features are processed and combined to construct a multidimensional time series that represent the video. The resulting time series are used to align videos of the same actions using a novel version of dynamic time warping named Diagonalized Dynamic Time Warping(DDTW). The main advantage of our approach is that no training is required, which makes it applicable for any new type of action without any need to collect training samples for it. Additionally, our approach can be used for framewise labeling of action phases in a dataset with only a few labeled videos. For evaluation, we considered video synchronization and phase classification tasks on the Penn action and subset of UCF101 datasets. Also, for an effective evaluation of the video synchronization task, we present a new metric called Enclosed Area Error(EAE). The results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, such as TCC, and other self-supervised and weakly supervised methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[EgoPoser: Robust Real-Time Egocentric Pose Estimation from Sparse and Intermittent Observations Everywhere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06493v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-body egocentric pose estimation from head and hand poses alone has become an active area of research to power articulate avatar representations on headset-based platforms. However, existing methods over-rely on the indoor motion-capture spaces in which datasets were recorded, while simultaneously assuming continuous joint motion capture and uniform body dimensions. We propose EgoPoser to overcome these limitations with four main contributions. 1) EgoPoser robustly models body pose from intermittent hand position and orientation tracking only when inside a headset's field of view. 2) We rethink input representations for headset-based ego-pose estimation and introduce a novel global motion decomposition method that predicts full-body pose independent of global positions. 3) We enhance pose estimation by capturing longer motion time series through an efficient SlowFast module design that maintains computational efficiency. 4) EgoPoser generalizes across various body shapes for different users. We experimentally evaluate our method and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively while maintaining a high inference speed of over 600fps. EgoPoser establishes a robust baseline for future work where full-body pose estimation no longer needs to rely on outside-in capture and can scale to large-scale and unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024, Code: https://siplab.org/projects/EgoPoser</p></details> |

Cryptocoins are tradable digital assets exchanged for specific trading prices. While history has shown the extreme volatility of such trading prices, the ability to efficiently model and forecast the time series resulting from the exchange price volatility remains an open research challenge. Good results can been achieved with state-of-the-art ML techniques, including Gradient-Boosting Machines (GBMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CryptoAnalytics is a software toolkit to easily train these models and make inference on up-to-date cryptocoin trading price data, with facilities to fetch datasets from one of the main leading aggregator websites, i.e., CoinMarketCap, train models and infer the future trends. This software is implemented in Python. It relies on PyTorch for the implementation of RNNs (LSTM and GRU), while for GBMs, it leverages on XgBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a versatile and transferable digital ecosystem for managing time series data, designed to adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). The system is highly adaptable, cloud-ready, and suitable for deployment in a wide range of settings, from small-scale projects to large-scale monitoring initiatives. The ecosystem comprises three core components: the Sensor Management System (SMS) for detailed metadata registration and management; time.IO, a platform for efficient time series data storage, transfer, and real-time visualization; and the System for Automated Quality Control (SaQC), which ensures data integrity through real-time analysis and quality assurance. The modular architecture, combined with standardized protocols and interfaces, ensures that the ecosystem can be easily transferred and deployed across different environments and institutions. This approach enhances data accessibility for a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, and the public, while fostering collaboration and advancing scientific research in environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Liquid Resistance Liquid Capacitance Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08791v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce liquid-resistance liquid-capacitance neural networks (LRCs), a neural-ODE model which considerably improve the generalization, accuracy, and biological plausibility of electrical equivalent circuits (EECs), liquid time-constant networks (LTCs), and saturated liquid time-constant networks (STCs), respectively. We also introduce LRC units (LRCUs), as a very efficient and accurate gated RNN-model, which results from solving LRCs with an explicit Euler scheme using just one unfolding. We empirically show and formally prove that the liquid capacitance of LRCs considerably dampens the oscillations of LTCs and STCs, while at the same time dramatically increasing accuracy even for cheap solvers. We experimentally demonstrate that LRCs are a highly competitive alternative to popular neural ODEs and gated RNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, on classic time-series benchmarks and a complex autonomous-driving lane-keeping task.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient and Generalizable Symbolic Regression Method for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03986v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis and prediction methods currently excel in quantitative analysis, offering accurate future predictions and diverse statistical indicators, but generally falling short in elucidating the underlying evolution patterns of time series. To gain a more comprehensive understanding and provide insightful explanations, we utilize symbolic regression techniques to derive explicit expressions for the non-linear dynamics in the evolution of time series variables. However, these techniques face challenges in computational efficiency and generalizability across diverse real-world time series data. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{N}eural-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{Mo}nte-Carlo \textbf{T}ree \textbf{S}earch (NEMoTS) for time series. NEMoTS leverages the exploration-exploitation balance of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), significantly reducing the search space in symbolic regression and improving expression quality. Furthermore, by integrating neural networks with MCTS, NEMoTS not only capitalizes on their superior fitting capabilities to concentrate on more pertinent operations post-search space reduction, but also replaces the complex and time-consuming simulation process, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency and generalizability in time series analysis. NEMoTS offers an efficient and comprehensive approach to time series analysis. Experiments with three real-world datasets demonstrate NEMoTS's significant superiority in performance, efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, making it well-suited for large-scale real-world time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Space Energy-based Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03845v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel family of deep dynamical models designed to represent continuous-time sequence data. This family of models generates each data point in the time series by a neural emission model, which is a non-linear transformation of a latent state vector. The trajectory of the latent states is implicitly described by a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE), with the initial state following an informative prior distribution parameterized by an energy-based model. Furthermore, we can extend this model to disentangle dynamic states from underlying static factors of variation, represented as time-invariant variables in the latent space. We train the model using maximum likelihood estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in an end-to-end manner, without requiring additional assisting components such as an inference network. Our experiments on oscillating systems, videos and real-world state sequences (MuJoCo) illustrate that ODEs with the learnable energy-based prior outperform existing counterparts, and can generalize to new dynamic parameterization, enabling long-horizon predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI forecasting of higher-order wave modes of spinning binary black hole mergers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03833v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a physics-inspired transformer model that predicts the non-linear dynamics of higher-order wave modes emitted by quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers. The model forecasts the waveform evolution from the pre-merger phase through the ringdown, starting with an input time-series spanning $ t \in [-5000\textrm{M}, -100\textrm{M}) $. The merger event, defined as the peak amplitude of waveforms that include the $l = |m| = 2$ modes, occurs at $ t = 0\textrm{M} $. The transformer then generates predictions over the time range $ t \in [-100\textrm{M}, 130\textrm{M}] $. We produced training, evaluation and test sets using the NRHybSur3dq8 model, considering a signal manifold defined by mass ratios $ q \in [1, 8] $; spin components $ s^z_{\{1,2\}} \in [-0.8, 0.8] $; modes up to $l \leq 4$, including the $(5,5)$ mode but excluding the $(4,0)$ and $(4,1)$ modes; and inclination angles $\theta \in [0, \pi]$. We trained the model on 14,440,761 waveforms, completing the training in 15 hours using 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the Delta supercomputer. We used 4 H100 GPUs in the DeltaAI supercomputer to compute, within 7 hours, the overlap between ground truth and predicted waveforms using a test set of 840,000 waveforms, finding that the mean and median overlaps over the test set are 0.996 and 0.997, respectively. Additionally, we conducted interpretability studies to elucidate the waveform features utilized by our transformer model to produce accurate predictions. The scientific software used for this work is released with this manuscript.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 appendix, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Practical Forecasting of Cryptocoins Timeseries using Correlation Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03674v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptocoins (i.e., Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin) are tradable digital assets. Ownerships of cryptocoins are registered on distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains). Secure encryption techniques guarantee the security of the transactions (transfers of coins among owners), registered into the ledger. Cryptocoins are exchanged for specific trading prices. The extreme volatility of such trading prices across all different sets of crypto-assets remains undisputed. However, the relations between the trading prices across different cryptocoins remains largely unexplored. Major coin exchanges indicate trend correlation to advise for sells or buys. However, price correlations remain largely unexplored. We shed some light on the trend correlations across a large variety of cryptocoins, by investigating their coin/price correlation trends over the past two years. We study the causality between the trends, and exploit the derived correlations to understand the accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques for time series modeling (e.g., GBMs, LSTM and GRU) of correlated cryptocoins. Our evaluation shows (i) strong correlation patterns between the most traded coins (e.g., Bitcoin and Ether) and other types of cryptocurrencies, and (ii) state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms can be used to forecast cryptocoins price trends. We released datasets and code to reproduce our analysis to the research community.</p></details> |  |

However, often original data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns and regulations. A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to the private dataset. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, the attributes required to train an AI model are distributed among different parties, and the parties cannot share the local data for synthetic data construction due to privacy regulations. In PETS 2024, we recently introduced the first Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network (VFLGAN) for publishing vertically partitioned static data. However, VFLGAN cannot effectively handle time-series data, presenting both temporal and attribute dimensions. In this article, we proposed VFLGAN-TS, which combines the ideas of attribute discriminator and vertical federated learning to generate synthetic time-series data in the vertically partitioned scenario. The performance of VFLGAN-TS is close to that of its counterpart, which is trained in a centralized manner and represents the upper limit for VFLGAN-TS. To further protect privacy, we apply a Gaussian mechanism to make VFLGAN-TS satisfy an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. Besides, we develop an enhanced privacy auditing scheme to evaluate the potential privacy breach through the framework of VFLGAN-TS and synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSFool: Crafting Highly-Imperceptible Adversarial Time Series through Multi-Objective Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06388v4)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of recurrent neural network (RNN) models in time series classification (TSC). However, neural networks (NNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which cause real-life adversarial attacks that undermine the robustness of AI models. To date, most existing attacks target at feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, but they cannot perform well on RNN-based TSC. This is due to the cyclical computation of RNN, which prevents direct model differentiation. In addition, the high visual sensitivity of time series to perturbations also poses challenges to local objective optimization of adversarial samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient method called TSFool to craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN-based TSC. The core idea is a new global optimization objective known as "Camouflage Coefficient" that captures the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the class distribution. Based on this, we reduce the adversarial attack problem to a multi-objective optimization problem that enhances the perturbation quality. Furthermore, to speed up the optimization process, we propose to use a representation model for RNN to capture deeply embedded vulnerable samples whose features deviate from the latent manifold. Experiments on 11 UCR and UEA datasets showcase that TSFool significantly outperforms six white-box and three black-box benchmark attacks in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and imperceptibility from various perspectives including standard measure, human study and real-world defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>27th ...</summary><p>27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'24)</p></details> |

Specifically, edge eigenvalues in the precision matrix are observed if and only if there is a structural change in the autoregressive coefficients.

| **[Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03282v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-recurrent conditions caused by incidents are different from recurrent conditions that follow periodic patterns. Existing traffic speed prediction studies are incident-agnostic and use one single model to learn all possible patterns from these drastically diverse conditions. This study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to improve traffic speed prediction under two separate conditions, recurrent and non-recurrent (i.e., with and without incidents). The MoE leverages separate recurrent and non-recurrent expert models (Temporal Fusion Transformers) to capture the distinct patterns of each traffic condition. Additionally, we propose a training pipeline for non-recurrent models to remedy the limited data issues. To train our model, multi-source datasets, including traffic speed, incident reports, and weather data, are integrated and processed to be informative features. Evaluations on a real road network demonstrate that the MoE achieves lower errors compared to other benchmark algorithms. The model predictions are interpreted in terms of temporal dependencies and variable importance in each condition separately to shed light on the differences between recurrent and non-recurrent conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ecosystem knowledge should replace coexistence and stability assumptions in ecological network modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00333v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative population modelling is an invaluable tool for identifying the cascading effects of ecosystem management and interventions. Ecosystem models are often constructed by assuming stability and coexistence in ecological communities as a proxy for abundance data when monitoring programs are not available. However, a growing body of literature suggests that these assumptions are inappropriate for modelling conservation outcomes. In this work, we develop an alternative for dataless population modelling that instead relies on expert-elicited knowledge of species abundances. While time series abundance data is often not available for ecosystems of interest, these systems may still be highly studied or observed in an informal capacity. In particular, limits on population sizes and their capacity to rapidly change during an observation period can be reasonably elicited for many species. We propose a robust framework for generating an ensemble of ecosystem models whose population predictions match the expected population dynamics, as defined by experts. Our new Bayesian algorithm systematically removes model parameters that lead to unreasonable population predictions without incurring excessive computational costs. Our results demonstrate that models constructed using expert-elicited information, rather than stability and coexistence assumptions, can dramatically impact population predictions, expected responses to management, conservation decision-making, and long-term ecosystem behaviour. In the absence of data, we argue that field observations and expert knowledge are preferred for representing ecosystems observed in nature instead of theoretical assumptions of coexistence and stability.</p></details> |  |

After collecting the performance characteristics of various mobile devices, the device performance profile was fitted by using PCA (principal component analysis) dimensionality reduction and feature engineering methods such as descriptive time series analysis. The ability of performance features and profiles to describe the real-time performance status of devices was understood and studied by applying the TOPSIS method and multi-level weighting processing. A time series model was constructed for the feature set under objective weighting, and multiple sensitivity (real-time, short-term, long-term) performance status perception results were provided to obtain real-time performance evaluation data and long-term stable performance prediction data. Finally, by configuring dynamic AB experiments and overlaying fine-grained power reduction strategies, the usability of the method was verified, and the accuracy of device performance status identification and prediction was compared with the performance of the profile features including dimensionality reduction time series modeling, TOPSIS method and entropy weighting method, subjective weighting, HMA method. The results show that accurate real-time performance perception results can greatly enhance business value, and this research has application effectiveness and certain forward-looking significance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Prediction of COPD Using Machine Learning, Clinical Summary Notes, and Vital Signs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13958v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. In the United States, more than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of individuals living with at least one other chronic health condition. It is the 4th leading cause of death in the country. Over 2.2 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations. Monitoring and predicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. This paper presents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. These models use respiration summary notes, symptoms, and vital signs. To train and test these models, data records containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used. These records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical data obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. We achieved an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of COPD exacerbation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Explanation Space: A New Perspective into Time Series Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01354v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human understandable explanation of deep learning models is necessary for many critical and sensitive applications. Unlike image or tabular data where the importance of each input feature (for the classifier's decision) can be directly projected into the input, time series distinguishable features (e.g. dominant frequency) are often hard to manifest in time domain for a user to easily understand. Moreover, most explanation methods require a baseline value as an indication of the absence of any feature. However, the notion of lack of feature, which is often defined as black pixels for vision tasks or zero/mean values for tabular data, is not well-defined in time series. Despite the adoption of explainable AI methods (XAI) from tabular and vision domain into time series domain, these differences limit the application of these XAI methods in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that allows a model originally trained on time domain to be interpreted in other explanation spaces using existing methods. We suggest four explanation spaces that each can potentially alleviate these issues in certain types of time series. Our method can be readily adopted in existing platforms without any change to trained models or XAI methods. The code is available at https://github.com/shrezaei/TS-X-spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-stationary and Sparsely-correlated Multi-output Gaussian Process with Spike-and-Slab Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03149v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) is commonly used as a transfer learning method to leverage information among multiple outputs. A key advantage of MGP is providing uncertainty quantification for prediction, which is highly important for subsequent decision-making tasks. However, traditional MGP may not be sufficiently flexible to handle multivariate data with dynamic characteristics, particularly when dealing with complex temporal correlations. Additionally, since some outputs may lack correlation, transferring information among them may lead to negative transfer. To address these issues, this study proposes a non-stationary MGP model that can capture both the dynamic and sparse correlation among outputs. Specifically, the covariance functions of MGP are constructed using convolutions of time-varying kernel functions. Then a dynamic spike-and-slab prior is placed on correlation parameters to automatically decide which sources are informative to the target output in the training process. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for efficient model fitting. Both numerical studies and a real case demonstrate its efficacy in capturing dynamic and sparse correlation structure and mitigating negative transfer for high-dimensional time-series data. Finally, a mountain-car reinforcement learning case highlights its potential application in decision making problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Penalized Subgrouping of Heterogeneous Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03085v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interest in the study and analysis of dynamic processes in the social, behavioral, and health sciences has burgeoned in recent years due to the increased availability of intensive longitudinal data. However, how best to model and account for the persistent heterogeneity characterizing such processes remains an open question. The multi-VAR framework, a recent methodological development built on the vector autoregressive model, accommodates heterogeneous dynamics in multiple-subject time series through structured penalization. In the original multi-VAR proposal, individual-level transition matrices are decomposed into common and unique dynamics, allowing for generalizable and person-specific features. The current project extends this framework to allow additionally for the identification and penalized estimation of subgroup-specific dynamics; that is, patterns of dynamics that are shared across subsets of individuals. The performance of the proposed subgrouping extension is evaluated in the context of both a simulation study and empirical application, and results are compared to alternative methods for subgrouping multiple-subject, multivariate time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Likelihood estimation for stochastic differential equations with mixed effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17257v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations provide a powerful tool for modelling dynamic phenomena affected by random noise. In case of repeated observations of time series for several experimental units, it is often the case that some of the parameters vary between the individual experimental units, which has motivated a considerable interest in stochastic differential equations with mixed effects, where a subset of the parameters are random. These models enable simultaneous representation of randomness in the dynamics and variability between experimental units. When the data are observations at discrete time points, the likelihood function is only rarely explicitly available, so for likelihood-based inference to be feasible, numerical methods are needed. We present Gibbs samplers and stochastic EM-algorithms based on augmented data obtained by the simple method for simulation of diffusion bridges in Bladt and S{\o}rensen (2014). This method is easy to implement and has no tuning parameters. The method is, moreover, computationally efficient at low sampling frequencies because the computing time increases linearly with the time between observations. The algorithms can be extended to models with measurement errors. The Gibbs sampler as well as the EM-algorithm are shown to simplify considerably for exponential families of diffusion processes, including many models used in practice. In a simulation study, the estimation methods are shown to work well for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and t-diffusions with mixed effects. Finally, the Gibbs sampler is applied to neuronal data.</p></details> |  |

However, managing heterogeneous and intermittent resources to support machine/deep learning (ML/DL) based workflows poses challenges in resource governance for reliability, and confidentiality for model/data privacy protection. There is a need for approaches to handle the volatility of volunteer edge node availability, and also to scale the confidential data-intensive workflow execution across a large number of VEC nodes. In this paper, we present VECA, a reliable and confidential VEC resource clustering solution featuring three-fold methods tailored for executing ML/DL-based scientific workflows on VEC resources. Firstly, a capacity-based clustering approach enhances system reliability and minimizes VEC node search latency. Secondly, a novel two-phase, globally distributed scheduling scheme optimizes job allocation based on node attributes and using time-series-based Recurrent Neural Networks. Lastly, the integration of confidential computing ensures privacy preservation of the scientific workflows, where model and data information are not shared with VEC resources providers. We evaluate VECA in a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud testbed that features OpenFaaS and MicroK8S to support two ML/DL-based scientific workflows viz., G2P-Deep (bioinformatics) and PAS-ML (health informatics). Results from tested experiments demonstrate that our proposed VECA approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods; especially VECA exhibits a two-fold reduction in VEC node search latency and over 20% improvement in productivity rates following execution failures compared to the next best method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted - IC2E 2024 Conference</p></details> |

State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data into distinct modes, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. In this study, we integrate VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our approach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4, and 10 air quality datasets from various Southeast Asian cities. The effectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it. Additionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural network architectures such as LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and RNN. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following VMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average RMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the DLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE across all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated repository, see https://github.com/Espalemit/VMD-With-LTSF-Linear.git</p></details> |

The approach utilizes a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict monthly accumulations of daily detected fire spots. A summary of the data revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum fire spot values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through rigorous statistical analysis. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to the test and validation sets, and confirming the convergence of the model parameters. The results indicate that the mixed LSTM and GRU model offers improved accuracy in forecasting 12 months ahead, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in fire spot forecasting. In addition to improving forecast accuracy, the proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new avenues for research and development in machine learning and natural phenomenon prediction.

This paper presents a novel synthetic dataset designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in interpreting various forms of data visualizations, including plots like time series, histograms, violins, boxplots, and clusters. Our dataset is generated using controlled parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential real-world scenarios. We employ multimodal text prompts with questions related to visual data in images to benchmark several state-of-the-art models like ChatGPT or Gemini, assessing their understanding and interpretative accuracy. To ensure data integrity, our benchmark dataset is generated automatically, making it entirely new and free from prior exposure to the models being tested. This strategy allows us to evaluate the models' ability to truly interpret and understand the data, eliminating possibility of pre-learned responses, and allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the models' capabilities. We also introduce quantitative metrics to assess the performance of the models, providing a robust and comprehensive evaluation tool. Benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs with this dataset reveals varying degrees of success, highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses in interpreting diverse types of visual data. The results provide valuable insights into the current capabilities of LLMs and identify key areas for improvement. This work establishes a foundational benchmark for future research and development aimed at enhancing the visual interpretative abilities of language models. In the future, improved LLMs with robust visual interpretation skills can significantly aid in automated data analysis, scientific research, educational tools, and business intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[In the Search for Optimal Multi-view Learning Models for Crop Classification with Global Remote Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16582v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying and analyzing cropland is a difficult task due to its dynamic and heterogeneous growth behavior. Usually, diverse data sources can be collected for its estimation. Although deep learning models have proven to excel in the crop classification task, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple inputs, named Multi-View Learning (MVL). The methods used in the MVL scenario can be structured based on the encoder architecture, the fusion strategy, and the optimization technique. The literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a methodological framework for researchers exploring crop classification through an MVL methodology.</p></details> | submitted to journal |
| **[Test-time data augmentation: improving predictions of recurrent neural network models of composites](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02478v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have emerged as an interesting alternative to conventional material modeling approaches, particularly for nonlinear path dependent materials. Remarkable computational enhancements are obtained using RNNs compared to classical approaches such as the computational homogenization method. However, RNN predictive errors accumulate, leading to issues when predicting temporal dependencies in time series data. This study aims to address and mitigate inaccuracies induced by neural networks in predicting path dependent plastic deformations of short fiber reinforced composite materials. We propose using an approach of Test Time data Augmentation (TTA), which, to the best of the authors knowledge, is previously untested in the context of RNNs. The method is based on augmenting the input test data using random rotations and subsequently rotating back the predicted output signal. By aggregating the back rotated predictions, a more accurate prediction compared to individual predictions is obtained. Our analysis also demonstrates improved shape consistency between the prediction and the target pseudo time signal. Additionally, this method provides an uncertainty estimation which correlates with the absolute prediction error. The TTA approach is reproducible with different randomly generated data augmentations, establishing a promising framework for optimizing predictions of deep learning models. We believe there are broader implications of the proposed method for various fields reliant on accurate predictive data driven modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Dynamic Generalized Additive Model for Mortality during COVID-19 Pandemic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02378v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in global mortality rates, the impact of the pandemic on mortality from other causes remains uncertain. To gain insight into the broader effects of COVID-19 on various causes of death, we analyze an Italian dataset that includes monthly mortality counts for different causes from January 2015 to December 2020. Our approach involves a generalized additive model enhanced with correlated random effects. The generalized additive model component effectively captures non-linear relationships between various covariates and mortality rates, while the random effects are multivariate time series observations recorded in various locations, and they embody information on the dependence structure present among geographical locations and different causes of mortality. Adopting a Bayesian framework, we impose suitable priors on the model parameters. For efficient posterior computation, we employ variational inference, specifically for fixed effect coefficients and random effects, Gaussian variational approximation is assumed, which streamlines the analysis process. The optimisation is performed using a coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm and several computational strategies are implemented along the way to address the issues arising from the high dimensional nature of the data, providing accelerated and stabilised parameter estimation and statistical inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeDiT: General-purpose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02322v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advances in building foundation models for texts and video data, there is a surge of interest in foundation models for time series. A family of models have been developed, utilizing a temporal auto-regressive generative Transformer architecture, whose effectiveness has been proven in Large Language Models. While the empirical results are promising, almost all existing time series foundation models have only been tested on well-curated ``benchmark'' datasets very similar to texts. However, real-world time series exhibit unique challenges, such as variable channel sizes across domains, missing values, and varying signal sampling intervals due to the multi-resolution nature of real-world data. Additionally, the uni-directional nature of temporally auto-regressive decoding limits the incorporation of domain knowledge, such as physical laws expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we introduce the Time Diffusion Transformer (TimeDiT), a general foundation model for time series that employs a denoising diffusion paradigm instead of temporal auto-regressive generation. TimeDiT leverages the Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and employs diffusion processes to generate high-quality candidate samples without imposing stringent assumptions on the target distribution via novel masking schemes and a channel alignment strategy. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning-free model editing strategy that allows the seamless integration of external knowledge during the sampling process without updating any model parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on a varity of tasks such as forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 6 Figures, 11 Tables.

Additionally, outside of entropy and information theory, permutations have recently been leveraged as a graph representation, which opens the door for graph theory tools and analysis. Despite the successful application of permutations in a variety of scientific domains, permutations requires a judicious choice of the delay parameter $\tau$ and dimension $n$. However, $n$ is typically selected within an accepted range giving optimal results for the majority of systems. Therefore, in this work we focus on choosing the delay parameter, while giving some general guidance on the appropriate selection of $n$ based on a statistical analysis of the permutation distribution. Selecting $\tau$ is often accomplished using trial and error guided by the expertise of domain scientists. However, in this paper, we show how persistent homology, a commonly used tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), provides methods for the automatic selection of $\tau$. We evaluate the successful identification of a suitable $\tau$ from our TDA-based approach by comparing our results to both expert suggested parameters from published literature and optimized parameters (if possible) for a wide variety of dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Max M.

Using data from a real-world maternal health program, we demonstrate how a cognitive model based on Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory can augment existing purely computational approaches. Our findings show that, compared to general time-series forecasters (e.g., LSTMs), IBL models, which reflect human decision-making processes, better predict the dynamics of individuals' states. Additionally, IBL provides estimates of the volatility in individuals' states and their sensitivity to interventions, which can improve the efficiency of training of other time series models.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting.

It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Traffic flow Prediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable traffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for explainable prediction of traffic flows.</p></details> | 31pages, 16 figures |

We utilize autoencoders to compress the entire time series and then apply anomaly detection techniques to its latent features. For outlier interpretation, we (i) adopt widely used XAI techniques to the autoencoder's encoder. Additionally, (ii) we propose AEE, Aggregated Explanatory Ensemble, a novel approach that fuses explanations of multiple XAI techniques into a single, more expressive interpretation.

However, there is no effective way to verify whether they can meet the requirements for real-world deployment. Firstly, current algorithms typically train a specific model for each time series. Maintaining such many models is impractical in a large-scale system with tens of thousands of curves. The performance of using merely one unified model to detect anomalies remains unknown. Secondly, most TSAD models are trained on the historical part of a time series and are tested on its future segment. In distributed systems, however, there are frequent system deployments and upgrades, with new, previously unseen time series emerging daily. The performance of testing newly incoming unseen time series on current TSAD algorithms remains unknown. Lastly, the assumptions of the evaluation metrics in existing benchmarks are far from practical demands. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose an industrial-grade benchmark TimeSeriesBench. We assess the performance of existing algorithms across more than 168 evaluation settings and provide comprehensive analysis for the future design of anomaly detection algorithms. An industrial dataset is also released along with TimeSeriesBench.</p></details> | Accepted by ISSRE'24 |

This paper proposes a threshold spatial GARCH-type model for high-dimensional count data with network structure. The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by taking use of the network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetry in dynamics of volatilities by adopting a threshold structure. Our model is called Poisson Threshold Network GARCH model, because the conditional distributions are assumed to be Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of our maximum-likelihood-estimator (MLE) for the proposed spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension go to infinity. We get asymptotic statistical inferences via investigating the week dependence among components of the model and using limit theorems for weekly dependent random fields. Simulations are conducted to test the theoretical results, and the model is fitted to real count data as illustration of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

Our focus is on predicting wave heights, utilizing models based on topological features within feedforward neural networks (FNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and RNNs with gated recurrent units (GRU). For time-ahead predictions, the enhancements in $R^2$ score were significant for FNNs, RNNs, LSTM, and GRU models. Additionally, these models also showed significant reductions in maximum errors and mean squared errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal training of finitely-sampled quantum reservoir computers for forecasting of chaotic dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01394v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the presence of noise deteriorates the performance of quantum computing algorithms. Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) is a type of Quantum Machine Learning algorithm, which, however, can benefit from different types of tuned noise. In this paper, we analyse the effect that finite-sampling noise has on the chaotic time-series prediction capabilities of QRC and Recurrence-free Quantum Reservoir Computing (RF-QRC). First, we show that, even without a recurrent loop, RF-QRC contains temporal information about previous reservoir states using leaky integrated neurons. This makes RF-QRC different from Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELM). Second, we show that finite sampling noise degrades the prediction capabilities of both QRC and RF-QRC while affecting QRC more due to the propagation of noise. Third, we optimize the training of the finite-sampled quantum reservoir computing framework using two methods: (a) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) applied to the data matrix containing noisy reservoir activation states; and (b) data-filtering techniques to remove the high-frequencies from the noisy reservoir activation states. We show that denoising reservoir activation states improve the signal-to-noise ratios with smaller training loss. Finally, we demonstrate that the training and denoising of the noisy reservoir activation signals in RF-QRC are highly parallelizable on multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) as compared to the QRC architecture with recurrent connections. The analyses are numerically showcased on prototypical chaotic dynamical systems with relevance to turbulence. This work opens opportunities for using quantum reservoir computing with finite samples for time-series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> | 11 pages, 14 figures |

First, we propose formulating convolutional kernel learning for univariate time series as a sparse regression problem with a non-negative constraint, leveraging the properties of circular convolution and circulant matrices. Second, to generalize this approach to multivariate and multidimensional time series data, we use tensor computations, reformulating the convolutional kernel learning problem in the form of tensors. This is further converted into a standard sparse regression problem through vectorization and tensor unfolding operations. In the proposed methodology, the optimization problem is addressed using the existing non-negative subspace pursuit method, enabling the convolutional kernel to capture temporal correlations and patterns. To evaluate the proposed model, we apply it to several real-world time series datasets. On the multidimensional rideshare and taxi trip data from New York City and Chicago, the convolutional kernels reveal interpretable local correlations and cyclical patterns, such as weekly seasonality. In the context of multidimensional fluid flow data, both local and nonlocal correlations captured by the convolutional kernels can reinforce tensor factorization, leading to performance improvements in fluid flow reconstruction tasks. Thus, this study lays an insightful foundation for automatically learning convolutional kernels from time series data, with an emphasis on interpretability through sparsity and non-negativity constraints.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Financial Time Series Denoiser Based on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02138v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio, posing significant challenges for accurate data interpretation and prediction and ultimately decision making. Generative models have gained attention as powerful tools for simulating and predicting intricate data patterns, with the diffusion model emerging as a particularly effective method. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing the diffusion model as a denoiser for financial time series in order to improve data predictability and trading performance. By leveraging the forward and reverse processes of the conditional diffusion model to add and remove noise progressively, we reconstruct original data from noisy inputs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that diffusion model-based denoised time series significantly enhance the performance on downstream future return classification tasks. Moreover, trading signals derived from the denoised data yield more profitable trades with fewer transactions, thereby minimizing transaction costs and increasing overall trading efficiency. Finally, we show that by using classifiers trained on denoised time series, we can recognize the noising state of the market and obtain excess return.</p></details> |  |
| **[Order-preserving pattern mining with forgetting mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15563v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Order-preserving pattern (OPP) mining is a type of sequential pattern mining method in which a group of ranks of time series is used to represent an OPP. This approach can discover frequent trends in time series. Existing OPP mining algorithms consider data points at different time to be equally important; however, newer data usually have a more significant impact, while older data have a weaker impact. We therefore introduce the forgetting mechanism into OPP mining to reduce the importance of older data. This paper explores the mining of OPPs with forgetting mechanism (OPF) and proposes an algorithm called OPF-Miner that can discover frequent OPFs. OPF-Miner performs two tasks, candidate pattern generation and support calculation. In candidate pattern generation, OPF-Miner employs a maximal support priority strategy and a group pattern fusion strategy to avoid redundant pattern fusions. For support calculation, we propose an algorithm called support calculation with forgetting mechanism, which uses prefix and suffix pattern pruning strategies to avoid redundant support calculations. The experiments are conducted on nine datasets and 12 alternative algorithms. The results verify that OPF-Miner is superior to other competitive algorithms. More importantly, OPF-Miner yields good clustering performance for time series, since the forgetting mechanism is employed.</p></details> |  |

Different TSDBs have test reports comparing themselves with other databases to show their advantages, but the comparisons are typically based on their own tools without using a common well-recognized test framework. To the best of our knowledge, there is no mature TSDB benchmark either. With the goal of establishing a standard of evaluating TSDB systems, we present the IoTDB-Benchmark framework, specifically designed for TSDB and IoT application scenarios. We pay close attention to some special data ingestion scenarios and summarize 10 basic queries types. We use this benchmark to compare four TSDB systems: InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, KairosDB and TimescaleDB. Our benchmark framework/tool not only measures performance metrics but also takes system resource consumption into consideration.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting sea ice poses a significant challenge due to the intricate interaction among multiple variables. Leveraging the capability to integrate multiple inputs and powerful performances seamlessly, many studies have turned to neural networks for sea ice forecasting. This paper introduces a novel deep architecture named Unicorn, designed to forecast weekly sea ice. Our model integrates multiple time series images within its architecture to enhance its forecasting performance. Moreover, we incorporate a bottleneck layer within the U-Net architecture, serving as neural ordinary differential equations with convolution operations, to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of latent variables. Through real data analysis with datasets spanning from 1998 to 2021, our proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in the sea ice concentration forecasting task. It achieves an average MAE improvement of 12% compared to benchmark models. Additionally, our method outperforms existing approaches in sea ice extent forecasting, achieving a classification performance improvement of approximately 18%. These experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method: State Estimation from Few Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16411v2)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) estimates a function from its incomplete pointwise measurements. Unfortunately, DEIM suffers large interpolation errors when few measurements are available. Here, we introduce Sparse DEIM (S-DEIM) for accurately estimating a function even when very few measurements are available. To this end, S-DEIM leverages a kernel vector which has been neglected in previous DEIM-based methods. We derive theoretical error estimates for S-DEIM, showing its relatively small error when an optimal kernel vector is used. When the function is generated by a continuous-time dynamical system, we propose a data assimilation algorithm which approximates the optimal kernel vector using observational time series. We prove that, under certain conditions, data assimilated S-DEIM converges exponentially fast towards the true state. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions.

Tsutsumi, K. Nakai and Y. Saiki, Chaos 32, 091101 (2022)], we proposed a method for constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior from only observable deterministic time series, which we call the radial function-based regression (RfR) method. However, when the targeted variable's behavior is rather complex, the direct application of the RfR method does not function well. In this study, we propose a novel method of modeling such dynamics, including the high-frequency intermittent behavior of a fluid flow, by considering another variable (base variable) showing relatively simple, less intermittent behavior. We construct an autonomous joint model composed of two parts: the first is an autonomous system of a base variable, and the other concerns the targeted variable being affected by a term involving the base variable to demonstrate complex dynamics. The constructed joint model succeeded in not only inferring a short trajectory but also reconstructing chaotic sets and statistical properties obtained from a long trajectory such as the density distributions of the actual dynamics.</p></details> | 7pages, 6figures |

| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v5)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main part of this manuscript (except the part on DRE) has been accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshop HALF-CENTURY OF STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (50SFM)</p></details> |

In this approach, the RCM-constraint is upheld algorithmically, providing flexibility in the positioning of the insertion point and enabling compatibility with a wide range of general-purpose robots. The paper further investigates the impact of the tool's insertion ratio on the RCM-error, and introduces a manipulability index of the robot which considers the RCM-error that it is used to find a starting configuration. To accurately evaluate the proposed method's trajectory tracking within an RCM-constrained environment, an electromagnetic tracking system is employed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the RCM constraint problem in RA-MIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Jointly Learning Cost and Constraints from Demonstrations for Safe Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03491v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration allows robots to mimic human actions. However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Acce...</summary><p>(Accepted/In press) 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory-guided method, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection tasks and no need for the effort required for labeling. The PIC technique forms the foundation for developing UAVDB, a database explicitly created for UAV detection. Unlike existing datasets, which often use low-resolution footage or focus on UAVs in simple backgrounds, UAVDB employs high-resolution video to capture UAVs at various scales, ranging from hundreds of pixels to nearly single-digit sizes. This broad-scale variation enables comprehensive evaluation of detection algorithms across different UAV sizes and distances. Applying the PIC technique, we can also efficiently generate detection datasets from trajectory or positional data, even without size information. We extensively benchmark UAVDB using YOLOv8 series detectors, offering a detailed performance analysis. Our findings highlight UAVDB's potential as a vital database for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow, nor planning with horizons, leading strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce our trajectory planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) bootstrapped by BC for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference trajectory, and performs modified path for different controllers. Our experimental results show that the algorithm can do path-tracking that mimics the expert performance, and avoiding collision to fixed obstacles by trial and errors. This method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in trajectory planning problems of autonomous driving.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Marginal Structural Modeling of Representative Treatment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04933v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marginal structural models (MSMs) are widely used in observational studies to estimate the causal effect of time-varying treatments. Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results. We apply the method to analyze data from an existing cohort of lung transplant recipients to estimate the effect of Tacrolimus concentrations on the risk of incident chronic kidney disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Moving Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to more precise source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. Initially, sound separation is conducted using rough preliminary sound source tracking results. Sound source tracking is then performed on the separated signals thus the tracking results can become more precise. The precise trajectory can further enhances the separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be performed over several iterations. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberation conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on more precise tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v5)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Conventional methods of optimizing the spray gun trajectory based on simulated thickness can only qualitatively reflect the color distribution, and can not simulate the color effect of spray painting at the pixel level. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately control the area covered by the color and the gradation of the edges of the area, and it is also difficult to deal with the situation where multiple colors of paint are sprayed in combination. To solve the above problems, this paper is inspired by the Kubelka-Munk model and combines the 3D machine vision method and artificial neural network to propose a spray painting color effect prediction method. The method is enabled to predict the execution effect of the spray gun trajectory with pixel-level accuracy from the dimension of the surface color of the workpiece after spray painting. On this basis, the method can be used to replace the traditional thickness simulation method to establish the objective function of the spray gun trajectory optimization problem, and thus solve the difficult problem of spray gun trajectory optimization for multi-color paint combination spraying. In this paper, the mathematical model of the spray painting color effect prediction problem is first determined through the analysis of the Kubelka-Munk paint film color rendering model, and at the same time, the spray painting color effect dataset is established with the help of the depth camera and point cloud processing algorithm. After that, the multilayer perceptron model was improved with the help of gating and residual structure and was used for the color prediction task. To verify ...</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimizing Profilometric Sensor Trajectories for Surface Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03429v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision surface defect detection in manufacturing is essential for ensuring quality control. Laser triangulation profilometric sensors are key to this process, providing detailed and accurate surface measurements over a line. To achieve a complete and precise surface scan, accurate relative motion between the sensor and the workpiece is required. It is crucial to control the sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Online Trajectory Planning for Adaptive Battery Discharging in Fuel Cell Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03201v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an online trajectory planning approach for optimal coordination of Fuel Cell (FC) and battery in plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). One of the main challenges in energy management of plug-in HEV is generating State-of-Charge (SOC) reference curves by optimally depleting battery under high uncertainties in driving scenarios. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of utilizing partial trip information for optimal SOC trajectory planning, but dynamic responses of the FC system are not taken into account. On the other hand, research focusing on dynamic operation of FC systems often focuses on air flow management, and battery has been treated only partially. Our aim is to fill this gap by designing an online trajectory planner for dynamic coordination of FC and battery systems that works with a high-level SOC planner in a hierarchical manner. We propose an iterative LQR based online trajectory planning method where the amount of electricity dischargeable at each driving segment can be explicitly and adaptively specified by the high-level planner. Numerical results are provided as a proof of concept example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADiff: Motion-Aware Mamba Diffusion Models for Hand Trajectory Prediction on Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02638v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human intentions and actions through egocentric videos is important on the path to embodied artificial intelligence. As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional equations and Machine Learning (ML) models using clinical and laboratory data can estimate eGFR, accurately predicting future eGFR levels remains a significant challenge for nephrologists and ML researchers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can serve as robust foundation models for diverse applications. This study investigates the potential of LMMs to predict future eGFR levels with a dataset consisting of laboratory and clinical values from 50 patients. By integrating various prompting techniques and ensembles of LMMs, our findings suggest that these models, when combined with precise prompts and visual representations of eGFR trajectories, offer predictive performance comparable to existing ML models.

Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer for Incomplete Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00904v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle's motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from highway and urban traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g., a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2025.

While outdoor trajectory forecasting has received significant attention, indoor forecasting is still an underexplored research area. This paper proposes SITUATE, a novel approach to cope with indoor human trajectory prediction by leveraging equivariant and invariant geometric features and a self-supervised vision representation. The geometric learning modules model the intrinsic symmetries and human movements inherent in indoor spaces. This concept becomes particularly important because self-loops at various scales and rapid direction changes often characterize indoor trajectories. On the other hand, the vision representation module is used to acquire spatial-semantic information about the environment to predict users' future locations more accurately. We evaluate our method through comprehensive experiments on the two most famous indoor trajectory forecasting datasets, i.e., TH\"OR and Supermarket, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also achieve competitive results in outdoor scenarios, showing that indoor-oriented forecasting models generalize better than outdoor-oriented ones.

| **[TrajWeaver: Trajectory Recovery with State Propagation Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02124v1)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of location-aware devices, large amount of trajectories have been generated when agents such as people, vehicles and goods flow around the urban environment. These raw trajectories, typically collected from various sources such as GPS in cars, personal mobile devices, and public transport, are often sparse and fragmented due to limited sampling rates, infrastructure coverage and data loss. In this context, trajectory recovery aims to reconstruct such sparse raw trajectories into their dense and continuous counterparts, so that fine-grained movement of agents across space and time can be captured faithfully. Existing trajectory recovery approaches typically rely on the prior knowledge of travel mode or motion patterns, and often fail in densely populated urban areas where accurate maps are absent. In this paper, we present a new recovery framework called TrajWeaver based on probabilistic diffusion models, which is able to recover dense and refined trajectories from the sparse raw ones, conditioned on various auxiliary features such as Areas of Interest along the way, user identity and waybill information. The core of TrajWeaver is a novel State Propagation Diffusion Model (SPDM), which introduces a new state propagation mechanism on top of the standard diffusion models, so that knowledge computed in earlier diffusion steps can be reused later, improving the recovery performance while reducing the number of steps needed. Extensive experiments show that the proposed TrajWeaver can recover from raw trajectories of various lengths, sparsity levels and heterogeneous travel modes, and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines significantly in recovery accuracy.

In particular, the encounter of a vehicle with a dilemma zone (DZ) at a roundabout intersection is a pivotal concern. This paper presents an automated system that leverages trajectory forecasting to predict DZ events, specifically at traffic roundabouts. Our system aims to enhance safety standards in both autonomous and manual transportation. The core of our approach is a modular, graph-structured recurrent model that forecasts the trajectories of diverse agents, taking into account agent dynamics and integrating heterogeneous data, such as semantic maps. This model, based on graph neural networks, aids in predicting DZ events and enhances traffic management decision-making. We evaluated our system using a real-world dataset of traffic roundabout intersections. Our experimental results demonstrate that our dilemma forecasting system achieves a high precision with a low false positive rate of 0.1. This research represents an advancement in roundabout DZ data mining and forecasting, contributing to the assurance of intersection safety in the era of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

We utilize one of the large language models (LLMs) (i.e., GPT-J) to encode the string format of trajectories and then evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM-based representation for trajectory data analysis. The experiments demonstrate that while the LLM-based embeddings can preserve certain trajectory distance metrics (i.e., the correlation coefficients exceed 0.74 between the Cosine distance derived from GPT-J embeddings and the Hausdorff and Dynamic Time Warping distances on raw trajectories), challenges remain in restoring numeric values and retrieving spatial neighbors in movement trajectory analytics. In addition, the LLMs can understand the spatiotemporal dependency contained in trajectories and have good accuracy in location prediction tasks. This research highlights the need for improvement in terms of capturing the nuances and complexities of the underlying geospatial data and integrating domain knowledge to support various GeoAI applications using LLMs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures; 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

We formulate an expression for the information gathered over an observation period based on the mutual information between augmented observer/target states and the associated measurement set collected. We then develop an optimal trajectory design problem for a mobile observer, balancing information gain and control effort, and solve this problem with a Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach. The developed methods are demonstrated in scenarios involving spacecraft in the cislunar regime, demonstrating the potential for improved autonomous navigation and tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

First, a novel multivariable fixed-time disturbance observer is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances. The bi-limit homogeneity and Lyapunov techniques are employed to ensure the convergence of estimation error within a fixed convergence time, independent of the initial estimation error. Then, an observerbased model predictive control strategy is formulated to achieve robust trajectory tracking of quadrotor, attenuating the lumped disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, simulations and real-world experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Via theoretical analysis, the inter-agent collision is proved to be avoided and the allocation ensures timely updates. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons with five baselines validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate its improvement in completion time and moving distance. Finally, hardware experiments are carried out, where $8$ heterogeneous unmanned ground vehicles with onboard computation navigate in cluttered scenarios with high agility.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Given the heavy reliance of current trajectory forecasting models on data-driven methodologies, we aim to tackle the challenge of learning general trajectory forecasting representations under limited data availability. We propose a pipeline-level solution to mitigate the issue of data scarcity in trajectory forecasting. The solution is composed of two parts: firstly, we adopt HD map augmentation and trajectory synthesis for generating driving data, and then we learn representations by pre-training on them. Specifically, we apply vector transformations to reshape the maps, and then employ a rule-based model to generate trajectories on both original and augmented scenes; thus enlarging the driving data without collecting additional real ones. To foster the learning of general representations within this augmented dataset, we comprehensively explore the different pre-training strategies, including extending the concept of a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) for trajectory forecasting. Without bells and whistles, our proposed pipeline-level solution is general, simple, yet effective: we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our data expansion and pre-training strategies, which outperform the baseline prediction model by large margins, e.g. 5.04%, 3.84% and 8.30% in terms of $MR_6$, $minADE_6$ and $minFDE_6$.

| **[Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for One-step Diffusion Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15991v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions-i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geo-Llama: Leveraging LLMs for Human Mobility Trajectory Generation with Spatiotemporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13918v2)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating human mobility data is essential for various application domains, including transportation, urban planning, and epidemic control, since real data are often inaccessible to researchers due to expensive costs and privacy issues. Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Artifact Correction for Symmetric Multi-Linear Trajectory CT: Theory, Method, and Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15069v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For extending CT field-of-view to perform non-destructive testing, the Symmetric Multi-Linear trajectory Computed Tomography (SMLCT) has been developed as a successful example of non-standard CT scanning modes. However, inevitable geometric errors can cause severe artifacts in the reconstructed images. The existing calibration method for SMLCT is both crude and inefficient. It involves reconstructing hundreds of images by exhaustively substituting each potential error, and then manually identifying the images with the fewest geometric artifacts to estimate the final geometric errors for calibration. In this paper, we comprehensively and efficiently address the challenging geometric artifacts in SMLCT, , and the corresponding works mainly involve theory, method, and generalization. In particular, after identifying sensitive parameters and conducting some theory analysis of geometric artifacts, we summarize several key properties between sensitive geometric parameters and artifact characteristics. Then, we further construct mathematical relationships that relate sensitive geometric errors to the pixel offsets of reconstruction images with artifact characteristics. To accurately extract pixel bias, we innovatively adapt the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm, commonly used in sound processing, for our image registration task for each paired symmetric LCT. This adaptation leads to the design of a highly efficient rigid translation registration method. Simulation and physical experiments have validated the excellent performance of this work. Additionally, our results demonstrate significant generalization to common rotated CT and a variant of SMLCT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Visibility-Aware Trajectory Planning for Target Tracking in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06363v2)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target tracking has numerous significant civilian and military applications, and maintaining the visibility of the target plays a vital role in ensuring the success of the tracking task. Existing visibility-aware planners primarily focus on keeping the target within the limited field of view of an onboard sensor and avoiding obstacle occlusion. However, the negative impact of system uncertainty is often neglected, rendering the planners delicate to uncertainties in practice. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a real-time, non-myopic trajectory planner for visibility-aware and safe target tracking in the presence of system uncertainty. For more accurate target motion prediction, we introduce the concept of belief-space probability of detection (BPOD) to measure the predictive visibility of the target under stochastic robot and target states. An Extended Kalman Filter variant incorporating BPOD is developed to predict target belief state under uncertain visibility within the planning horizon. To reach real-time trajectory planning, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to uniformly calculate both BPOD and the chance-constrained collision risk by utilizing linearized signed distance function (SDF), and then design a two-stage strategy for lightweight calculation of SDF in sequential convex programming. Extensive simulation results with benchmark comparisons show the capacity of the proposed approach to robustly maintain the visibility of the target under high system uncertainty. The practicality of the proposed trajectory planner is validated by real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report for our conference paper in 2024 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |
| **[Tora: Trajectory-oriented Diffusion Transformer for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21705v2)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in producing high-quality video content. Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap-a gap in generalization at comparable training loss-between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments Using Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional as well as recent data-driven marginal trajectory prediction methods struggle to properly learn non-linear agent-to-agent interactions. We present SSL-Interactions that proposes pretext tasks to enhance interaction modeling for trajectory prediction. We introduce four interaction-aware pretext tasks to encapsulate various aspects of agent interactions: range gap prediction, closest distance prediction, direction of movement prediction, and type of interaction prediction. We further propose an approach to curate interaction-heavy scenarios from datasets. This curated data has two advantages: it provides a stronger learning signal to the interaction model, and facilitates generation of pseudo-labels for interaction-centric pretext tasks. We also propose three new metrics specifically designed to evaluate predictions in interactive scenes. Our empirical evaluations indicate SSL-Interactions outperforms state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods quantitatively with up to 8% improvement, and qualitatively, for interaction-heavy scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IV-2024. 13 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> |  |

Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2024). content may change prior to final publication</p></details> |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a screwdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Differentially Private Spatiotemporal Trajectory Synthesis with Retained Data Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12842v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories collected from GPS-enabled devices are of vital importance to many applications, such as urban planning and traffic analysis. Due to the privacy leakage concerns, many privacy-preserving trajectory publishing methods have been proposed. However, most of them could not strike a good balance between privacy protection and good data utility. In this paper, we propose DP-STTS, a differentially private spatiotemporal trajectory synthesizer with high data utility, which employs a model composed of a start spatiotemporal cube distribution and a 1-order Markov process. Specially, DP-STTS firstly discretizes the raw spatiotemporal trajectories into neighboring cubes, such that the model size is limited and the model's tolerance for noise could be enhanced. Then, a Markov process is utilized for the next location point picking. After adding noise under differential privacy (DP) to the model, synthetic trajectories that preserve essential spatial and temporal characteristics of the real trajectories are generated from the noisy model. Experiments on one real-life dataset demonstrate that DP-STTS provides good data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/Etherious72/DP-STTS.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Minimizing Movement Delay for Movable Antennas via Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12813v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movable antennas (MAs) have received increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability of antenna position adjustment to reconfigure wireless channels. However, moving MAs results in non-negligible delay, which may decrease the effective data transmission time. To reduce the movement delay, we study in this paper a new MA trajectory optimization problem. In particular, given the desired destination positions of multiple MAs, we aim to jointly optimize their associations with the initial MA positions and the trajectories for moving them from their respective initial to destination positions within a given two-dimensional (2D) region, such that the delay of antenna movement is minimized, subject to the inter-MA minimum distance constraints in the movement. However, this problem is a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that sequentially optimizes the MAs' position associations and trajectories, respectively. First, we relax the inter-MA distance constraints and optimally solve the resulted delay minimization problem. Next, we check if the obtained MA association and trajectory solutions satisfy the inter-MA distance constraints. If not satisfied, we then employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to adjust the MAs' trajectories until they satisfy the given constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory optimization method in reducing the movement delay as well as draw useful insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,6 figures, submit to GLOBECOM 2024 Workshop - IRAFWCC</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |

To be as efficient as human surveyors, robotic systems must continuously collect observational data required to complete their survey task. Inspection personnel instinctively know to look at relevant equipment that happens to be ``along the way.'' In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for continuous long-horizon viewpoint planning, for ground robots, applied to tasks involving patrolling, monitoring or visual data gathering in known environments. Our approach to Long Horizon Viewpoint Planning (LHVP), enables the robot to autonomously navigate and collect environmental data optimizing for coverage over the horizon of the patrol. Leveraging a quadruped's mobility and sensory capabilities, our LHVP framework plans patrol paths that account for coupling the viewpoint planner for the arm camera with the mobile base's navigation planner. The viewpath optimization algorithm seeks a balance between comprehensive environmental coverage and dynamically feasible movements, thus ensuring prolonged and effective operation in scenarios including monitoring, security surveillance, and disaster response. We validate our approach through simulations and in the real world and show that our LHVP significantly outperforms naive patrolling methods in terms of area coverage generating information-gathering trajectories for the robot arm. Our results indicate a promising direction for the deployment of mobile robots in long-term, autonomous surveying, and environmental data collection tasks, highlighting the potential of intelligent robotic systems in challenging real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |

A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Traditional automated driving systems recalculate the entire trajectory in a changing environment. Instead, a novel approach retains valid trajectory segments, minimizing the need for complete replanning and reducing changes to the original plan. This work introduces a trajectory repairing framework that calculates a feasible evasive trajectory while computing the Feasible Time-to-React (F-TTR), balancing the maintenance of the original plan with safety assurance. The framework employs a binary search algorithm to iteratively create repaired trajectories, guaranteeing both the safety and feasibility of the trajectory repairing result. In contrast to earlier approaches that separated the calculation of safety metrics from trajectory repairing, which resulted in unsuccessful plans for evasive maneuvers, our work has the anytime capability to provide both a Feasible Time-to-React and an evasive trajectory for further execution.</p></details> |  |

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted for the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |

A particularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks that degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper investigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The proposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals, exploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and symmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these attacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform, highlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and resilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats. Furthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state monitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a carefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect the presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer from biases, such as length of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different elements that are used to compute the proposed metrics.</p></details> |  |

This novel method allows users to effortlessly guide image generation via mouse trajectories. To achieve precise control, we design a distance awareness energy function to effectively guide latent variables, ensuring that the focus of generation is within the areas defined by the trajectory. The energy function encompasses a control function to draw the generation closer to the specified trajectory and a movement function to diminish activity in areas distant from the trajectory. Through extensive experiments and qualitative assessments on the COCO dataset, the results reveal that TraDiffusion facilitates simpler, more natural image control. Moreover, it showcases the ability to manipulate salient regions, attributes, and relationships within the generated images, alongside visual input based on arbitrary or enhanced trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code: https://github.com/och-mac/TraDiffusion</p></details> |

The low-dimensional signals that capture internal brain states are useful for building brain machine interfaces and understanding the neural computation underlying meaningful behavior. We derive a practical upper bound to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inferred neural latent trajectories using Fisher information. We show that the SNR bound is proportional to the overdispersion factor and the Fisher information per neuron. Further numerical experiments show that inference methods that exploit the temporal regularities can achieve higher SNRs that are proportional to the bound. Our results provide insights for fitting models to data, simulating neural responses, and design of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is accepted for publication in the 2024 European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)</p></details> |

Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</p></details> |  |

Thus, early detection of traffic incidents is crucial for road users from safety perspectives with a potential to reduce the risk of secondary crashes. The wide availability of GPS devices now-a-days gives an opportunity of tracking and recording vehicle trajectories. The objective of this study is to use vehicle trajectory data for advance real-time detection of traffic incidents on highways using machine learning-based algorithms. The study uses three days of unevenly sequenced vehicle trajectory data and traffic incident data on I-10, one of the most crash-prone highways in Louisiana. Vehicle trajectories are converted to trajectories based on virtual detector locations to maintain spatial uniformity as well as to generate historical traffic data for machine learning algorithms. Trips matched with traffic incidents on the way are separated and along with other trips with similar spatial attributes are used to build a database for modeling. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Artificial Neural Network models are used to detect a trajectory that is likely to face an incident in the downstream road section. Results suggest that the Random Forest model achieves the best performance for predicting an incident with reasonable recall value and discrimination capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 4 Tables, 10 Figures</p></details> |

It is a fundamental problem in modern applications and the objects considered may be as diverse as locations in space, text documents, images, twitter messages, or trajectories of moving objects. In this paper we are motivated by the latter application. Trajectories are recorded movements of mobile objects such as vehicles, animals, public transportation, or parts of the human body. We propose a novel distance function called DistanceAvg to capture the similarity of such movements. To be practical, it is necessary to provide indexing for this distance measure. Fortunately we do not need to start from scratch. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Our function DistanceAvg is a metric. Although metric indexes have been studied for decades and many such structures are available, they do not offer the best performance with trajectories. In this paper we propose a new design, which outperforms the best existing indexes for kNN queries and is equally good for range queries. It is especially suitable for expensive distance functions as they occur in trajectory similarity search. In many applications, kNN queries are more practical than range queries as it may be difficult to determine an appropriate search radius. Our index provides exact result sets for the given distance function.</p></details> | 54 pages, 26 figures |

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, the current analysis of GNN generalization relies on the assumption that training and testing data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). This imposes limitations on the cases where a model mismatch exists when generating testing data. In this paper, we examine GNNs that operate on geometric graphs generated from manifold models, explicitly focusing on scenarios where there is a mismatch between manifold models generating training and testing data. Our analysis reveals the robustness of the GNN generalization in the presence of such model mismatch. This indicates that GNNs trained on graphs generated from a manifold can still generalize well to unseen nodes and graphs generated from a mismatched manifold. We attribute this mismatch to both node feature perturbations and edge perturbations within the generated graph. Our findings indicate that the generalization gap decreases as the number of nodes grows in the training graph while increasing with larger manifold dimension as well as larger mismatch. Importantly, we observe a trade-off between the generalization of GNNs and the capability to discriminate high-frequency components when facing a model mismatch. The most important practical consequence of this analysis is to shed light on the filter design of generalizable GNNs robust to model mismatch. We verify our theoretical findings with experiments on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.05225</p></details> |

GNNs combine information from adjacent nodes by successive applications of graph convolutions. GNNs have been implemented successfully in various learning tasks while the theoretical understanding of their generalization capability is still in progress. In this paper, we leverage manifold theory to analyze the statistical generalization gap of GNNs operating on graphs constructed on sampled points from manifolds. We study the generalization gaps of GNNs on both node-level and graph-level tasks. We show that the generalization gaps decrease with the number of nodes in the training graphs, which guarantees the generalization of GNNs to unseen points over manifolds. We validate our theoretical results in multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> | 34 pages,22 figures |

Within the realm of referral and targeted marketing, influencer detection stands out as an area that could greatly benefit from the incorporation of dynamic network representation due to the continuous evolution of customer-brand relationships. In this paper, we present INFLECT-DGNN, a new method for profit-driven INFLuencer prEdiCTion with Dynamic Graph Neural Networks that innovatively combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with weighted loss functions, synthetic minority oversampling adapted to graph data, and a carefully crafted rolling-window strategy. We introduce a novel profit-driven framework that supports decision-making based on model predictions. To test the framework, we use a unique corporate dataset with diverse networks, capturing the customer interactions across three cities with different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Our results show how using RNNs to encode temporal attributes alongside GNNs significantly improves predictive performance, while the profit-driven framework determines the optimal classification threshold for profit maximization. We compare the results of different models to demonstrate the importance of capturing network representation, temporal dependencies, and using a profit-driven evaluation. Our research has significant implications for the fields of referral and targeted marketing, expanding the technical use of deep graph learning within corporate environments.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |

However, in the quest for more effective image representations, we turn to hyperbolic manifolds. They provide a compelling alternative to capture complex hierarchical relationships in images with remarkably small dimensionality. To demonstrate hyperbolic embeddings' competence, we introduce a light-weight hyperbolic graph neural network for image segmentation, encompassing patch-level features in a very small embedding size. Our solution, Seg-HGNN, surpasses the current best unsupervised method by 2.5\%, 4\% on VOC-07, VOC-12 for localization, and by 0.8\%, 1.3\% on CUB-200, ECSSD for segmentation, respectively. With less than 7.5k trainable parameters, Seg-HGNN delivers effective and fast ($\approx 2$ images/second) results on very standard GPUs like the GTX1650. This empirical evaluation presents compelling evidence of the efficacy and potential of hyperbolic representations for vision tasks.</p></details> | BMVC 2024 |
| **[Learn2Aggregate: Supervised Generation of Chvátal-Gomory Cuts Using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06559v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present $\textit{Learn2Aggregate}$, a machine learning (ML) framework for optimizing the generation of Chv\'atal-Gomory (CG) cuts in mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The framework trains a graph neural network to classify useful constraints for aggregation in CG cut generation. The ML-driven CG separator selectively focuses on a small set of impactful constraints, improving runtimes without compromising the strength of the generated cuts. Key to our approach is the formulation of a constraint classification task which favours sparse aggregation of constraints, consistent with empirical findings. This, in conjunction with a careful constraint labeling scheme and a hybrid of deep learning and feature engineering, results in enhanced CG cut generation across five diverse MILP benchmarks. On the largest test sets, our method closes roughly $\textit{twice}$ as much of the integrality gap as the standard CG method while running 40$% faster. This performance improvement is due to our method eliminating 75% of the constraints prior to aggregation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Neural Laplacian Operator for 3D Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06506v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discrete Laplacian operator holds a crucial role in 3D geometry processing, yet it is still challenging to define it on point clouds. Previous works mainly focused on constructing a local triangulation around each point to approximate the underlying manifold for defining the Laplacian operator, which may not be robust or accurate. In contrast, we simply use the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) graph constructed from the input point cloud and learn the Laplacian operator on the KNN graph with graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the ground-truth Laplacian operator is defined on a manifold mesh with a different connectivity from the KNN graph and thus cannot be directly used for training. To train the GNN, we propose a novel training scheme by imitating the behavior of the ground-truth Laplacian operator on a set of probe functions so that the learned Laplacian operator behaves similarly to the ground-truth Laplacian operator. We train our network on a subset of ShapeNet and evaluate it across a variety of point clouds. Compared with previous methods, our method reduces the error by an order of magnitude and excels in handling sparse point clouds with thin structures or sharp features. Our method also demonstrates a strong generalization ability to unseen shapes. With our learned Laplacian operator, we further apply a series of Laplacian-based geometry processing algorithms directly to point clouds and achieve accurate results, enabling many exciting possibilities for geometry processing on point clouds.

| **[Relational Prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08263v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social Event Detection (SED) aims to identify significant events from social streams, and has a wide application ranging from public opinion analysis to risk management. In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, GNN-based methods often struggle with missing and noisy edges between messages, affecting the quality of learned message embedding. Moreover, these methods statically initialize node embedding before training, which, in turn, limits the ability to learn from message texts and relations simultaneously. In this paper, we approach social event detection from a new perspective based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and present RPLM_SED (Relational prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection). We first propose a new pairwise message modeling strategy to construct social messages into message pairs with multi-relational sequences. Secondly, a new multi-relational prompt-based pairwise message learning mechanism is proposed to learn more comprehensive message representation from message pairs with multi-relational prompts using PLMs. Thirdly, we design a new clustering constraint to optimize the encoding process by enhancing intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster dispersion, making the message representation more distinguishable. We evaluate the RPLM_SED on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the RPLM_SED model achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline, online, low-resource, and long-tail distribution scenarios for social event detection tasks.</p></details> | ACM TOIS |
| **[LAMP: Learnable Meta-Path Guided Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06323v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have significantly propelled the information retrieval (IR) field. Still, the effectiveness of HGNNs heavily relies on high-quality labels, which are often expensive to acquire. This challenge has shifted attention towards Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which usually requires pre-defined meta-paths. However, our findings reveal that meta-path combinations significantly affect performance in unsupervised settings, an aspect often overlooked in current literature. Existing HGCL methods have considerable variability in outcomes across different meta-path combinations, thereby challenging the optimization process to achieve consistent and high performance. In response, we introduce \textsf{LAMP} (\underline{\textbf{L}}earn\underline{\textbf{A}}ble \underline{\textbf{M}}eta-\underline{\textbf{P}}ath), a novel adversarial contrastive learning approach that integrates various meta-path sub-graphs into a unified and stable structure, leveraging the overlap among these sub-graphs. To address the denseness of this integrated sub-graph, we propose an adversarial training strategy for edge pruning, maintaining sparsity to enhance model performance and robustness. \textsf{LAMP} aims to maximize the difference between meta-path and network schema views for guiding contrastive learning to capture the most meaningful information. Our extensive experimental study conducted on four diverse datasets from the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB) demonstrates that \textsf{LAMP} significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised models in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Our approach is robust to the underlying graph topology and is fully differentiable, making it possible to find solutions that jointly optimize the MAXCUT along with other objectives. Based on the obtained MAXCUT partition, we implement a hierarchical graph pooling layer for Graph Neural Networks, which is sparse, differentiable, and particularly suitable for downstream tasks on heterophilic graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrofitting Temporal Graph Neural Networks with Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05477v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) outperform regular GNNs by incorporating time information into graph-based operations. However, TGNNs adopt specialized models (e.g., TGN, TGAT, and APAN ) and require tailored training frameworks (e.g., TGL and ETC). In this paper, we propose TF-TGN, which uses Transformer decoder as the backbone model for TGNN to enjoy Transformer's codebase for efficient training. In particular, Transformer achieves tremendous success for language modeling, and thus the community developed high-performance kernels (e.g., flash-attention and memory-efficient attention) and efficient distributed training schemes (e.g., PyTorch FSDP, DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM). We observe that TGNN resembles language modeling, i.e., the message aggregation operation between chronologically occurring nodes and their temporal neighbors in TGNNs can be structured as sequence modeling. Beside this similarity, we also incorporate a series of algorithm designs including suffix infilling, temporal graph attention with self-loop, and causal masking self-attention to make TF-TGN work. During training, existing systems are slow in transforming the graph topology and conducting graph sampling. As such, we propose methods to parallelize the CSR format conversion and graph sampling. We also adapt Transformer codebase to train TF-TGN efficiently with multiple GPUs. We experiment with 9 graphs and compare with 2 state-of-the-art TGNN training frameworks. The results show that TF-TGN can accelerate training by over 2.20 while providing comparable or even superior accuracy to existing SOTA TGNNs.

| **[Scalable Multitask Learning Using Gradient-based Estimation of Task Affinity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06091v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning. Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks. Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive. We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training. The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination. The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination. We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models. Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters. We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models. Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training. On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours. Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 16 pages |

| **[Higher Order Structures For Graph Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03253v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning representations of graph-structured data, demonstrating remarkable performance across various tasks. Recognising their importance, there has been extensive research focused on explaining GNN predictions, aiming to enhance their interpretability and trustworthiness. However, GNNs and their explainers face a notable challenge: graphs are primarily designed to model pair-wise relationships between nodes, which can make it tough to capture higher-order, multi-node interactions. This characteristic can pose difficulties for existing explainers in fully representing multi-node relationships. To address this gap, we present Framework For Higher-Order Representations In Graph Explanations (FORGE), a framework that enables graph explainers to capture such interactions by incorporating higher-order structures, resulting in more accurate and faithful explanations. Extensive evaluation shows that on average real-world datasets from the GraphXAI benchmark and synthetic datasets across various graph explainers, FORGE improves average explanation accuracy by 1.9x and 2.25x, respectively. We perform ablation studies to confirm the importance of higher-order relations in improving explanations, while our scalability analysis demonstrates FORGE's efficacy on large graphs.</p></details> |  |

Evaluation Pitfalls and New Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05755v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on machine learning tasks with relational data. However, recent studies have found that heterophily can cause significant performance degradation of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks. Numerous heterophilic benchmark datasets have been put forward to validate the efficacy of heterophily-specific GNNs and various homophily metrics have been designed to help people recognize these malignant datasets. Nevertheless, there still exist multiple pitfalls that severely hinder the proper evaluation of new models and metrics. In this paper, we point out three most serious pitfalls: 1) a lack of hyperparameter tuning; 2) insufficient model evaluation on the real challenging heterophilic datasets; 3) missing quantitative evaluation benchmark for homophily metrics on synthetic graphs. To overcome these challenges, we first train and fine-tune baseline models on $27$ most widely used benchmark datasets, categorize them into three distinct groups: malignant, benign and ambiguous heterophilic datasets, and identify the real challenging subsets of tasks. To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such taxonomy. Then, we re-evaluate $10$ heterophily-specific state-of-the-arts (SOTA) GNNs with fine-tuned hyperparameters on different groups of heterophilic datasets. Based on the model performance, we reassess their effectiveness on addressing heterophily challenge. At last, we evaluate $11$ popular homophily metrics on synthetic graphs with three different generation approaches. To compare the metrics strictly, we propose the first quantitative evaluation method based on Fr\'echet distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.09618</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering (CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning (CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Model Graph Structural Information on MLPs via Graph Structure Self-Contrasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05573v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed great success in handling graph-related tasks with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNNs are based on message passing to perform feature aggregation and transformation, where the structural information is explicitly involved in the forward propagation by coupling with node features through graph convolution at each layer. As a result, subtle feature noise or structure perturbation may cause severe error propagation, resulting in extremely poor robustness. In this paper, we rethink the roles played by graph structural information in graph data training and identify that message passing is not the only path to modeling structural information. Inspired by this, we propose a simple but effective Graph Structure Self-Contrasting (GSSC) framework that learns graph structural information without message passing. The proposed framework is based purely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), where the structural information is only implicitly incorporated as prior knowledge to guide the computation of supervision signals, substituting the explicit message propagation as in GNNs. Specifically, it first applies structural sparsification to remove potentially uninformative or noisy edges in the neighborhood, and then performs structural self-contrasting in the sparsified neighborhood to learn robust node representations. Finally, structural sparsification and self-contrasting are formulated as a bi-level optimization problem and solved in a unified framework. Extensive experiments have qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated that the GSSC framework can produce truly encouraging performance with better generalization and robustness than other leading competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modeling-papers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</p></details> |  |

However, many PINN-like methods are poorly scalable and are limited to in-sample scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel discrete approach termed Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (PIGNN) to solve forward and inverse nonlinear PDEs. In particular, our approach seamlessly integrates the strength of graph neural networks (GNN), physical equations and finite difference to approximate solutions of physical systems. Our approach is compared with the PINN baseline on three well-known nonlinear PDEs (heat, Burgers and FitzHugh-Nagumo). We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method to work with irregular meshes, longer time steps, arbitrary spatial resolutions, varying initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) by conducting extensive numerical experiments. Numerical results also illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, time extrapolability, generalizability and scalability. The main advantage of our approach is that models trained in small domains with simple settings have excellent fitting capabilities and can be directly applied to more complex situations in large domains.</p></details> |  |

Real-world graphs have imbalanced distribution, such as node labels and degrees, which leaves a critical challenge to GRL. Imbalanced inputs can lead to imbalanced outputs. However, most existing works ignore it and assume that the distribution of input graphs is balanced, which cannot align with real situations, resulting in worse model performance on tail data. The domination of head data makes tail data underrepresented when training graph neural networks (GNNs). Thus, we propose Graffin, a pluggable tail data augmentation module, to address the above issues. Inspired by recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Graffin flows head features into tail data through graph serialization techniques to alleviate the imbalance of tail representation. The local and global structures are fused to form the node representation under the combined effect of neighborhood and sequence information, which enriches the semantics of tail data. We validate the performance of Graffin on four real-world datasets in node classification tasks. Results show that Graffin can improve the adaptation to tail data without significantly degrading the overall model performance.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Forecasting conversation derailment predicts signs of derailment in advance enabling proactive moderation of conversations. State-of-the-art approaches to conversation derailment forecasting sequentially encode conversations and use graph neural networks to model dialogue user dynamics. However, existing graph models are not able to capture complex conversational characteristics such as context propagation and emotional shifts. The use of common sense knowledge enables a model to capture such characteristics, thus improving performance. Following this approach, here we derive commonsense statements from a knowledge base of dialogue contextual information to enrich a graph neural network classification architecture. We fuse the multi-source information on utterance into capsules, which are used by a transformer-based forecaster to predict conversation derailment. Our model captures conversation dynamics and context propagation, outperforming the state-of-the-art models on the CGA and CMV benchmark datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2306.12982; text overlap with arXiv:2106.01071 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Generalization of Geometric Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05191v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the generalization capabilities of geometric graph neural networks (GNNs). We consider GNNs over a geometric graph constructed from a finite set of randomly sampled points over an embedded manifold with topological information captured. We prove a generalization gap between the optimal empirical risk and the optimal statistical risk of this GNN, which decreases with the number of sampled points from the manifold and increases with the dimension of the underlying manifold. This generalization gap ensures that the GNN trained on a graph on a set of sampled points can be utilized to process other unseen graphs constructed from the same underlying manifold. The most important observation is that the generalization capability can be realized with one large graph instead of being limited to the size of the graph as in previous results. The generalization gap is derived based on the non-asymptotic convergence result of a GNN on the sampled graph to the underlying manifold neural networks (MNNs). We verify this theoretical result with experiments on both Arxiv dataset and Cora dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.05225</p></details> |

Radar, with its robustness to adverse weather conditions and capability to measure distances, has drawn significant interest for radar-camera depth estimation. However, existing algorithms process the inherently noisy and sparse radar data by projecting 3D points onto the image plane for pixel-level feature extraction, overlooking the valuable geometric information contained within the radar point cloud. To address this gap, we propose GET-UP, leveraging attention-enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exchange and aggregate both 2D and 3D information from radar data. This approach effectively enriches the feature representation by incorporating spatial relationships compared to traditional methods that rely only on 2D feature extraction. Furthermore, we incorporate a point cloud upsampling task to densify the radar point cloud, rectify point positions, and derive additional 3D features under the guidance of lidar data. Finally, we fuse radar and camera features during the decoding phase for depth estimation. We benchmark our proposed GET-UP on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 15.3% and 14.7% improvement in MAE and RMSE over the previously best-performing model.

| **[Learning polycrystal plasticity using mesh-based subgraph geometric deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05169v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polycrystal plasticity in metals is characterized by nonlinear behavior and strain hardening, making numerical models computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Network (GNN) to surrogate polycrystal plasticity from finite element method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, aggregates them to obtain embeddings, and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. We demonstrate training GNN based on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh-graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. The GNN is trained on 72 graphs and tested on 18 graphs. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals and learn the stress-strain maps based on strain-gradient plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained based on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are 0.993. The proposed GNN plasticity constitutive model speeds up more than 150 times compared with the benchmark FEM method on randomly selected test polycrystals. We also apply the trained GNN to 30 unseen FEM simulations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. Analysis of the von Mises stress distributions in polycrystals shows that the GNN model accurately learns the stress distribution with low error. By comparing the error distribution across training, testing, and unseen datasets, we can deduce that the proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data. This work is expected to pave the way for using graphs as surrogates in polycrystal plasticity modeling.</p></details> | 30 pages, 17 figures |
| **[GEGA: Graph Convolutional Networks and Evidence Retrieval Guided Attention for Enhanced Document-level Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21384v2)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to extract relations between entities from unstructured document text. Compared to sentence-level relation extraction, it requires more complex semantic understanding from a broader text context. Currently, some studies are utilizing logical rules within evidence sentences to enhance the performance of DocRE. However, in the data without provided evidence sentences, researchers often obtain a list of evidence sentences for the entire document through evidence retrieval (ER). Therefore, DocRE suffers from two challenges: firstly, the relevance between evidence and entity pairs is weak; secondly, there is insufficient extraction of complex cross-relations between long-distance multi-entities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GEGA, a novel model for DocRE. The model leverages graph neural networks to construct multiple weight matrices, guiding attention allocation to evidence sentences. It also employs multi-scale representation aggregation to enhance ER. Subsequently, we integrate the most efficient evidence information to implement both fully supervised and weakly supervised training processes for the model. We evaluate the GEGA model on three widely used benchmark datasets: DocRED, Re-DocRED, and Revisit-DocRED. The experimental results indicate that our model has achieved comprehensive improvements compared to the existing SOTA model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Policy-based Directed Hypergraph Learning for Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05037v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods that incorporate graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied for intelligent traffic signal control, which aims to coordinate traffic signals effectively across multiple intersections. Despite this progress, the standard graph learning used in these methods still struggles to capture higher-order correlations in real-world traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization framework DHG-PPO, which incorporates PPO and directed hypergraph module to extract the spatio-temporal attributes of the road networks. DHG-PPO enables multiple agents to ingeniously interact through the dynamical construction of hypergraph. The effectiveness of DHG-PPO is validated in terms of average travel time and throughput against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[BernGraph: Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks for EHR-based Medication Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09410v2)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The medical community believes binary medical event outcomes in EHR data contain sufficient information for making a sensible recommendation. However, there are two challenges to effectively utilizing such data: (1) modeling the relationship between massive 0,1 event outcomes is difficult, even with expert knowledge; (2) in practice, learning can be stalled by the binary values since the equally important 0 entries propagate no learning signals. Currently, there is a large gap between the assumed sufficient information and the reality that no promising results have been shown by utilizing solely the binary data: visiting or secondary information is often necessary to reach acceptable performance. In this paper, we attempt to build the first successful binary EHR data-oriented drug recommendation system by tackling the two difficulties, making sensible drug recommendations solely using the binary EHR medical records. To this end, we take a statistical perspective to view the EHR data as a sample from its cohorts and transform them into continuous Bernoulli probabilities. The transformed entries not only model a deterministic binary event with a distribution but also allow reflecting \emph{event-event} relationship by conditional probability. A graph neural network is learned on top of the transformation. It captures event-event correlations while emphasizing \emph{event-to-patient} features. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale databases, outperforming baseline methods that use secondary information by a large margin.

| **[HopGNN: Boosting Distributed GNN Training Efficiency via Feature-Centric Model Migration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00657v2)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed training of graph neural networks (GNNs) has become a crucial technique for processing large graphs. Prevalent GNN frameworks are model-centric, necessitating the transfer of massive graph vertex features to GNN models, which leads to a significant communication bottleneck. Recognizing that the model size is often significantly smaller than the feature size, we propose LeapGNN, a feature-centric framework that reverses this paradigm by bringing GNN models to vertex features. To make it truly effective, we first propose a micrograph-based training strategy that trains the model using a refined structure with superior locality to reduce remote feature retrieval. Then, we devise a feature pre-gathering approach that merges multiple fetch operations into a single one to eliminate redundant feature transmissions. Finally, we employ a micrograph-based merging method that adjusts the number of micrographs for each worker to minimize kernel switches and synchronization overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate that LeapGNN achieves a performance speedup of up to 4.2x compared to the state-of-the-art method, namely P3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Convolutional Neural Networks Sensitivity under Probabilistic Error Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07831v5)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs), have emerged as pivotal instruments in machine learning and signal processing for processing graph-structured data. This paper proposes an analysis framework to investigate the sensitivity of GCNNs to probabilistic graph perturbations, directly impacting the graph shift operator (GSO). Our study establishes tight expected GSO error bounds, which are explicitly linked to the error model parameters, and reveals a linear relationship between GSO perturbations and the resulting output differences at each layer of GCNNs. This linearity demonstrates that a single-layer GCNN maintains stability under graph edge perturbations, provided that the GSO errors remain bounded, regardless of the perturbation scale. For multilayer GCNNs, the dependency of system's output difference on GSO perturbations is shown to be a recursion of linearity. Finally, we exemplify the framework with the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) and Simple Graph Convolution Network (SGCN). Experiments validate our theoretical derivations and the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Genetic Algorithms with Neural Cost Predictor for Solving Hierarchical Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14157v4)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When vehicle routing decisions are intertwined with higher-level decisions, the resulting optimization problems pose significant challenges for computation. Examples are the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), where customers are assigned to depots before delivery, and the capacitated location routing problem (CLRP), where the locations of depots should be determined first. A simple and straightforward approach for such hierarchical problems would be to separate the higher-level decisions from the complicated vehicle routing decisions. For each higher-level decision candidate, we may evaluate the underlying vehicle routing problems to assess the candidate. As this approach requires solving vehicle routing problems multiple times, it has been regarded as impractical in most cases. We propose a novel deep-learning-based approach called Genetic Algorithm with Neural Cost Predictor (GANCP) to tackle the challenge and simplify algorithm developments. For each higher-level decision candidate, we predict the objective function values of the underlying vehicle routing problems using a pre-trained graph neural network without actually solving the routing problems. In particular, our proposed neural network learns the objective values of the HGS-CVRP open-source package that solves capacitated vehicle routing problems. Our numerical experiments show that this simplified approach is effective and efficient in generating high-quality solutions for both MDVRP and CLRP and has the potential to expedite algorithm developments for complicated hierarchical problems. We provide computational results evaluated in the standard benchmark instances used in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Content Augmented Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12741v2)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool for solving various problems over graphs. In these models, the link structure of the graph is typically exploited and nodes' embeddings are iteratively updated based on adjacent nodes. Nodes' contents are used solely in the form of feature vectors, served as nodes' first-layer embeddings. However, the filters or convolutions, applied during iterations/layers to these initial embeddings lead to their impact diminish and contribute insignificantly to the final embeddings. In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose augmenting nodes' embeddings by embeddings generated from their content, at higher GNN layers. More precisely, we propose models wherein a structural embedding using a GNN and a content embedding are computed for each node. These two are combined using a combination layer to form the embedding of a node at a given layer layer. We suggest methods such as using an auto-encoder or building a content graph, to generate content embeddings. In the end, by conducting experiments over several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the high accuracy and performance of our models.</p></details> |  |

The FEM solvers frequently suffer from intensive computation cost and high running time. Recent graph neural network (GNN)-based simulation models can improve running time meanwhile with acceptable accuracy. Unfortunately, they are hard to tailor GNNs for complex mechanical systems, including such disadvantages as ineffective representation and inefficient message propagation (MP). To tackle these issues, in this paper, with the proposed Up-sampling-only and Adaptive MP techniques, we develop a novel hierarchical Mesh Graph Network, namely UA-MGN, for efficient and effective mechanical simulation. Evaluation on two synthetic and one real datasets demonstrates the superiority of the UA-MGN. For example, on the Beam dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art MS-MGN, UA-MGN leads to 40.99% lower errors but using only 43.48% fewer network parameters and 4.49% fewer floating point operations (FLOPs).</p></details> |  |

Frequent use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based methodologies by researchers has resulted in significant advancements in the last decade. These techniques led to notable performance enhancements in different tasks such as protein structure prediction, drug-target binding affinity prediction, and molecular property prediction. In material science literature, it is well-known that crystalline materials exhibit topological structures. Such topological structures may be represented as graphs and utilization of graph neural network (GNN) based approaches could help encoding them into an augmented representation space. Primarily, such frameworks adopt supervised learning techniques targeted towards downstream property prediction tasks on the basis of electronic properties (formation energy, bandgap, total energy, etc.) and crystalline structures. Generally, such type of frameworks rely highly on the handcrafted atom feature representations along with the structural representations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised framework namely, CrysAtom, using untagged crystal data to generate dense vector representation of atoms, which can be utilized in existing GNN-based property predictor models to accurately predict important properties of crystals. Empirical results show that our dense representation embeds chemical properties of atoms and enhance the performance of the baseline property predictor models significantly.</p></details> |  |

While adhering to an assigned travel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring stochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of exceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to enormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that with the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve complex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of collected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of generalizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

| **[Detection of False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) on Power Dynamical Systems With a State Prediction Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04609v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the deeper penetration of inverter-based resources in power systems, false data injection attacks (FDIA) are a growing cyber-security concern. They have the potential to disrupt the system's stability like frequency stability, thereby leading to catastrophic failures. Therefore, an FDIA detection method would be valuable to protect power systems. FDIAs typically induce a discrepancy between the desired and the effective behavior of the power system dynamics. A suitable detection method can leverage power dynamics predictions to identify whether such a discrepancy was induced by an FDIA. This work investigates the efficacy of temporal and spatio-temporal state prediction models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with LSTM, for predicting frequency dynamics in the absence of an FDIA but with noisy measurements, and thereby identify FDIA events. For demonstration purposes, the IEEE 39 New England Kron-reduced model simulated with a swing equation is considered. It is shown that the proposed state prediction models can be used as a building block for developing an effective FDIA detection method that can maintain high detection accuracy across various attack and deployment settings. It is also shown how the FDIA detection should be deployed to limit its exposure to detection inaccuracies and mitigate its computational burden.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Cooperative Minibatching in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12403v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) requires significant computational resources, and the process is highly data-intensive. One of the most effective ways to reduce resource requirements is minibatch training coupled with graph sampling. GNNs have the unique property that items in a minibatch have overlapping data. However, the commonly implemented Independent Minibatching approach assigns each Processing Element (PE, i.e., cores and/or GPUs) its own minibatch to process, leading to duplicated computations and input data access across PEs. This amplifies the Neighborhood Explosion Phenomenon (NEP), which is the main bottleneck limiting scaling. To reduce the effects of NEP in the multi-PE setting, we propose a new approach called Cooperative Minibatching. Our approach capitalizes on the fact that the size of the sampled subgraph is a concave function of the batch size, leading to significant reductions in the amount of work as batch sizes increase. Hence, it is favorable for processors equipped with a fast interconnect to work on a large minibatch together as a single larger processor, instead of working on separate smaller minibatches, even though global batch size is identical. We also show how to take advantage of the same phenomenon in serial execution by generating dependent consecutive minibatches. Our experimental evaluations show up to 4x bandwidth savings for fetching vertex embeddings, by simply increasing this dependency without harming model convergence. Combining our proposed approaches, we achieve up to 64% speedup over Independent Minibatching on single-node multi-GPU systems, using same resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission.

However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. A simpler recently proposed approach to accelerate training is to use Adam for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, nowcast (predict future) parameters. We improve this approach by Neuron interaction and Nowcasting (NiNo) networks. NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters by learning in a supervised way from a set of training trajectories over multiple tasks. We show that in some networks, such as Transformers, neuron connectivity is non-trivial. By accurately modeling neuron connectivity, we allow NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50\% in vision and language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/nino</p></details> |

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Model. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with four different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 8B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUQ-GNN: Committee-based Graph Uncertainty Quantification using Posterior Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04159v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the influence of domain-specific characteristics when defining a meaningful notion of predictive uncertainty on graph data. Previously, the so-called Graph Posterior Network (GPN) model has been proposed to quantify uncertainty in node classification tasks. Given a graph, it uses Normalizing Flows (NFs) to estimate class densities for each node independently and converts those densities into Dirichlet pseudo-counts, which are then dispersed through the graph using the personalized Page-Rank algorithm. The architecture of GPNs is motivated by a set of three axioms on the properties of its uncertainty estimates. We show that those axioms are not always satisfied in practice and therefore propose the family of Committe-based Uncertainty Quantification Graph Neural Networks (CUQ-GNNs), which combine standard Graph Neural Networks with the NF-based uncertainty estimation of Posterior Networks (PostNets). This approach adapts more flexibly to domain-specific demands on the properties of uncertainty estimates. We compare CUQ-GNN against GPN and other uncertainty quantification approaches on common node classification benchmarks and show that it is effective at producing useful uncertainty estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning method tailored to solve large-scale urban FLP, capable of producing near-optimal solutions at superfast inference speed. We distill the essential swap operation from local search, and simulate it by intelligently selecting edges on a graph of urban regions, guided by a knowledge-informed graph neural network, thus sidestepping the need for heavy computation of local search. Extensive experiments on four US cities with different geospatial conditions demonstrate that our approach can achieve comparable performance to commercial solvers with less than 5\% accessibility loss, while displaying up to 1000 times speedup. We deploy our model as an online geospatial application at https://huggingface.co/spaces/randommmm/MFLP.</p></details> | Sigspatial2024 |
| **[PAGE: Parametric Generative Explainer for Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14042v2)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces PAGE, a parameterized generative interpretive framework. PAGE is capable of providing faithful explanations for any graph neural network without necessitating prior knowledge or internal details. Specifically, we train the auto-encoder to generate explanatory substructures by designing appropriate training strategy. Due to the dimensionality reduction of features in the latent space of the auto-encoder, it becomes easier to extract causal features leading to the model's output, which can be easily employed to generate explanations. To accomplish this, we introduce an additional discriminator to capture the causality between latent causal features and the model's output. By designing appropriate optimization objectives, the well-trained discriminator can be employed to constrain the encoder in generating enhanced causal features. Finally, these features are mapped to substructures of the input graph through the decoder to serve as explanations. Compared to existing methods, PAGE operates at the sample scale rather than nodes or edges, eliminating the need for perturbation or encoding processes as seen in previous methods. Experimental results on both artificially synthesized and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only exhibits the highest faithfulness and accuracy but also significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Graph Pooling for Explainable Classification of Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11133v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a commonly used technique to measure neural activation. Its application has been particularly important in identifying underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Autism. Recent analysis of fMRI data models the brain as a graph and extracts features by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the unique characteristics of fMRI data require a special design of GNN. Tailoring GNN to generate effective and domain-explainable features remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive dual-attention block and a differentiable graph pooling method called ContrastPool to better utilize GNN for brain networks, meeting fMRI-specific requirements. We apply our method to 5 resting-state fMRI brain network datasets of 3 diseases and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Our case study confirms that the patterns extracted by our method match the domain knowledge in neuroscience literature, and disclose direct and interesting insights. Our contributions underscore the potential of ContrastPool for advancing the understanding of brain networks and neurodegenerative conditions.

| **[PowerFlowMultiNet: Multigraph Neural Networks for Unbalanced Three-Phase Distribution Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00892v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently solving unbalanced three-phase power flow in distribution grids is pivotal for grid analysis and simulation. There is a pressing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling large-scale unbalanced power grids that can provide accurate and fast solutions. To address this, deep learning techniques, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged. However, existing literature primarily focuses on balanced networks, leaving a critical gap in supporting unbalanced three-phase power grids. This letter introduces PowerFlowMultiNet, a novel multigraph GNN framework explicitly designed for unbalanced three-phase power grids. The proposed approach models each phase separately in a multigraph representation, effectively capturing the inherent asymmetry in unbalanced grids. A graph embedding mechanism utilizing message passing is introduced to capture spatial dependencies within the power system network. PowerFlowMultiNet outperforms traditional methods and other deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy and computational speed. Rigorous testing reveals significantly lower error rates and a notable hundredfold increase in computational speed for large power networks compared to model-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph-based Adversarial Imitation Learning Framework for Reliable & Realtime Fleet Scheduling in Urban Air Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12113v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) presents the scope for a transformative shift in the domain of urban transportation. However, its widespread adoption and economic viability depends in part on the ability to optimally schedule the fleet of aircraft across vertiports in a UAM network, under uncertainties attributed to airspace congestion, changing weather conditions, and varying demands. This paper presents a comprehensive optimization formulation of the fleet scheduling problem, while also identifying the need for alternate solution approaches, since directly solving the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem is computationally prohibitive for daily fleet scheduling. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of using (graph) reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to train real-time executable policy models for fleet scheduling. However, such policies can often be brittle on out-of-distribution scenarios or edge cases. Moreover, training performance also deteriorates as the complexity (e.g., number of constraints) of the problem increases. To address these issues, this paper presents an imitation learning approach where the RL-based policy exploits expert demonstrations yielded by solving the exact optimization using a Genetic Algorithm. The policy model comprises Graph Neural Network (GNN) based encoders that embed the space of vertiports and aircraft, Transformer networks to encode demand, passenger fare, and transport cost profiles, and a Multi-head attention (MHA) based decoder. Expert demonstrations are used through the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. Interfaced with a UAM simulation environment involving 8 vertiports and 40 aircrafts, in terms of the daily profits earned reward, the new imitative approach achieves better mean performance and remarkable improvement in the case of unseen worst-case scenarios, compared to pure RL results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the AIAA Aviation Forum 2024</p></details> |
| **[Large Scale Training of Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Markov-Chain Partitioning Using the Kemeny Constant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14847v3)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle to capture the complex relationships within graphs and generalise to arbitrary clustering criteria. The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a powerful framework for learning representations of graph data provides new approaches to solving the problem. Previous work has shown GNNs to be capable of proposing partitionings using a variety of criteria, however, these approaches have not yet been extended to work on Markov chains or kinetic networks. These arise frequently in the study of molecular systems and are of particular interest to the biochemical modelling community. In this work, we propose several GNN-based architectures to tackle the graph partitioning problem for Markov Chains described as kinetic networks. This approach aims to minimize how much a proposed partitioning changes the Kemeny constant. We propose using an encoder-decoder architecture and show how simple GraphSAGE-based GNNs with linear layers can outperform much larger and more expressive attention-based models in this context. As a proof of concept, we first demonstrate the method's ability to cluster randomly connected graphs. We also use a linear chain architecture corresponding to a 1D free energy profile as our kinetic network. Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on a data set derived from molecular dynamics. We compare the performance of our method to other partitioning techniques such as PCCA+. We explore the importance of feature and hyperparameter selection and propose a general strategy for large-scale parallel training of GNNs for discovering optimal graph partitionings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Massive Activations of Attention Mechanism in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03463v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for effectively modeling data with graph structures. Recently, attention mechanisms have been integrated into GNNs to improve their ability to capture complex patterns. This paper presents the first comprehensive study revealing a critical, unexplored consequence of this integration: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. We introduce a novel method for detecting and analyzing MAs, focusing on edge features in different graph transformer architectures. Our study assesses various GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs based on activation ratio distributions, (3) introducing the Explicit Bias Term (EBT) as a potential countermeasure and exploring it as an adversarial framework to assess models robustness based on the presence or absence of MAs. Our findings highlight the prevalence and impact of attention-induced MAs across different architectures, such as GraphTransformer, GraphiT, and SAN. The study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, model architecture, dataset characteristics, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for developing more robust and reliable graph models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Graph Neural Networks with Limited Labeled Data by Actively Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13989v3)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are pervasive in the real-world, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have great ability in node classification, a fundamental task on graphs. Unfortunately, conventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes, despite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer learning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to exploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based methods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the quality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm to enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with considerably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 Figures |

The model extends the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System by introducing a stretched-grid architecture that dedicates higher resolution over a regional area of interest and maintains a lower resolution elsewhere on the globe. The model is based on graph neural networks, which naturally affords arbitrary multi-resolution grid configurations. The model is applied to short-range weather prediction for the Nordics, producing forecasts at 2.5 km spatial and 6 h temporal resolution. The model is pre-trained on 43 years of global ERA5 data at 31 km resolution and is further refined using 3.3 years of 2.5 km resolution operational analyses from the MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS). The performance of the model is evaluated using surface observations from measurement stations across Norway and is compared to short-range weather forecasts from MEPS. The DDM outperforms both the control run and the ensemble mean of MEPS for 2 m temperature. The model also produces competitive precipitation and wind speed forecasts, but is shown to underestimate extreme events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Oriented Communication for Graph Data: A Graph Information Bottleneck Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02728v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data, essential in fields like knowledge representation and social networks, often involves large networks with many nodes and edges. Transmitting these graphs can be highly inefficient due to their size and redundancy for specific tasks. This paper introduces a method to extract a smaller, task-focused subgraph that maintains key information while reducing communication overhead. Our approach utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) and the graph information bottleneck (GIB) principle to create a compact, informative, and robust graph representation suitable for transmission. The challenge lies in the irregular structure of graph data, making GIB optimization complex. We address this by deriving a tractable variational upper bound for the objective function. Additionally, we propose the VQ-GIB mechanism, integrating vector quantization (VQ) to convert subgraph representations into a discrete codebook sequence, compatible with existing digital communication systems. Our experiments show that this GIB-based method significantly lowers communication costs while preserving essential task-related information. The approach demonstrates robust performance across various communication channels, suitable for both continuous and discrete systems.</p></details> |  |

Among different methods, graph neural networks have achieved so far the most promising results, learning relations between graph nodes then becomes a crucial task. However, improvement space is very limited when these relations are learned in a node-to-node manner. The challenge stems from (1) obscure temporal dependencies between different stations, (2) difficulties in defining variables beyond the node level, and (3) no ready-made method to validate the learned relations. To confront these challenges, we define legitimate traffic causal variables to discover the causal relation inside the traffic network, which is carefully checked with statistic tools and case analysis. We then present a novel model named Graph Spatial-Temporal Network Based on Causal Insight (GT-CausIn), where prior learned causal information is integrated with graph diffusion layers and temporal convolutional network (TCN) layers. Experiments are carried out on two real-world traffic datasets: PEMS-BAY and METR-LA, which show that GT-CausIn significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on mid-term and long-term prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing works usually incorporate graph knowledge with conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), leading to the text and graph knowledge encoding processes being separated in a serial pipeline. We argue that these separate representation learning stages may be suboptimal for neural networks to learn the overall context contained in both types of input knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware graph-attention model (Context-aware GAT), which can effectively incorporate global features of relevant knowledge graphs based on a context-enhanced knowledge aggregation process. Specifically, our framework leverages a novel representation learning approach to process heterogeneous features - combining flattened graph knowledge with text. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at hierarchically applying graph knowledge aggregation on a connected subgraph in addition to contextual information to support commonsense dialogue generation. This framework shows superior performance compared to conventional GNN-based language frameworks. Both automatic and human evaluation demonstrates that our proposed model has significant performance uplifts over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INLG 2024</p></details> |

This classification not only supports educational diagnostics and analytics but also enhances complex tasks like information retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in natural language, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs), named Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN) to better model the inherent structure of questions. By representing questions as graphs -- where nodes signify words or phrases and edges denote syntactic or semantic relationships -- our method allows GCNs to learn from the interconnected nature of language more effectively. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of phrase-based features to enhance classification accuracy, especially in low-resource settings. Our findings demonstrate that GCNs, augmented with these features, offer a promising solution for more accurate and context-aware question classification, bridging the gap between graph neural network research and practical educational applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[NFARec: A Negative Feedback-Aware Recommender Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06900v3)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN)-based models have been extensively studied for recommendations, as they can extract high-order collaborative signals accurately which is required for high-quality recommender systems. However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating. In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback. To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations. Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process. The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines.

Recent work on graph neural networks (GNNs) or debiasing methods has attained remarkable gains. However, they still suffer from (1) over-smoothing node embeddings caused by recursive convolutions with GNNs, and (2) the skewed distribution of interactions due to popularity and user-individual biases. This paper proposes a contextualized and debiased recommender model (CaDRec). To overcome the over-smoothing issue, we explore a novel hypergraph convolution operator that can select effective neighbors during convolution by introducing both structural context and sequential context. To tackle the skewed distribution, we propose two strategies for disentangling interactions: (1) modeling individual biases to learn unbiased item embeddings, and (2) incorporating item popularity with positional encoding. Moreover, we mathematically show that the imbalance of the gradients to update item embeddings exacerbates the popularity bias, thus adopting regularization and weighting schemes as solutions. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the CaDRec against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our source code and data are released at https://github.com/WangXFng/CaDRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

A Multimodal User Embedding Provides Personalized Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02965v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of social media, the importance of analyzing social network user data has also been put on the agenda. User representation learning in social media is a critical area of research, based on which we can conduct personalized content delivery, or detect malicious actors. Being more complicated than many other types of data, social network user data has inherent multimodal nature. Various multimodal approaches have been proposed to harness both text (i.e. post content) and relation (i.e. inter-user interaction) information to learn user embeddings of higher quality. The advent of Graph Neural Network models enables more end-to-end integration of user text embeddings and user interaction graphs in social networks. However, most of those approaches do not adequately elucidate which aspects of the data - text or graph structure information - are more helpful for predicting each specific user under a particular task, putting some burden on personalized downstream analysis and untrustworthy information filtering. We propose a simple yet effective framework called Contribution-Aware Multimodal User Embedding (CAMUE) for social networks. We have demonstrated with empirical evidence, that our approach can provide personalized explainable predictions, automatically mitigating the impact of unreliable information. We also conducted case studies to show how reasonable our results are. We observe that for most users, graph structure information is more trustworthy than text information, but there are some reasonable cases where text helps more. Our work paves the way for more explainable, reliable, and effective social media user embedding which allows for better personalized content delivery.</p></details> |  |

We then evaluate the performance using repeated 10-fold cross-validation on an in-house neuroimaging dataset of post-stroke aphasia. Our results demonstrate that LEGNet outperforms baseline deep learning methods in predicting language ability. LEGNet also exhibits superior generalization ability when tested on a second in-house dataset that was acquired under a slightly different neuroimaging protocol.

BNNs reduce the computational requirements and energy consumption of deep learning models with minimal loss in accuracy. However, training them in practice remains to be an open challenge. Most known BNN-optimisers either rely on projected updates or binarise weights post-training. Instead, QP-SBGD approximately maps the gradient onto binary variables, by solving a quadratic constrained binary optimisation. Under practically reasonable assumptions, we show that this update rule converges with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{T})$. Moreover, we show how the $\mathcal{NP}$-hard projection can be effectively executed on an adiabatic quantum annealer, harnessing recent advancements in quantum computation. We also introduce a projected version of this update rule and prove that if a fixed point exists in the binary variable space, the modified updates will converge to it. Last but not least, our algorithm is implemented layer-wise, making it suitable to train larger networks on resource-limited quantum hardware. Through extensive evaluations, we show that QP-SBGD outperforms or is on par with competitive and well-established baselines such as BinaryConnect, signSGD and ProxQuant when optimising the Rosenbrock function, training BNNs as well as binary graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Graph Neural Networks with a Novel Matrix Compression Format](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02208v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inference and training stages of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often dominated by the time required to compute a long sequence of matrix multiplications between the sparse graph adjacency matrix and its embedding. To accelerate these stages, we first propose the Compressed Binary Matrix (CBM) storage format to succinctly represent the binary adjacency matrix of an unweighted graph. Then, we show how to generalize this representation to normalized adjacency matrices of unweighted graphs which arise in the context of GNNs. Finally, we develop efficient matrix multiplication kernels based on this compressed representation. The matrix multiplication kernels proposed in this work never require more scalar operations than classic sparse matrix multiplication algorithms. Experimental evaluation shows that the matrix multiplication strategies proposed outperform the current state-of-the-art implementations provided by Intel MKL, achieving speedups close to 5$\times$. Furthermore, our optimized matrix-multiplication strategies accelerated the inference time of a GNN by up to $3\times$.</p></details> |  |

Along with climate change and consumer behavioral changes, this leads to changes and variability in generation and load patterns, introducing significant complexity and uncertainty into grid planning and operations. While the industry has already started to exploit AI to overcome computational challenges of established grid simulation tools, we propose the use of AI Foundation Models (FMs) and advances in Graph Neural Networks to efficiently exploit poorly available grid data for different downstream tasks, enhancing grid operations. For capturing the grid's underlying physics, we believe that building a self-supervised model learning the power flow dynamics is a critical first step towards developing an FM for the power grid. We show how this approach may close the gap between the industry needs and current grid analysis capabilities, to bring the industry closer to optimal grid operation and planning.</p></details> |  |

However, current graph interpretability algorithms tend to emphasize generality and often overlook biological significance, thereby limiting their applicability in predicting cancer drug responses. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc interpretability algorithm for cancer drug response prediction, CETExplainer, which incorporates a controllable edge-type-specific weighting mechanism. It considers the mutual information between subgraphs and predictions, proposing a structural scoring approach to provide fine-grained, biologically meaningful explanations for predictive models. We also introduce a method for constructing ground truth based on real-world datasets to quantitatively evaluate the proposed interpretability algorithm.

Typical HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Recent pre-computation-based HGNNs use one-time message passing to transform a heterogeneous graph into regular-shaped tensors, enabling efficient mini-batch training. Existing pre-computation-based HGNNs can be mainly categorized into two styles, which differ in how much information loss is allowed and efficiency. We propose a hybrid pre-computation-based HGNN, named Random Projection Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RpHGNN), which combines the benefits of one style's efficiency with the low information loss of the other style. To achieve efficiency, the main framework of RpHGNN consists of propagate-then-update iterations, where we introduce a Random Projection Squashing step to ensure that complexity increases only linearly. To achieve low information loss, we introduce a Relation-wise Neighbor Collection component with an Even-odd Propagation Scheme, which aims to collect information from neighbors in a finer-grained way. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on seven small and large benchmark datasets while also being 230% faster compared to the most effective baseline. Surprisingly, our approach not only surpasses pre-processing-based baselines but also outperforms end-to-end methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |
| **[Uplift Modeling Under Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19289v4)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects in e-commerce tends to involve costly treatment assignments which can be impractical in large-scale settings. Leveraging machine learning to predict such treatment effects without actual intervention is a standard practice to diminish the risk. However, existing methods for treatment effect prediction tend to rely on training sets of substantial size, which are built from real experiments and are thus inherently risky to create. In this work we propose a graph neural network to diminish the required training set size, relying on graphs that are common in e-commerce data. Specifically, we view the problem as node regression with a restricted number of labeled instances, develop a two-model neural architecture akin to previous causal effect estimators, and test varying message-passing layers for encoding. Furthermore, as an extra step, we combine the model with an acquisition function to guide the creation of the training set in settings with extremely low experimental budget. The framework is flexible since each step can be used separately with other models or treatment policies. The experiments on real large-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the state of the art, which in many cases performs close to random, underlining the need for models that can generalize with limited supervision to reduce experimental risks.</p></details> |  |

To leverage the approximation ability of neural networks, we proposed a general framework for optimizing and learning Nash equilibrium using neural networks to estimate players' cost functions. Depending on the availability of data, we propose two approaches (a) the two-stage approach: we need the data pair of players' strategy and relevant function value to first learn the players' cost functions by monotonic neural networks or graph neural networks, and then solve the Nash equilibrium with the learned neural networks; (b) the joint approach: we use the data of partial true observation of the equilibrium and contextual information (e.g., weather) to optimize and learn Nash equilibrium simultaneously. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with equilibrium constraints and solved using a modified Backpropagation Algorithm. The proposed methods are validated in numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an incomplete draft, we need to make more modifications</p></details> |
| **[VLSI Hypergraph Partitioning with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01387v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partitioning is a known problem in computer science and is critical in chip design workflows, as advancements in this area can significantly influence design quality and efficiency. Deep Learning (DL) techniques, particularly those involving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have demonstrated strong performance in various node, edge, and graph prediction tasks using both inductive and transductive learning methods. A notable area of recent interest within GNNs are pooling layers and their application to graph partitioning. While these methods have yielded promising results across social, computational, and other random graphs, their effectiveness has not yet been explored in the context of VLSI hypergraph netlists. In this study, we introduce a new set of synthetic partitioning benchmarks that emulate real-world netlist characteristics and possess a known upper bound for solution cut quality. We distinguish these benchmarks with the prior work and evaluate existing state-of-the-art partitioning algorithms alongside GNN-based approaches, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Packet-Level Header Traces Using GNN-powered GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01265v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel method combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating packet-level header traces. By incorporating word2vec embeddings, this work significantly mitigates the dimensionality curse often associated with traditional one-hot encoding, thereby enhancing the training effectiveness of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that word2vec encoding captures semantic relationships between field values more effectively than one-hot encoding, improving the accuracy and naturalness of the generated data. Additionally, the introduction of GNNs further boosts the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and synthetic data, leading to more realistic and diverse generated samples. The findings not only provide a new theoretical approach for network traffic data generation but also offer practical insights into improving data synthesis quality through enhanced feature representation and model architecture. Future research could focus on optimizing the integration of GNNs and GANs, reducing computational costs, and validating the model's generalizability on larger datasets. Exploring other encoding methods and model structure improvements may also yield new possibilities for network data generation. This research advances the field of data synthesis, with potential applications in network security and traffic analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fitting trees to $\ell_1$-hyperbolic distances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01010v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building trees to represent or to fit distances is a critical component of phylogenetic analysis, metric embeddings, approximation algorithms, geometric graph neural nets, and the analysis of hierarchical data. Much of the previous algorithmic work, however, has focused on generic metric spaces (i.e., those with no a priori constraints). Leveraging several ideas from the mathematical analysis of hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory, we study the tree fitting problem as finding the relation between the hyperbolicity (ultrametricity) vector and the error of tree (ultrametric) embedding. That is, we define a vector of hyperbolicity (ultrametric) values over all triples of points and compare the $\ell_p$ norms of this vector with the $\ell_q$ norm of the distortion of the best tree fit to the distances. This formulation allows us to define the average hyperbolicity (ultrametricity) in terms of a normalized $\ell_1$ norm of the hyperbolicity vector. Furthermore, we can interpret the classical tree fitting result of Gromov as a $p = q = \infty$ result. We present an algorithm HCCRootedTreeFit such that the $\ell_1$ error of the output embedding is analytically bounded in terms of the $\ell_1$ norm of the hyperbolicity vector (i.e., $p = q = 1$) and that this result is tight. Furthermore, this algorithm has significantly different theoretical and empirical performance as compared to Gromov's result and related algorithms. Finally, we show using HCCRootedTreeFit and related tree fitting algorithms, that supposedly standard data sets for hierarchical data analysis and geometric graph neural networks have radically different tree fits than those of synthetic, truly tree-like data sets, suggesting that a much more refined analysis of these standard data sets is called for.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 14 pages supplementary. 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

Traditional methods using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and heuristic algorithms can not well balance solution quality and speed when solving IPPS. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method. We model the IPPS problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture the complex relationships among operations, machines, and jobs. To optimize the scheduling strategy, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Experimental results show that, compared to traditional methods, our approach significantly improves solution efficiency and quality in large-scale IPPS instances, providing superior scheduling strategies for modern intelligent manufacturing systems.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

We present unique challenges pertaining to the representation and reconstruction in this problem setting. Most methods in the classical literature lack the ability to generalize based on object class and employ complex mathematical machinery to reconstruct reliable surfaces. We present a simple learnable approach to generate a large number of points from a small number of input cross-sections over a large dataset. We use a compact parametric polyline representation using adaptive splitting to represent the cross-sections and perform learning using a Graph Neural Network to reconstruct the underlying shape in an adaptive manner reducing the dependence on the number of cross-sections provided.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces RTop-K, a highly efficient parallel row-wise top-k selection algorithm designed for GPUs. RTop-K employs a Binary Search-based approach to optimize resource allocation and provides a scalable solution that significantly accelerates top-k operations. We perform a theoretical analysis of the effects of early stopping in our algorithm, demonstrating that it maintains the accuracy of neural network models while enhancing performance. Comprehensive tests show that our GPU implementation of RTop-K outperforms other row-wise top-k GPU implementations, with minimal impact on testing accuracy when early stopping is applied. Notably, RTop-K achieves speed increases ranging from 4.245$\times$ to 9.506$\times$ with early stopping, and 3.936$\times$ without early stopping, compared to state-of-the-art implementations. The proposed methods offer significant improvements in the training and inference of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing critical challenges in latency and throughput on GPU platforms.</p></details> |  |

We explore how machine learning can accelerate this process by learning a scoring function with a functional form that allows for more rapid optimization. Specifically, we define the scoring function to be the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligand and protein scalar fields parameterized by equivariant graph neural networks, enabling rapid optimization over rigid-body degrees of freedom with fast Fourier transforms. The runtime of our approach can be amortized at several levels of abstraction, and is particularly favorable for virtual screening settings with a common binding pocket. We benchmark our scoring functions on two simplified docking-related tasks: decoy pose scoring and rigid conformer docking. Our method attains similar but faster performance on crystal structures compared to the widely-used Vina and Gnina scoring functions, and is more robust on computationally predicted structures.

Utilizing the JSJ decomposition, a unique representation via a plumbing graph is extracted from a graph-manifold. Homeomorphic graph-manifolds are related via a sequence of von Neumann moves on this graph; the algorithmic application of these moves can determine if two graphs correspond to homeomorphic graph-manifolds in super-polynomial time. However, by employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the same problem can be addressed, at the cost of accuracy, in polynomial time. We build a dataset composed of pairs of plumbing graphs, together with a hidden label encoding whether the pair is homeomorphic. We train and benchmark a variety of network architectures within a supervised learning setting by testing different combinations of two convolutional layers (GEN, GCN, GAT, NNConv), followed by an aggregation layer and a classification layer. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different GNNs for this homeomorphism problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Yet, GNNs are often vulnerable to adversarial structural attacks as embedding generation relies on graph topology. Existing efforts are dedicated to purifying the maliciously modified structure or applying adaptive aggregation, thereby enhancing the robustness against adversarial structural attacks. It is inevitable for a defender to consume heavy computational costs due to lacking prior knowledge about modified structures. To this end, we propose an efficient defense method, called Simple and Fast Robust Graph Neural Network (SFR-GNN), supported by mutual information theory. The SFR-GNN first pre-trains a GNN model using node attributes and then fine-tunes it over the modified graph in the manner of contrastive learning, which is free of purifying modified structures and adaptive aggregation, thus achieving great efficiency gains. Consequently, SFR-GNN exhibits a 24%--162% speedup compared to advanced robust models, demonstrating superior robustness for node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the encounter of a vehicle with a dilemma zone (DZ) at a roundabout intersection is a pivotal concern. This paper presents an automated system that leverages trajectory forecasting to predict DZ events, specifically at traffic roundabouts. Our system aims to enhance safety standards in both autonomous and manual transportation. The core of our approach is a modular, graph-structured recurrent model that forecasts the trajectories of diverse agents, taking into account agent dynamics and integrating heterogeneous data, such as semantic maps. This model, based on graph neural networks, aids in predicting DZ events and enhances traffic management decision-making. We evaluated our system using a real-world dataset of traffic roundabout intersections. Our experimental results demonstrate that our dilemma forecasting system achieves a high precision with a low false positive rate of 0.1. This research represents an advancement in roundabout DZ data mining and forecasting, contributing to the assurance of intersection safety in the era of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network for Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00119v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of multi-modal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to analyze the genuine emotional state of each utterance based on the multi-modal information in the conversation, which is crucial for conversation understanding. Existing methods focus on using graph neural networks (GNN) to model conversational relationships and capture contextual latent semantic relationships. However, due to the complexity of GNN, existing methods cannot efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, which limits the performance of MERC. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) for multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. Specifically, we first use pre-extracted text, video and audio features as input to Bi-LSTM to capture contextual semantic information and obtain low-level utterance features. Then, we use low-level utterance features to construct a conversational emotion interaction graph. To efficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance utterances, we use the dilated generalized forward push algorithm to precompute the emotional propagation between global utterances and design an emotional relation-aware operator to capture the potential semantic associations between different utterances. Furthermore, we combine early fusion and adaptive late fusion mechanisms to fuse latent dependency information between speaker relationship information and context. Finally, we obtain high-level discourse features and feed them into MLP for emotion prediction. Extensive experimental results show that ELR-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD, with running times reduced by 52\% and 35\%, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 tables |

The proposed methodology leverages graph-based representations to effectively capture the spatial distribution and relational intricacies inherent in this decentralized network structure. This research work offers a novel approach that extends beyond the conventional Generalized Additive Model framework by considering models like Graph Convolutional Networks or Graph SAGE. These graph-based models enable the incorporation of various levels of interconnectedness and information sharing among nodes, where each node corresponds to the combined load (i.e. consumption) of a subset of consumers (e.g. the regions of a country). More specifically, we introduce a range of methods for inferring graphs tailored to consumption forecasting, along with a framework for evaluating the developed models in terms of both performance and explainability. We conduct experiments on electricity forecasting, in both a synthetic and a real framework considering the French mainland regions, and the performance and merits of our approach are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, ECML PKDD 2024 Workshop paper</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |

Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |

Accurate SOH estimation requires degradation-relevant features and alignment of statistical distributions between training and testing datasets. However, current research often overlooks these needs and relies on arbitrary voltage segment selection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative approach leveraging spatio-temporal degradation dynamics via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our method systematically selects discharge voltage segments using the Matrix Profile anomaly detection algorithm, eliminating the need for manual selection and preventing information loss. These selected segments form a fundamental structure integrated into the GCN-based SOH estimation model, capturing inter-cycle dynamics and mitigating statistical distribution incongruities between offline training and online testing data. Validation with a widely accepted open-source dataset demonstrates that our method achieves precise SOH estimation, with a root mean squared error of less than 1%.</p></details> |  |

However, this hybrid model, treating brain MRI volumes as grid or sequence structures, faces challenges in accurately representing anatomical connectivity, diverse brain regions, and vital connections contributing to the brain's internal architecture. Concerns also arise regarding the computational expense and GPU memory usage associated with this model. To tackle these issues, a lightweight hybrid sparse graph attention network (H-SGANet) has been developed. This network incorporates a central mechanism, Sparse Graph Attention (SGA), based on a Vision Graph Neural Network (ViG) with predetermined anatomical connections. The SGA module expands the model's receptive field and seamlessly integrates into the network. To further amplify the advantages of the hybrid network, the Separable Self-Attention (SSA) is employed as an enhanced token mixer, integrated with depth-wise convolution to constitute SSAFormer. This strategic integration is designed to more effectively extract long-range dependencies. As a hybrid ConvNet-ViG-Transformer model, H-SGANet offers threefold benefits for volumetric medical image registration. It optimizes fixed and moving images concurrently through a hybrid feature fusion layer and an end-to-end learning framework. Compared to VoxelMorph, a model with a similar parameter count, H-SGANet demonstrates significant performance enhancements of 3.5% and 1.5% in Dice score on the OASIS dataset and LPBA40 dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, GNNs are inherently not well suited to operate on dense graphs, such as in routing problems. Furthermore, models operating on Euclidean coordinates cannot be applied to non-Euclidean versions of routing problems that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel GNN-related edge-based neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). We evaluate the performance of GREAT in the edge-classification task to predict optimal edges in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We can use such a trained GREAT model to produce sparse TSP graph instances, keeping only the edges GREAT finds promising. Compared to other, non-learning-based methods to sparsify TSP graphs, GREAT can produce very sparse graphs while keeping most of the optimal edges. Furthermore, we build a reinforcement learning-based GREAT framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean asymmetric TSP. This framework achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Herein, we introduce Symplectic Graph Neural Networks (SympGNNs) that can effectively handle system identification in high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, as well as node classification. SympGNNs combines symplectic maps with permutation equivariance, a property of graph neural networks. Specifically, we propose two variants of SympGNNs: i) G-SympGNN and ii) LA-SympGNN, arising from different parameterizations of the kinetic and potential energy. We demonstrate the capabilities of SympGNN on two physical examples: a 40-particle coupled Harmonic oscillator, and a 2000-particle molecular dynamics simulation in a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of SympGNN in the node classification task, achieving accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art. We also empirically show that SympGNN can overcome the oversmoothing and heterophily problems, two key challenges in the field of graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

When deploying CDPRs in practice, the kinematic modeling is a key question. Unlike serial robots, CDPRs have a simple inverse kinematics problem but a complex forward kinematics (FK) issue. So, the development of accurate and efficient FK solvers has been a prominent research focus in CDPR applications. By observing the topology within CDPRs, in this paper, we propose a graph-based representation to model CDPRs and introduce CafkNet, a fast and general FK solving method, leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the topological structure and yield the real FK solutions with superior generality, high accuracy, and low time cost. CafkNet is extensively tested on 3D and 2D CDPRs in different configurations, both in simulators and real scenarios. The results demonstrate its ability to learn CDPRs' internal topology and accurately solve the FK problem. Then, the zero-shot generalization from one configuration to another is validated. Also, the sim2real gap can be bridged by CafkNet using both simulation and real-world data.

We evaluated the performance of our TempoKGAT on multiple datasets from the traffic, energy, and health sectors involving spatio-temporal data. We compared the performance of our approach to several state-of-the-art methods found in the literature on several open-source datasets. Our method shows superior accuracy on all datasets. These results indicate that TempoKGAT builds on existing methodologies to optimize prediction accuracy and provide new insights into model interpretation in temporal contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[The $μ\mathcal{G}$ Language for Programming Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09441v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks form a class of deep learning architectures specifically designed to work with graph-structured data. As such, they share the inherent limitations and problems of deep learning, especially regarding the issues of explainability and trustworthiness. We propose $\mu\mathcal{G}$, an original domain-specific language for the specification of graph neural networks that aims to overcome these issues. The language's syntax is introduced, and its meaning is rigorously defined by a denotational semantics. An equivalent characterization in the form of an operational semantics is also provided and, together with a type system, is used to prove the type soundness of $\mu\mathcal{G}$. We show how $\mu\mathcal{G}$ programs can be represented in a more user-friendly graphical visualization, and provide examples of its generality by showing how it can be used to define some of the most popular graph neural network models, or to develop any custom graph processing application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Predictive Features of Person-Centric Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Unfolding Ablation Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15294v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing novel predictive models with complex biomedical information is challenging due to various idiosyncrasies related to heterogeneity, standardization or sparseness of the data. We previously introduced a person-centric ontology to organize information about individual patients, and a representation learning framework to extract person-centric knowledge graphs (PKGs) and to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to examine the results of GNN models trained with both structured and unstructured information from the MIMIC-III dataset. Through ablation studies on different clinical, demographic, and social data, we show the robustness of this approach in identifying predictive features in PKGs for the task of readmission prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 34th Medical Informatics Europe Conference</p></details> |
| **[TG-PhyNN: An Enhanced Physically-Aware Graph Neural Network framework for forecasting Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16379v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting dynamic processes on graphs, such as traffic flow or disease spread, remains a challenge. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
